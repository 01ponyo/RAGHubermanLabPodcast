            "('42__transcript.txt', '- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\\nwhere we discuss science\\nand science based-tools for everyday life.\\n[light music]\\nI\\'m Andrew Huberman,\\nand I\\'m a Professor of\\nNeurobiology in Ophthalmology\\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\\nRecently, I had the pleasure\\nof hosting two live events,\\none in Seattle, Washington,\\nand one in Portland, Oregon,\\nboth entitled \"The Brain Body Contract,\"\\nwhere I discussed science\\nand science-related tools\\nfor mental health, physical\\nhealth and performance.\\nMy favorite part of each evening, however,\\nwas the question and answer period\\nthat followed the lecture.\\nI love the question and answer period\\nbecause it gives me an\\nopportunity to hear directly\\nfrom the audience as to\\nwhat they want to know most,\\nand indeed to get into a bit of dialogue.\\nSo we really clarify what\\nare the underlying mechanisms\\nof particular tools,\\nhow best to use the tools for\\nthings like focus and sleep.\\nWe also touched on some things\\nrelated to mental health\\nand physical health.\\nIt was a delight for me,\\nand I like to think that\\nthe audience learned a lot.\\nI know that many of you weren\\'t\\nable to attend those events,\\nbut we wanted to make the\\ninformation available to you.\\nTherefore, what follows\\nthis is a recording\\nof the question and answer period\\nfrom the lecture in Portland, Oregon.\\nI hope you\\'ll find it to be\\nboth interesting and informative.\\nI\\'d also like to thank our\\nsponsors of these live events.\\nThe first is Momentous Supplements,\\nwhich is our partner with\\nthe \"Huberman Lab Podcast,\"\\nproviding supplements that are\\nof the very highest quality\\nthat ship international and\\nthat are arranged in dosages\\nand single ingredient\\nformulations that make it possible\\nfor you to develop the optimal\\nsupplement strategy for you.\\nAnd I\\'d also like to\\nthank our other sponsor,\\nwhich is InsideTracker,\\nwhich provides blood tests and DNA tests\\nso you can monitor your immediate\\nand long-term health progress.\\nI\\'d also like to announce that there are\\ntwo new live events scheduled.\\nThe first one is going to take\\nplace Sunday, October 16th,\\nat The Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles.\\nThe other live event will take place\\nWednesday, November 9th,\\nat the Beacon Theatre in New York City.\\nTickets to both of those\\nevents are now available online\\nat hubermanlab.com/tour.\\nThat\\'s hubermanlab.com/tour.\\nI do hope that you learn\\nfrom and enjoy the recording\\nof the question and answer\\nperiod that follows this.\\nAnd last, but certainly not least,\\nthank you for your interest in science.\\n[light music]\\n\"What are the current best\\npractices for post TBIs,\"\\ntraumatic brain injuries for those of you\\nthat aren\\'t familiar with TBIs,\\n\"Especially long term,\\nmultiple,\" ooh, \"et cetera.\"\\n\"Thoughts on hyperbaric O?\"\\nI\\'m so glad you asked\\nthis, Danny Morledge,\\n\"As treatment for TBIs?\"\\nOkay, TBI...\\nNow, one thing about TBI and concussion,\\neveryone thinks football.\\nGuess what?\\nMost of the TBI is not football.\\nThere aren\\'t that many football players,\\nthey\\'re just large so they stand out.\\nThere might be a few here this evening.\\n[audience laughing]\\nOf course, football players are a concern\\nwhen it comes to TBI.\\nMost head injuries are going\\nto be construction workers.\\nHave you ever seen the\\nhard hats they wear?\\nThose, I don\\'t even know if\\nthey are just there for show.\\nIt doesn\\'t make sense.\\nAnd that we actually\\nhave a lab at Stanford\\nthat\\'s focused very hard on\\ntrying to solve this problem.\\nSo, construction workers, car\\naccidents, bicycle accidents.\\nPortland, amazing city to cycle;\\nI\\'m frankly afraid to cycle.\\nYou\\'re a small moving object\\naround these big objects\\nand people are staring\\ninto their little aperture\\non their phone while driving.\\nI mean, whatever happened\\nto that by the way,\\nof not texting while driving?\\nSomehow that just disappeared.\\nIt\\'s like, it really has just disappeared.\\nThere was all this science\\nshowing that it\\'s worse\\nthan drunk driving.\\nTBI.\\nWell, the basic rules\\nof the \"don\\'ts\" apply.\\nIf you get a head injury,\\ndon\\'t get a second head injury.\\nBut that often isn\\'t feasible\\nfor people that need to work,\\ncontinue working in construction,\\nor that are struggling.\\nWhat do we know?\\nWell, this is a great\\nopportunity for me to distinguish\\nmodulatory foundational tools\\nfrom things that directly\\nchange your brain\\nand nervous system the\\nway that you want to.\\nWhat do I mean by modulatory?\\nWe hear so much and\\nthere\\'s so many studies\\nshowing that great\\nsleep, quality nutrition,\\ngood social interactions,\\navoiding chronic stress,\\nand on and on and on are\\nimportant for everything;\\nthey\\'re related to Alzheimer\\'s,\\nthey\\'re related to ADHD.\\nI mean, we could do\\nthousands of podcast episodes\\njust returning to the same 10 things:\\nSleep, don\\'t stress too much or too long,\\ngood social connection, avoid\\ntoxic people, eat good food,\\nnot too much processed food;\\nWe could have an argument all night\\nand I don\\'t want to have one about whether\\nor not it\\'s mainly plants or this.\\nI mean, this is obviously\\neating high quality food\\nis something that we should all be doing,\\nwhich foods you select is a\\ntopic that is very barbed wire,\\nand I can give only my opinions.\\nAll of that modulates your brain function,\\nbut it doesn\\'t mediate or\\nchange anything directly.\\nIt\\'s setting a foundation\\nof what\\'s possible.\\nSo we should all be doing those things,\\nand especially people who have TBI.\\nNow, this question relates\\nto hyperbaric chamber.\\nHyperbaric chamber, there\\'s\\nsome very interesting data.\\nIt\\'s essentially a\\nhyperoxygenation of the brain\\nfor very brief periods of time.\\nI think the data on\\nhyperbaric chamber and TBI\\nare very encouraging.\\nThe problem is, much in the\\nway that a few years ago,\\ncryo was only available in a few places.\\nAnd now people are doing ice baths\\nand cold showers on their own.\\nIt\\'s hard to find a hyperbaric chamber.\\nThey aren\\'t just laying around,\\nand they don\\'t have\\nthem at spas typically,\\nand they are quite expensive.\\nSo, yes, there are\\ninteresting and important data\\nI think on hyperbaric chamber.\\nYou definitely want to\\nwork with a physician\\nor somebody who is very skilled,\\na practitioner who\\'s very\\nskilled in hyperbaric chamber.\\nThey do seem to improve brain\\nfunction by hyperoxygenating\\nthe brain for brief periods of time.\\nIt seems to improve a number\\nof things, but above all,\\nit seems to improve the\\nquality and duration of sleep,\\nwhich indirectly allows\\nthe brain to repair itself,\\nbecause as I mentioned earlier,\\nbrain change largely occurs in sleep.\\nSo if you don\\'t have access\\nto a hyperbaric chamber,\\nbut you do have TBI, what\\nare some of the other data?\\nWhat do those point to?\\nWell, I\\'d go on and on,\\nand you don\\'t have to get\\nthis from supplements,\\nyou can get it from food,\\nbut this threshold level of\\nthese EPA essential fatty acids.\\nThere are now so many data,\\nso much data on the valuable role\\nof these essential EPA fatty acids.\\nThresholds being somewhere\\nbetween one and two grams\\nper day of the EPA.\\nSo much so, actually, that\\nthere are now prescription forms\\nof EPA that doctors are\\nstarting to prescribe\\nfor people with TBI.\\nAlthough for most people\\nyou can get this through...\\nYou can look up and we\\'ve\\ndone podcast episodes\\nabout different ways to access this.\\nAlso functions as an antidepressant;\\nequally good, believe it or not,\\nin clinical trials to SSRIs\\nonce one gets over the one or\\nbasically two grams per day\\nof the EPA.\\nThe resident expert on\\nthe internet about this\\nis pretty extreme about the dosages,\\nand that\\'s Dr. Rhonda\\nPatrick, who by the way,\\ndeserves a nod of\\nacknowledgement and support\\nbecause it turns out that\\nbefore me or David Sinclair\\nor Matt Walker or any of these guys\\nwere blabbing to the world about\\nstuff that they had learned\\nin the archives of science\\nand in their laboratories,\\nthe first person in was this\\nwoman named Rhonda Patrick.\\nAs far as I know, the first\\npublic facing formerly trained\\nscientist to start going\\non all these podcasts\\nand risk her reputation\\nand this kind of stuff\\nthat you deal with when\\nyou put your neck out\\nthere like that.\\nAnd Rhonda\\'s, I think, terrific.\\nWe don\\'t agree on everything\\nand it would be weird if we did,\\nbut I think she\\'s really\\nbeen the proponent\\nof these higher doses of EPAs for TBI\\nand for cognitive function into all ages.\\n\"We often hear about ways\\nto increase dopamine.\\nHowever, are there effective\\nways to decrease dopamine\\nwhen you get too much of\\nit for certain behaviors\\nor habits we want to break?\"\\nKatie Hamm, I think is the last name.\\nThank you, Katie, for your question.\\nYeah, dopamine is a slippery slope.\\nAnd Dr. Anna Lembke is the expert in this,\\nand we\\'ve had a lot of conversations.\\nShe\\'s one of my closer\\nfriends on the faculty.\\nUnfortunately for her,\\nour coffee discussions\\noften last four hours or more.\\nHer poor patients and family.\\nHere\\'s the thing,\\nwhen dopamine is higher\\nin your brain and body,\\nwhen you\\'ve deployed it through excitement\\nor pharmacology or otherwise,\\nit tends to narrow your focus\\nand make you seek more of it\\nin that general theme that\\nyou happen to be focused on.\\nIt could be anything.\\nThat\\'s the scary thing about dopamine.\\nWhat can you do to control\\nit and to reduce it?\\nWell, for those of you\\nthat are engaging in habits\\nthat are healthy,\\nmaybe that doesn\\'t\\nrequire reducing dopamine.\\nHow do you define\\nhealthy versus unhealthy?\\nWell, I think the simplest\\nway to define addiction,\\nat least by my mind,\\nis that addiction is a\\nprogressive narrowing\\nof the things that bring you pleasure.\\nAnd a good life is a progressive expansion\\nof the things that bring you pleasure.\\nA rather simple definition,\\nand yet when we think about\\nthe biology of dopamine,\\ndopamine is not unique to one pursuit.\\nIt\\'s not unique to the pursuit of sex\\nor the pursuit of warmth when you\\'re cold\\nor cool environments when you\\'re too warm\\nor food or social media,\\nit\\'s just a dumb molecule that puts you\\ninto this forward state of\\nmass, small visual aperture,\\nand a kind of obsessive-like nature.\\nWhat can you do to counter that?\\nWell, the best thing to do\\nis to not get into that state too long,\\nbut if you do, the best\\nthing you can do is to try\\nand switch off that system,\\nnot through pharmacology,\\nbut by not pursuing more dopamine.\\nThe day after a big event,\\nthe so-called postpartum depression,\\nnamed of course because of true postpartum\\nafter the delivery of a child.\\nIt\\'s quite common for people\\nto get very, very depressed.\\nThere\\'s a lot of neurochemical\\nand hormonal adjustments\\nthat are occurring,\\nbut different types of\\npostpartum depression occur;\\nafter a big party, the Monday\\nblues, the Sunday blues,\\nthe post-whatever blues.\\nThe four month mark in a\\nrelationship is typically\\nwhen dopamine starts to drop.\\nI always tell people, just wait.\\nI\\'m telling somebody very\\nclose to me right now,\\njust wait four months,\\nfour months, four months,\\nand also spend as much time\\nwith that person as possible.\\nI don\\'t know what this deal is\\nabout not spending as\\nmuch time with people.\\nI think people are afraid\\nthat the dopamine wave pool\\nis just going to pull them both under.\\nI think they\\'ve called that\\nthe escalator model of relationship,\\nwhere you just sort of find\\nyourself in the relationship\\nbecause you went through\\nthe stages without\\nactually deciding on them.\\nIn any event, four months\\nseems to be the stage in which\\nthe dopamine crescendo\\nstarts to relax a little bit,\\nnot in a long distance\\nrelationship, however.\\nWe know this, right?\\nAnticipation is dopamine,\\nthat positive anticipation,\\nand there\\'s a whole\\nbeautiful science of this,\\nand I should say psychology of this.\\nThere\\'s a wonderful book actually.\\nThe name of the book\\nis embarrassing always,\\nI don\\'t know why, for me to say.\\nIt\\'s by a psychologist\\ncalled \"Can Love Last?\",\\nwhich is a psychoanalytic book\\nabout this dopamine-serotonin system\\nand the kind of seesawing back and forth.\\nAnd the fact that in relationships,\\npeople often just slam on\\nthe dopamine side of things\\nand then they hit a wall\\nand want to break up.\\nOr they go into this like warm,\\ncozy, fuzzy feeling thing,\\nand they go, \"Well, I guess\\nthe exciting part is over.\"\\nAnd this idea that one could actually,\\nor two people or however\\nmany people were in Portland\\ncould oscillate this seesaw.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI don\\'t think that you\\nwant to use pharmacology\\nto turn off the dopamine system,\\nbut for people that have\\na hard time sleeping\\nand that are really in\\na state of agitation\\nand constantly obsessing,\\nthe psychiatrists...\\nOne of the oldest and\\nmost effective treatments\\nis that the psychiatrists,\\nand this does have to be prescribed,\\nwe use a very, very low dose\\nof a dopamine receptor blocker,\\nlike Haloperidol, which is\\nused to treat schizophrenia.\\nA very low dose to shut down\\nthe obsession component.\\nThe smart, well-educated psychiatrists\\nknow this as a useful tool,\\nbut this is a one time\\nthing with a very low dose\\nbecause having your\\ndopamine blocked sucks.\\nIt does not feel good,.\\nBut not being able to sleep\\nand being in an obsessive mode also sucks.\\nSo it\\'s actually a very\\npotent clinical tool.\\nSo pharmacology is one tool,\\nbut really at the far end of things.\\nI believe that one should try and modulate\\ntheir own dopamine by\\nnot rewarding one\\'s self\\non a regular basis, but only randomly.\\nRandom intermittent reward\\nis truly the best schedule\\nof reward, hence slot machines and so on.\\nAnd you should engage\\nrandom intermittent reward.\\nAnd I think this is also the\\nway that we should train kids.\\nI call it training kids.\\nYou can tell I don\\'t have kids.\\n[audience laughing]\\nYou don\\'t reward them every time.\\nI don\\'t believe everyone\\nshould get a trophy every time,\\nnor should you always\\njust reward the winners\\nbecause those winners often,\\nwe see cases of this, high\\nprofile cases of this,\\nthey often crash and burn.\\nI mean the number of high performers\\nthat crash and burn publicly\\nand Lord knows how many do\\nit privately is remarkable.\\nIt\\'s \\'cause their dopamine\\nsystem is all messed up.\\nSo random intermittent reward\\nis the schedule of reward\\nthat we should impart on ourselves.\\n\"If you had 10 minutes a day to improve\\nyour brain plasticity, what would you do?\\nAnd when would you do it?\"\\nRichard Conlin, thank you.\\nWell, I\\'m going to say again,\\nI would absolutely anchor my physiology\\nwith morning sunlight viewing.\\nI can\\'t help it.\\nDo you know what\\'s interesting?\\nAnd I\\'ll tell you very briefly,\\nyou know what\\'s special\\nabout morning sunlight?\\nThis low solar angle sunlight.\\nI don\\'t think I\\'ve talked\\nabout this much on social media\\nor on the podcast.\\nThere\\'s a group at the\\nUniversity of Washington,\\na couple, Jay and Maureen Neitz.\\nThey run a lab together.\\nThat sounds like a horrible thing,\\nbut they do it and they\\nget along very well.\\nAnd they\\'ve discovered\\nthat the cells in your eye,\\nthe neurons that set your circadian clock\\nmake you alert during the day\\nand make you sleepy at night,\\nand so on.\\nThose cells respond best\\nto yellow-blue contrast\\nand orange tones.\\nNow, this is important\\nbecause when you go out\\nin the morning, even\\nif it\\'s not at sunrise,\\nbut it\\'s close to sunrise\\nor you look at the sun in the evening,\\nwhat you\\'ll see is yellow-blue\\ncontrast or orange;\\nyellow, blue, orange,\\nthat old thing from\\nkindergarten or first grade.\\nThat\\'s not the color of light\\nthat you\\'re going to see\\nwhen the sun is overhead.\\nNow, this also is really interesting\\nbecause artificial lights,\\nat least to my understanding,\\neven the daylight simulators\\nhave not picked up on this.\\nIt\\'s just about bright light.\\nSomeone ought to design\\nsomething that can mimic this,\\nbut nature has done\\nthis beautifully for us.\\nAnd so viewing low solar\\nangle sunlight in the morning\\nand in the evening is most effective\\nbecause of those yellow-blue contrasts.\\nNow here\\'s the really wild thing.\\nThose circuits that set your\\nlevels of alertness and sleep,\\nyes, they respond best\\nto yellow-blue contrast,\\nbut what that tells us is crazy.\\nWhat that means is that color vision\\nwas probably not related\\nto color perception first\\nbecause all of that is\\ncompletely subconscious.\\nThe pathways that do this\\nare present in people\\nwho are pattern vision blind.\\nSo, what do I mean?\\nI mean that color vision likely evolved\\nfrom a need to synchronize\\nyour internal state\\nwith the external world.\\nAnd the best stimulus in the outside world\\nto do that is yellow-blue contrast.\\nIn other words, our\\nability to detect color\\nwas first and foremost, and\\nwe understand this based on\\nevolutionary genomics and so forth,\\nto extract time of day information,\\nnot color of fruit or color\\nof skin or anything like that.\\nThat\\'s all secondary,\\nwhich is wild and crazy.\\nAnd this is yet another example of the way\\nwe think things work is\\nnot the way they work.\\nIt\\'s completely 180 degrees opposite.\\nI\\'m just going to give\\nyou a little teaser.\\nI had a guest on the podcast,\\nwe haven\\'t aired the episode yet.\\nHis name is Erich Jarvis,\\nhe works on speech and language.\\nHe also was admitted into\\nAlvin Ailey Dance Company.\\nAgain, who are these people?\\nHe\\'s a professor at the Rockefeller.\\nAnyway, I learned from Erich,\\nand you\\'ll learn when\\nthat episode comes out,\\nthat you only find elaborate\\nspeech and language\\nin species that also\\nengage in dance and song.\\nAnd the genomics point to the\\nfact that song and singing\\ncame first and language came second.\\nAnd that led me during that\\nepisode of the podcast,\\nI wrote down in my notes,\\nI was listening to him talk and\\nI wrote down in my notebook,\\nit\\'s just scrawled in big letters.\\nIt says, \"I am so happy right now.\"\\nI was just blown away.\\nAnd it makes so much\\nsense when you hear it,\\nthat the colors in the\\nsky were what our system\\nis trying to extract,\\nnot a perception of\\nthose colors in the sky,\\n\\'cause they\\'re informing us about time\\nand orienting us in time.\\nThat song and the communication\\nof emotional states\\nwould be simpler and more foundational\\nthan communication about\\nspecific patterns of language.\\nWhen you hear it, suddenly it makes sense.\\nBut of course we\\'re human beings,\\nand unless you\\'re Erich Jarvis\\nor Alia Crum or Anna Lembke,\\nyou think about all this\\nstuff backwards, as I do.\\n\"How can I navigate my way\\nthrough taking supplements\\nto optimize my health\\nwhen my career demands,\\nArmy infantry, prevent me\\nfrom being able to establish\\nconsistent routines?\"\\nAndrew Yagen, well thank\\nyou for doing what you do.\\nAndrew, so the consistent\\nroutine thing is tough.\\nHere\\'s what I can say\\nwithout going into a long\\ntwo and a half hour episode\\nabout jet lag and shift work,\\nwhich we\\'ve done.\\nThe most powerful way to anchor\\nyour brain and body in time\\nis indeed viewing sunlight\\nat consistent times of day.\\nThat\\'s not something I made up.\\nWe know this based on a\\nlot of work that dates back\\nto the 1930s.\\nThe second most powerful\\nstimulus is going to be movement\\nand changes in body temperature.\\nIn particular, increases\\nin body temperature\\ntend to make us alert,\\nand decreases in body temperature\\ntend to make us sleepy.\\nBody temperature drops\\none to three degrees\\nto get us into sleep.\\nWhy does a cold shower wake you up?\\nAdrenaline is released\\nand believe it or not,\\nyour body is heating up\\ninternally to combat that cold,\\nunless you make yourself hypothermic.\\nSo, sauna, hot baths to get sleepy,\\ncold showers, ice baths,\\net cetera to wake up.\\nSort of obvious when you hear it,\\nbut it\\'s counterintuitive\\nbecause you think,\\noh, heating up the body to wake up\\nand cooling down the body to go to sleep.\\nSo getting into cold\\nought to cool me down,\\nbut your body compensates\\njust like if you threw a\\ncold towel on a thermostat,\\nyou\\'d crank up the temperature in the room\\nand vice versa for heat.\\nOkay, so what do you do?\\nYou want to try and use\\nas many of these things,\\nlight, temperature, exercise, food.\\nWhen you eat is typically\\nassociated with waking.\\nVery few of us are capable\\nof eating in our sleep.\\nAnd then the other one is\\nsocial activity and rhythms.\\nNow the discombobulated person\\nis going to be the person\\nthat has not aligned these\\nthings in a consistent way.\\nSo while schedules vary,\\nand Andrew, I don\\'t know\\nyour exact schedule,\\nwhat I can say is if you\\nsuddenly go from daytime behavior\\nand sleeping at night to\\nthe so-called vampire shift,\\nas it\\'s called in the military,\\nand suddenly you\\'re up in\\nthe middle of the night\\nand you\\'re sleeping during the day,\\nthen when you come off that shift,\\nwhat you want to do is try\\nand combine as many of those\\nsame things at one time.\\nSo it would be get your sunlight,\\nso go jogging without your sunglasses,\\ndrink your coffee, engage with\\nother people and communicate,\\neat a meal afterwards or\\nas the case may be before.\\nTry and bring as many\\nof those things together\\nat the same time of day for a few days\\nand pretty soon your system\\nwill map around that.\\nSo the reason I encourage for those of us\\nthat are not doing shift work\\nto try and be fairly consistent\\nabout sunlight viewing\\nis it sets in motion\\neverything else that\\'s correct,\\nin terms of timing of\\neating, appetite will follow,\\nwhen your alert will follow.\\nYou\\'ll start to learn your own rhythms.\\nWhen you can\\'t control your schedule,\\ntry and combine as many of those cues;\\nagain, light, temperature, exercise, food,\\nsocial engagement into one period of time\\nand try and lock that into a more or less\\na one or two hour period or\\nplus or minus one or two hours\\nat a particular time of day\\nfor at least two or three days.\\nAnd your schedule, meaning\\nyour internal clocks\\nwill lock to that.\\n\"How is social media changing our brains?\"\\nThomas Adcock.\\nWell, you hear all the terrible ways\\nin which it\\'s changing our brains.\\nAnd I think that again,\\nwe go back to this thing,\\nis it the aperture that we\\'re looking at?\\nSo is it the format that\\nwe\\'re engaging in things?\\nOr is it the content?\\nWell, the way I like to\\nthink about the phone\\nis the way that we\\'ve been\\nengaging with the phone\\nand the laptop for that matter,\\nin staring into the small\\nvisual aperture each day\\nis sort of like walking like\\nthis all day long, right?\\nWe have this amazing\\nability to shuffle our feet\\nand take small steps\\nor to take big strides,\\nto run, to move...\\nI think that\\'s the sagittal\\nplane for movement.\\nI know it for the brain,\\nbut I always mess it.\\nThe PTs are vicious\\npeople online, by the way.\\nThe PTs and nutrition people,\\nI\\'ve learned to just not\\nsay anything about that.\\nI\\'m not a PT and I\\'m not\\na physical therapist.\\nAnd they do incredible\\nwork, but they\\'re like,\\nit\\'s a very spirited crowd.\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd the nutrition thing is really weird.\\nI mean, it\\'s just incredible.\\nPeople are either throwing liver at you\\nor they\\'re throwing celery at you\\nor they\\'re fasting or they\\'re not fasting.\\nIt\\'s nuts.\\nIn any case, the social media\\nand staring at a small visual aperture\\nis changing our brains.\\nHere\\'s one way I know in\\nwhich it\\'s changing our brains\\nand then I\\'ll tell you how to fix it.\\nIf you stare or look at\\nsomething within two feet of you\\nfor a certain number of hours each day,\\nyour eyeball actually gets longer.\\nAnd the visual image then is focused\\nin front of your neural retina,\\nnot onto your neural retina,\\nand you are becoming myopic; nearsighted.\\nAnd if you look at things\\nin the distance enough,\\nguess what?\\nYour eyeball changes shape\\nand your lens will focus\\nappropriately the image onto your retina.\\nIt takes some work.\\nKids that look at things\\nup close too much,\\nand adults that look at\\nthings up close too much\\nbecome nearsighted.\\nAnd there\\'s a beautiful\\nset of clinical trials now\\nwhere mainly in kids,\\nif kids get outside for two hours a day,\\ngetting a lot of this UVB and blue light\\nthat we\\'re told is so terrible for us,\\nbut they get it from sunlight,\\nthey actually can reverse myopia,\\nor reduce the incidence of\\nmyopia, maybe even glaucoma.\\nAlthough that\\'s a big maybe.\\nSo, how much staring into\\na small visual aperture\\nis too much?\\nI don\\'t know.\\nBut what we do know is that we\\nare literally becoming myopic\\nin terms of our vision\\nand we\\'re becoming myopic\\nin terms of our cognition.\\nAnd then there\\'s the whole business\\nof what\\'s actually\\ncontained in those Tweets\\nand those social media feeds\\nand those news stories.\\nWhich frankly, I feel\\nlike you lose either way,\\nwhether or not you\\'re\\nin one political camp\\nor another political camp,\\nyou\\'re upset about half of\\nthe information out there.\\nSo I feel like, and I\\'m\\nnot someone who knows\\nhow to talk about politics\\nwithout stumbling,\\nI didn\\'t do well in social\\nstudies in this sort of thing.\\nIt just never made sense to me.\\nIt just felt like the\\nprize goes to the person\\nwho can shout the loudest\\nand the most coherently\\nfor a moment.\\nBut I encourage, of course,\\npeople to be politically active.\\nAnd I vote.\\n[audience laughing]\\nBut the content is tricky to navigate.\\nAnd I can\\'t really speak to that,\\nexcept that it seems to\\nbe bothering everybody\\non one side or the other or in the middle.\\nAnd the format is something\\nthat we really understand.\\nAnd again, I don\\'t know of\\nmany people that are talking\\nabout this narrow visual\\nwindow format thing.\\nIt came up more during the\\nlockdowns when we were all inside\\na lot and not looking out at a distance.\\nThe data say really to try\\nand get at least 10 minutes\\nof long distance viewing,\\nso longer than 10 feet away from us,\\nfor every 30 minutes of closeup viewing.\\nAnd not a lot of us are doing that.\\nIf you\\'re walking to your\\ncar looking at your phone,\\nyou\\'re definitely losing an opportunity.\\n\"What new piece of neurological research\\nare you most excited about?\\nMateo Minato.\\nOoh.\\nI think the piece of\\nneurological research that I...\\nAll right, the weird stuff.\\nI\\'ve got this colleague at Stanford,\\nTony Wyss-Coray, and they\\'re\\nreally into literally taking\\nproteins from young blood\\nand young spinal cord\\ncerebral spinal fluid\\nand putting it into\\nolder people and animals,\\nand they get younger.\\nThat stuff\\'s pretty wild.\\nThe fecal transplant stuff is pretty wild.\\nYou take the microbiome from\\none person

fecal transplant.\\nNice.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI have never read the method\\nsections of those papers.\\nI\\'m actually afraid to\\nread the method sections.\\nI would say this is not neurological,\\nbut the work from Chris\\nGardner and Justin Sonnenburg,\\nalso at Stanford,\\nit makes it sound like I just like,\\n\"Stanford, Stanford, Stanford.\"\\nBut these are the people I\\'m\\nclosest to and surrounded by.\\nThere are excellent places\\neverywhere, of course,\\nincluding OHSU and I\\'m not just\\nsaying that \\'cause I\\'m here.\\nI actually close colleagues\\nhere and friends here at OHSU.\\nAlso an amazing, although\\nthat tram thing freaks me out,\\nit\\'s like I always just\\nhave all these ideas\\nabout what\\'s going to\\nhappen if that thing breaks.\\nBut the microbiome data\\nare really interesting.\\nI never understood why\\ngetting your gut microbiome\\nwas important.\\nAnd it turns out it\\'s because\\nyour gut actually makes\\nmany of the neurotransmitter precursors\\nthat your brain uses.\\nSo that\\'s pretty cool.\\nAnd I always thought it\\nwould be a complicated thing\\nto get your gut microbiome right,\\nbut it turns out that it\\'s fermented foods\\nthat seem to have the biggest effect.\\nThere was all this argument\\nabout fiber and yes,\\nfiber is important and\\nhere I\\'m getting nervous\\ntalking about nutrition,\\n\\'cause the people are going\\nto come at me with fiber.\\nBut it\\'s very clear from\\nJustin and Chris\\'s data\\nthat people who are\\ngetting four servings a day\\nof fermented foods,\\nwhether or not it\\'s kimchi\\nor sauerkraut or kombucha,\\nthat stuff actually seems to encourage\\na healthy gut microbiome\\nand people feel better,\\nand their immune system works better.\\nAnd I like this because it actually,\\nit resolves an issue which\\nis that high dose probiotics,\\nthese very expensive need\\nto be refrigerated things,\\nthose actually can create brain\\nfog and other issues there\\nfor real severe cases of dysbiosis.\\nSo I always like an instance\\nwhere one can look to foods\\nwhich are good, \\'cause I like to eat,\\nin order to resolve these issues.\\nIn terms of other neurologic issues,\\nfrankly, I think the stuff on dopamine\\nis fundamentally important.\\nSo much addiction, that\\'s a severe case,\\nbut also so much waxing\\nand waning of motivation.\\nAnd once you understand the\\ndopamine system and you say,\\n\"What activities am I engaging in\\nor pharmacology am I engaging in?\\nWhat am I doing to spike dopamine?\"\\nYou start to go, \"Oh, I get it.\\nThe waves in this wave pool are too high\\nand that\\'s why I can\\'t\\ndo this consistently.\"\\nAnd then you do the counterintuitive thing\\nof approaching things with\\na little less excitement,\\nbut then you\\'re able to\\ndo them more consistently.\\nIt\\'s like, \"Ah!\"\\nAnd maybe with some luck, I\\'ll\\nend up finishing this book\\nthat I\\'ve been

happening in his brain?\"\\nOh, boy.\\nMadison Cameron and everyone\\nhere probably familiar\\nwith Wim Hof.\\nWhose occupation on Wikipedia\\nused to be \"Daredevil.\"\\nThat was cool.\\nIt\\'s like Evel Knievel\\nhad it and Wim had it.\\nI got a story about Wim.\\nActually in 2016, I heard\\nabout this guy, Wim Hof,\\nand I got a hold of him,\\nactually his children.\\nAnd I had one vacation that\\nyear and I flew to Spain\\nand I spent some time\\nmountaineering with Wim,\\nwhich was absolutely terrifying.\\nI almost lost a leg legitimately.\\nI tied in wrong on a bridge sling.\\nHe told me it was good for me.\\nHe told me to, \"Stare\\ninto the lizard\\'s eyes.\"\\nAnd I stared into the lizard\\'s eyes.\\nI jumped backwards off this\\nhomemade bridge sling thing.\\nAnd I had the rope wrapped through my leg\\nand I came back with basically the tendon\\non the back of my knee exposed.\\nAnd sitting next to me on the plane\\nwas our Vice Dean of Research at Stanford.\\nAnd I had to explain to him\\nwhat I was doing and why.\\nIt was very embarrassing.\\nWhat did we do on that trip?\\nWell, a couple of things that will help me\\nanswer your question.\\nFirst of all, when I arrived,\\nI suffered terribly from jet lag,\\nbut the moment I got there,\\nWim did not say hello.\\nHe literally told me to\\nget into the ice bath.\\nAnd I did 10 minutes in the\\nice bath not because I\\'m tough,\\nbut because he held me\\ndown in the ice bath.\\nHe is indeed one of the\\nstrongest human beings.\\nHe reminds me of the bus\\ndriver on \"The Simpsons\"\\nor the janitor, excuse me.\\nNo, Otto is the bus driver, right?\\nThe janitor on \"The Simpsons,\"\\nlike [grunts] that guy.\\nThat\\'s Wim.\\nIncredibly physically strong guy.\\nWhat do I think\\'s going\\non with Wim Hof stuff?\\nWell, Wim Hof, whether or\\nnot he understands it or not,\\nI always think he\\'s sort of\\nthe Bob Dylan of breathwork.\\nLike everything he says seems\\nto have some intuitive sense,\\nbut you don\\'t really\\nunderstand what in the world\\nhe\\'s saying.\\n[audience laughing]\\nHe\\'s going to come after me now.\\nWe\\'ve had a good but\\ncomplicated relationship,\\nI\\'ll just confess.\\nMaybe someday we\\'ll resolve that.\\nNo big scandal or story there,\\njust we communicate very differently.\\nWim has a couple methods.\\nOne is to deliberately hyperventilate.\\nThis is also called Tummo breathing.\\nMy lab actually studies this.\\nWe have a paper that I\\'m happy\\nto share with you the results\\nalthough they\\'re not published yet,\\nwhere people do deliberate\\ncyclic hyperventilation.\\nWhich as the name suggests,\\nyou just breathe really deeply in\\nand really deeply out 25 times.\\nOr if you\\'re Wim, you\\'d say, \"In and out.\\nIn and out.\"\\nI just tell people, here\\'s how it works.\\nYou go [deeply breathing].\\nYou do that 25 times and you heat up\\nand you feel really agitated,\\nand that\\'s because of adrenaline.\\nIf you throw yourself into an ice bath\\nor a cold shower, adrenaline.\\nIf somebody upsets you\\nor you get a triggering text, adrenaline.\\nAdrenaline sounds like a terrible thing,\\nexcept when you deliberately induce it.\\nAs my colleague, David Spiegel says,\\n\"There\\'s a big difference\\nbetween going into a state\\nand you controlling your\\nentry into a state.\"\\nSo it\\'s not just about\\nthe state you\\'re in,\\nit\\'s about how you got\\nthere and whether or not\\nyou had anything to do with it.\\nStates of high adrenaline\\nare very powerful.\\nWhen you self induce\\nadrenaline by cold shower,\\ncyclic hyperventilation,\\nAKA Wim Hof breathing\\nor Tummo breathing,\\nyou then have an opportunity to create\\na very distinct mind-body relationship.\\nWe all hear that interoception\\nand the mind-body relationship.\\nInteroception just your ability\\nto sense your heartbeats\\nand what\\'s going on in your body.\\nPowerful, right?\\nTerrible if how you feel sucks.\\nSo interoception is wonderful,\\nbut when you\\'re anxious it\\nactually is more adaptive\\nto be able to maintain your thinking\\nand get yourself out\\nof that anxious state.\\nSo if you\\'re trembling and\\nyour body\\'s freaking out\\nand your cheeks are flushing\\nand your brain is following\\nyour bodily state,\\nwell, that\\'s not good.\\nAnd if you\\'re somebody and sadly,\\nthis happens a lot where you\\'ve\\nexperienced a lot of trauma\\nor typically this is people\\nthat have been bombarded\\nwith extreme criticism or physical abuse\\nor other kinds of abuse\\nduring development.\\nThey actually can seem very calm,\\nbut internally they\\'re\\nfreaking out in their head.\\nAnd they\\'re just thinking,\\njust get me through this.\\nAnd they just go into a state\\nwhere no one knows they\\'re upset.\\nI\\'ve known people like\\nthis and it\\'s eerie to me\\nbecause I\\'ve never had\\nthat response to stress,\\nbut it\\'s very common.\\nAnd so we should learn and\\nbe careful about deciding\\nthat people are in one state or another\\nbased on their bodily or\\ntheir mental response.\\nVim Hof breathing, cold\\nshowers, et cetera,\\nare a great practice in my opinion,\\nbecause they allow you\\nto spike your adrenaline.\\nAnd you can do that, for instance,\\nby making the water colder\\nif you want more adrenaline,\\nstaying in longer if you\\nwant more adrenaline,\\nmoving your limbs around in the water\\nwill give you more adrenaline\\n\\'cause it breaks up that thermal layer.\\nIt makes it a lot colder.\\nOr doing 50 deep inhales and exhales.\\nThat is very useful because\\nthen you have the opportunity\\nto use that prefrontal cortex and to stop\\nand sense all that adrenaline in your body\\nand yet maintain clarity of mind.\\nAnd that\\'s an absolutely powerful tool.\\nI would even call it a power tool.\\nAnd Wim figured this out.\\nI don\\'t know if you know this,\\nbut the way that Wim discovered all this\\nwas he was in deep grief about\\nthe tragic death of his wife.\\nShe committed suicide, jumped\\noff an eight story building.\\nJust truly tragic death.\\nAnd he was in situation, he\\nhad four children at the time.\\nNow, he has five.\\nAnd he was in a state of depression\\nand he ended up going into\\nthe canal in Amsterdam\\nand it was very cold and\\nit shocked his system.\\nAnd in that shock to his system,\\nwhich is caused by adrenaline,\\nhe somehow was able to anchor his thinking\\nand in kind of genius\\nof sorts, Wim thought,\\n\"Wow, I can intervene in my physiology\\nwith this strange activity.\"\\nAnd then he realized that\\nbreathing would do it as well.\\nYou didn\\'t have to get into cold water.\\nAnd then, years later, we discovered,\\nnot we meaning my lab, but other labs,\\nthat when you get into cold water,\\neven just 60 degree water,\\nthat there\\'s a very long\\nlasting increase in dopamine.\\nThat is 2.5x above baseline,\\nwhich is on par with\\nsome prescription drugs\\nfor increasing dopamine.\\nSo when people laugh at me and go,\\n\"Oh this cold water thing,\"\\nI get teased a lot on the internet.\\nI\\'ve heard on the internet\\nthat I eat sticks of butter,\\nwhich I never said.\\nI said, \"I like butter.\"\\n[audience laughing]\\nI\\'ve been told all sorts of things.\\nI\\'ve been told I eat sticks of butter.\\nI don\\'t know why.\\nI\\'ve been told that I\\'m dead.\\nThat was an interesting one.\\nThat was one of the cooler ones.\\nBut when I was going out\\nthere as a serious scientist\\nand saying, \"Using\\ndeliberate cold exposure.\"\\nYou can use all sorts of things.\\nOr if you come to my lab,\\nI\\'d be happy to put you in VR\\nand expose you to all\\nsorts of scary stuff.\\nOr we can inject you with adrenaline\\nor you can inject yourself with adrenaline\\nand titrate that, adjust\\nthe levels of that.\\nSo it\\'s a very powerful tool.\\nAnd I think that Wim and\\nothers deserve credit\\nfor really tapping into that.\\nAnd as a last point,\\nthere\\'s a beautiful study\\nin the Proceedings of the\\nNational Academy of Sciences\\nyears ago using this deliberate\\ncyclic hyperventilation\\nthing; 25 breath [deeply breathing].\\nAnd then another group meditates.\\nAnd then they inject\\nthem both with E. coli.\\nAnd the people injected\\nwith E. coli who meditate\\nget nauseous, vomit, diarrhea,\\nand they get a fever.\\nAnd the people who\\n[deeply breathing] first,\\nfar fewer symptoms, if any.\\nWhy?\\nBecause adrenaline actually\\nsuppresses a lot of these\\ninnate immune responses\\nin a way that\\'s healthy\\nin the short term.\\nThis is why you can work,\\nwork, work, work, work,\\nwhere you can study for finals,\\nor you can take care of a loved one\\nand then you finally stop\\nand rest and go on vacation,\\nand then you get sick.\\nStress activates your nervous\\nsystem and in doing so,\\nit activates your immune system.\\nMakes perfect sense\\nwhen you think about it.\\nHow would we ever go through famine\\nif you\\'re just getting flus\\nwhenever you\\'re stressed?\\nWe can deal with a lot.\\nMy suggestion is if you\\'re coming off\\na period of high stress,\\nto do some sort of\\nadrenaline spiking behavior\\nas you taper out of that stressful period,\\nnot going strictly to massage, vacation,\\nand yoga nidra all day long,\\nas I would reflexively do.\\n\"Can red light therapy help\\ntreat exercise intolerance\\nand fatigue in mitochondrial disease?\"\\nAllison, I\\'m glad you brought this up.\\nThis is another case where I thought,\\n\"Oh no, this red light stuff is crazy.\"\\nAnd then I went into the\\nliterature and it turns out\\nthat in 1908, the Nobel\\nPrize was actually given\\nfor phototherapy.\\nSo, there we go again.\\nAnd I have this slide,\\nI chose not to use slides tonight,\\nbut I have this slide that shows Ken Kesey\\nand the magic bus and\\nstuff from the 1930s,\\nand psychedelics and people\\ngetting into cold water.\\nAnd then here we are, 2019,\\n2020, you\\'ve got Wim Hof,\\nand Matt Johnson giving people\\nmacro doses of psilocybin.\\nWe\\'re right back where we were.\\nAnd one of my major goals is to really try\\nand create some scientific\\ndiscussion around these things.\\nThis stuff is crazy on the face of it,\\nbut there are mechanisms that\\nare real that underlie it.\\nRed light, because it\\'s\\nlong wavelength light,\\nlonger literally as opposed\\nto a short wavelength light,\\ncan penetrate through things like skin\\nand can indeed change mitochondria.\\nOne of the more impressive\\nresults on red light\\ncomes from my good\\nfriend, Glen Jeffery\\'s Lab\\nat the University College London.\\nI\\'ve known Glen for years,\\nand a few years, he was\\na basic vision scientist.\\nAnd a few years ago he\\nstarted using red light.\\nHe\\'d have people look at red light\\nat a distance of about\\ntwo feet in the morning.\\nSo is long wavelength light.\\nAnd sometimes even just take a flashlight,\\na torch as they call it in England,\\nand cover it with a red film.\\nAnd they would look at this stuff\\nfor a few minutes each morning,\\nand it can reverse some forms\\nof age-related vision loss\\nand macular degeneration.\\nHow we now know it can\\nprove mitochondrial function\\nin photoreceptors by\\nreducing what are called\\nreactive oxygen species.\\nHere\\'s what\\'s interesting,\\nit only seems to work\\nin people older than 40,\\nand it seems to only\\nwork if you do it within\\nthe first three hours of waking.\\nAnd the incredible\\nthing is you can do this\\nfor one or two minutes a week,\\nand some of the positive effects last\\nas long as three weeks.\\nAnd it\\'s affecting a very specific form\\nof visual improvement, which is acuity,\\nkind of fine detail stuff\\nin a particular wavelength.\\nSo, particular colors\\nand objects and things.\\nPretty impressive.\\nSo, yes, red light can\\nimprove mitochondrial function\\nto the photo receptors.\\nIf you are going to try and do this stuff,\\ndon\\'t put it too close.\\nI don\\'t have any affiliation\\nto any red light panel company.\\nSo I can\\'t say anything there.\\nThey are rather expensive.\\nNowadays, people are putting\\nred light everywhere,\\nand I do mean everywhere.\\nPeople are putting red\\nlight on their stomach\\nfor improving ovarian function,\\nwhether or not it can\\npenetrate isn\\'t clear to me\\nall the way down there.\\nPeople are trying to do this.\\nI have a friend, I won\\'t name him.\\nRecently, he told me he is really into\\nthe red light therapy.\\nHe\\'s putting it on his testicles\\nto try and increase testosterone.\\nBut he told me that after\\nhe handed me the red light.\\n[audience laughing]\\nTrue story.\\nMy team knows who this is.\\nIt\\'s no one on my team.\\nThank goodness.\\nI was like, \"Oh, that\\'s\\nsuper interesting.\"\\nI actually don\\'t think you\\nwant to contact the red lights\\ndirectly to your skin.\\nSo red light is powerful.\\nI don\\'t think we have, aside\\nfrom the vision protocol,\\nI don\\'t think that it\\'s clear\\nwhich protocols are best.\\nI will say if you\\'re into\\nred light infrared sauna.\\nTypically those don\\'t get hot enough.\\nTypically if you want to\\nget the benefits of sauna,\\nyou want to get between 80\\nand 100 degrees Celsius,\\nwhich is 176 to 210 or 208 Fahrenheit.\\nAnd I don\\'t actually do\\nthe conversion in my head.\\nI memorize it.\\n\"You mentioned the consequences\\nof blasting your brain\\nwith too much dopamine.\\nIs it possible to overdo\\nice baths while following\\nthe same line of thinking?\\nWill you experience an\\nextreme low in dopamine\\nwith too many ice baths?\"\\nLucas Ancke, thank you for the question.\\nAny behavior that spikes adrenaline,\\nyou will eventually get\\nbetter at tolerating it.\\nYou will become cold adapted\\nand you\\'ll become comfortable\\nat high adrenaline states.\\nAnd you just have to ask yourself this,\\nit\\'s just like lifting\\nweights in the gym or running.\\nYou need to leave some\\nspace for improvement.\\nSo if you run, as people do,\\nand you do your 5k, then you\\'re 10k,\\nthen you\\'re half marathon,\\nmaybe a 10k is a half marathon.\\nI don\\'t know.\\nBut anyway, then you\\'re\\ndoing your marathon.\\nThen you\\'re doing ultras that\\nare 50 miles and 100 miles.\\nI mean, eventually you\\'re going\\nto start doing damage, right?\\nAnd eventually you look\\nat every ultra runner\\nand typically these are\\npeople who are very much\\non the dopamine pursuit system.\\nI mean, I don\\'t think that he would mind;\\nmy good friend and a podcaster\\nwho I have tremendous\\nrespect for is Rich Roll,\\namazing human being,\\nand also has an amazing\\nstory about addiction.\\nHe was an alcoholic.\\nAnd I\\'m not sharing anything\\nthat he hasn\\'t already shared\\nin his amazing book, \"Finding Ultra.\"\\nHe got really into running,\\nrunning, running all the time\\nand there\\'s a dopamine\\nhistory there for him.\\nSome of us can use ice\\nbaths so consistently\\nand making it so cold and\\ndoing them longer and longer\\nthat indeed you\\'re playing\\nwith the dopamine system.\\nIs it bad?\\nWell, it depends on what\\nyou\\'re trading that in for,\\nat the expense of what?\\nIs it giving up cocaine?\\nYeah, great, stick with the ice bath.\\nBut you know, can only make it so cold\\nand you can only stay in there so long\\nbefore you become Wim Hof, right?\\nAnd it worked out for Wim,\\nbut there\\'s really only one Wim Hof.\\nAnd in general, that\\nspeaks to a larger theme,\\nwhich is I love the idea\\nof people using tools\\nand understanding mechanism.\\nI mean, of course I love that.\\nIt\\'s what I talk about and\\nthink about so much in my life.\\nBut for most of us,\\nwe don\\'t make a living doing those things.\\nAnd so I do think that the ideal situation\\nis to have behaviors and\\ntools that you intersperse\\nthroughout your day and\\nthroughout the week.\\nFor instance, I think\\nthree times a week is fine\\nfor the ice bath.\\nNo one said you had to do it every day,\\nbut you should see sunlight\\nevery morning if you can.\\nJust because if you miss a\\nday, your system will be fine,\\njust spend twice as long\\noutside the next day.\\nSeriously, \\'cause it\\'s a\\nslow integrating system.\\nBut for most of these\\nhigh intensity things,\\nthe less often you do them,\\nthe more powerful they are.\\nIn fact, if you get into a very hot sauna\\nfor four 30 minute sessions on one day.\\nSo you go 30 minutes,\\nget out for five minutes.\\n30 minutes, get out for five minutes.\\n30 minutes, get out for five.\\nTwo hours a day in the\\nsauna, that\\'s a lot of sauna,\\nbut the growth hormone release\\nfrom that type of protocol\\nis a 16x increase in growth hormone.\\nThis has been measured in humans.\\nWhereas if you do it every day\\nor three or four times a week,\\nyou get diminishing returns on that.\\nSo I actually am a big fan\\nof doing really intense stuff\\nonly every once in a while.\\nThis is also why I only\\ntake one long run per week\\nor one long hike.\\nFirst of all, I don\\'t have time for it.\\nI\\'m not an ultra runner.\\nI got other things to do.\\nAnd second of all, it\\'s a strong stimulus.\\nI\\'m sore until Tuesday,\\nor I don\\'t want to run\\nuntil Tuesday anyway.\\nI actually think that\\'s fine.\\nAnd I actually encourage\\nkind of more healthy,\\nrational schedules of\\nthese kinds of behaviors.\\nThere\\'s no rule that says\\nyou have to do something\\nevery day, even if you\\'re trying\\nto engage neuroplasticity.\\nYou can learn French or an\\ninstrument by practicing\\nthree times a week.\\nAs long as your practice\\nis very focused, right?\\nDaily perhaps would be better,\\nbut very few of us have the opportunity\\nto do things every day consistently.\\nAnd I really want to encourage\\na more balanced approach.\\n\"Before working for\\nThrasher, what\\'s the best...\"\\nOh, goodness gracious.\\nThe skateboarders are always in the

like\\nauthority and it was awesome.\\nAnd there was no nutritional plan.\\nYou drank your slurpy\\nand you sat on the curb,\\nand it was fantastic.\\nI don\\'t do that anymore.\\nBut the skateboarding community\\'s\\none that I\\'ve remained close with.\\nI did write for Thrasher\\nunder a different name\\nwhile I was a postdoc\\nto make some extra cash.\\nYou won\\'t find those\\narticles anywhere, I hope.\\nThey\\'re not very good.\\nAnd the best skate trick?\\nWell, I was involved in it\\nenough that this will only\\nmakes sense like three\\npeople in the audience,\\nbut I had decent heel flip.\\nI could nollie better than I could ollie.\\nAnd I was never very good.\\nOh, there\\'s more\\nskateboarders in the audience.\\nWhat I will say though,\\nis you have to be very\\ncareful with skateboarders,\\n\\'cause I don\\'t want to\\nclaim that I was any good.\\nAny success that I had was\\nout of sympathy of others\\nfor letting me hang around.\\nIt\\'s a great community.\\nAnd it gave me great\\nappreciation for indeed\\ncommunities of kids that\\ndon\\'t have structure\\nand sports leagues and teams\\nand all that kind of stuff.\\nNowadays, it\\'s actually a\\nmuch different landscape.\\nAnd I have to also say that\\nit\\'s really amazing to see\\nall the incredible girls and\\nwomen skateboarders also.\\nThere were none.\\nIt\\'s an Olympic sport\\nnow for women and girls,\\nand it\\'s an Olympic sport\\nfor boys of men too.\\nSo, it\\'s awesome to see that community.\\nOkay, \"What are your favorite brain hacks\\nfor doing hard things?\\nRanging from cold exposure to\\ngetting through selection?\"\\nHoby Darling, thanks for the question.\\nYeah, hard things.\\nWell, I\\'ll be honest.\\nI learned how to hack\\ninto my adrenaline system\\na long time ago through the\\nworst possible mechanism,\\nwhich is that I would set\\nup battles in my mind.\\nI would get into competition\\nwith people, imagined or real,\\nor I would get into states of\\nfearing shame and screwing up.\\nSo, this is what a lot\\nof people do I think,\\nyou end up scaring\\nyourself into trying to do\\nthe hard thing, and it works.\\nThe problem is it feels\\nrather like a downward spiral\\nbecause those negative states of mind\\nwork to liberate adrenaline and\\nget you through hard things.\\nSo being a kind of rebellious\\nkid, resistance was...\\nIf someone told me I couldn\\'t\\ndo something, I was like,\\n\"Yeah, try me\" and this kind of thing.\\nAnd as I mentioned before, I\\nwasn\\'t crazy about authority.\\nAnd so, that was the\\nmethod for a long time.\\nAnd then, I started reading\\nOliver Sacks\\'s books\\nand I started learning\\nfrom people who seemed\\nto access things through\\nthis whole love thing.\\nAnd I tried that love and\\nkindness meditation thing,\\nand that didn\\'t work.\\nAnd what I started doing was I actually,\\nI\\'ll just tell you before\\nI came out here tonight\\nand before I do anything challenging,\\nI just actually like to imagine the people\\nthat have supported me.\\nIt\\'s a weird tool.\\nI don\\'t think I\\'ve ever shared.\\nI\\'m actually slightly\\nembarrassed to share this out.\\n\\'Cause there are only two\\nthings that make me cry,\\nand that\\'s talking about my bulldog\\nand talking about my graduate advisor.\\nAnd if I talk it about any\\nlonger, I\\'ll probably cry.\\nBut I think about them a lot\\nbecause they were kind of similar.\\nThey were kind of ornery\\nand they were hard on me,\\nand I adored them both.\\nAnd so these days I try\\nand think about people\\nthat really, that I love.\\nAnd so I have been trying\\nto do this whole, like,\\ndoing things from a place of love thing.\\nAnd so, for me, that\\'s animals\\nand people that I love.\\nAnd okay, now, I better move on.\\nAh, thank you.\\n[audience applauding]\\nOkay, they\\'re telling\\nme one more question.\\nSo I\\'m going to answer one more.\\n\"What do I fear?\\nHow do you manage your fear?\"\\nKB, oh, gosh.\\nThis is going to turn into a\\nno one\\'s going to be satisfied\\nuntil I cry.\\nI get it, I get it.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI do cry, but again about the\\nthings I mentioned before.\\nI realized something, by the way.\\nWe just recorded an episode on grief.\\nIt hasn\\'t come out yet.\\nFascinating topic.\\nI realized at one point, by the way,\\nI\\'ll just give this away,\\nthat I thought I was really\\nsad about losing them.\\nI thought I would tear up really easily\\nbecause I was sad about them.\\nBut then I realized that this,\\ngosh, I can\\'t believe\\nI\\'m going to do this.\\nBut I realized that\\nfeeling that I was feeling\\nis the exact same feeling of love\\nthat I had when they were alive.\\nSo, grief is love.\\nAnd when you look at the literature,\\nit\\'s basically that, but\\nyour brain is freaking out\\nbecause that map of knowing\\nwhere people are in space\\nand time, grief is basically\\na remapping of the space:\\nWhere are they?\\nTime: When are they?\\nAnd then, this kind of\\nabstract map representation\\nthat we call closeness.\\nAnd grief is this process of\\nripping ourselves off of that.\\nSo, in any event, what do I fear?\\nTalking about things like this.\\nWhat do I fear?\\nQuite honestly, my biggest fear,\\nthe thing that would just\\nmake me feel just horrible\\nis I fear letting down my friends.\\nI have an amazing...\\nI love my family and they\\'re wonderful,\\nbut I have this incredible\\nrelationship to friendship,\\nand I adore my friends\\nand I would sooner give up\\nall my limbs and die before I would\\ndeliberately let them down.\\nSo, there you go, that\\'s what I fear most.\\n[audience applauding]\\nThank you.\\nThank you.\\nI also fear I\\'ve gone long.\\nAnd so my team has shut this down.\\nI just want to just briefly, two things.\\nFirst of all, I of course\\nwant to thank everyone\\nfor coming here tonight.\\nI realize it\\'s the middle of the week\\nand to commit some hours of your life\\nto thinking about these brain mechanisms,\\nwe got pretty nerdy there for a minute,\\nand hopefully the tools redeemed those\\nwho were only interested\\nor mostly interested\\nin practical tools,\\nbut hopefully some of the\\ninsights about how you work\\nwere useful as well.\\nI do want to just make brief\\nmention of the sponsors\\nthat made this possible, \\'cause\\nthey did make this possible.\\nAnd we made every effort to\\ntry and keep the ticket prices\\nmanageable for people.\\nAnd thanks to InsideTracker and Momentous\\nfor making this possible.\\nAnd then, of course I\\nwould be completely remiss\\nif I didn\\'t say thank you\\nfor your interest in science.\\n[audience applauding]\\n[audience cheering]\\nThank you.\\nThank you.\\nOh, wow, thank you.\\nThank you.\\nThank you.\\nThank you.\\n[light music]\\nThanks so much.\\nEveryone be sure to get\\nhome safely tonight.')\n"

of\\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\\nThis podcast is separate from my teaching\\nand research roles at Stanford.\\nIt is however, part of\\nmy desire and effort\\nto bring zero cost to consumer\\ninformation about science\\nand science-related tools\\nto the general public.\\nIn keeping with that theme,\\nI'd like to thank the\\nsponsors of today's podcast.\\nOur first sponsor is ROKA.\\nROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses.\\nAnd I'm delighted that they're a partner\\nand a sponsor for the podcast.\\nAs some of you may already\\nknow I've spent two decades\\nor more studying the visual system,\\nhow we see?\\nVision is absolutely\\nthe most important sense\\nby which humans navigate\\nthe world and survive.\\nAnd our eyes as two pieces of our brain\\ndo many other important things as well.\\nSo taking good care of\\nour eyesight is essential.\\nFounded by two All-Americans\\nswimmers from Stanford.\\nROKA was born out of an\\nobsession for performance.\\nThey've carefully put science and purpose\\nbehind their design choices\\nand they built absolutely\\nterrific products as a result.\\nThe glasses are amazing.\\nI love them because they look great.\\nThey are super comfortable\\nand the optical clarity is incredible.\\nThey filter out sunlight in a way\\nthat still allows you to\\nsee contrast and shadows\\nthe way you need to.\\nAnd for me, one of the things\\nthat's really irritating\\nis if I have a pair of sunglasses\\nthat don't allow me to see\\nall the things I want to see.\\nAnd with ROKA glasses,\\nI get incredible contrast\\nbut then I can also relax\\nand be outdoors in bright light.\\nAnd as the amount of light\\nchanges with cloud cover\\nand things of that sort,\\nmy ability to see my surroundings\\ncoz it's still really\\nsharp and really clear.\\nAnd that only comes from\\nreally understanding\\nhow the visual system works,\\nand how it adjusts to\\ncontrast and adaptation\\nand all these different things.\\nThey really understand the science\\nand that went into the\\ndesign of these glasses.\\nAnd as many of you know,\\nsunlight and the viewing of light\\nis also very important for\\nsetting circadian rhythm.\\nSo that's also been incorporated\\ninto the design and science\\nbehind these glasses.\\nI do wear readers.\\nI don't often wear them\\nduring the podcast,\\nbut I have to wear\\nreading glasses at night.\\nSo I use their readers and I\\nown a pair of their sunglasses.\\nAnd I'm delighted with them.\\nIf you'd like to check out ROKA glasses,\\nyou can go to www.roka.com,\\nthat's R-O-K-A.com and\\nenter the code Huberman\\nto save 20% off your first order.\\nThat's R-O-K-A.com,\\nenter the code Huberman\\nat checkout to get 20% off\\nyour first order.\\nToday's podcast is also brought\\nto you by InsideTracker.\\nInsideTracker is a\\npersonalized nutrition platform\\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\\nto help you better understand your body\\nand reach your health goals.\\nI'm a big believer in getting\\nregular blood work done\\nfor the simple reason that\\nmany of the important things\\nthat are vital to our\\nimmediate and long-term health\\ncan only be detected in a\\ngood quality blood test.\\nThe problem with blood tests\\nis that most blood tests\\nyou get a lot of information\\nback about that are too high\\nor too low of this thing\\nor the other thing.\\nBut making sense of that,\\nand what to do with that\\ninformation is very challenging.\\nEven if you have a really\\nattentive physician,\\noftentimes it's mysterious\\nas to what to do with all this data.\\nWith InsideTracker, they make\\nit very easy to understand\\nwhat all the metabolic factors,\\nhormone factors, et cetera,\\nmean for you and what to\\ndo about those markers.\\nSo they offer you directives\\nin terms of nutrition,\\nsupplementation, as well\\nas lifestyle factors\\nlike exercise, sleep, et cetera,\\nthat can allow you to take\\ncontrol of those numbers\\nand bring them into the\\nranges that are best for you\\nand your long-term health.\\nAnother feature of InsideTracker\\nthat's great is their inner age test.\\nThis test shows you\\nwhat your biological age\\nand how it compares to\\nyour chronological age,\\nwhich I can only imagine\\nmost everybody including me\\nare extremely interested in\\nhow long am I likely to live?\\nHow old am I really in\\nterms of my biology?\\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker\\nyou can visit\\nwww.insidetracker.com/huberman\\nto get 25% off any of\\nInsideTracker's plans.\\nUse the code Huberman at checkout.\\nToday's episode is also brought\\nto us by Athletic Greens.\\nAthletic Greens is an all-in-one\\nvitamin, mineral, probiotic drink.\\nI've been using Athletic\\nGreens since 2012,\\nand so I'm delighted that\\nthey're sponsoring the podcast.\\nWith athletic greens,\\nyou get a ton of factors\\nthat are good for you\\nmixed into this one\\nreally good tasting drink.\\nI like to mix mine with water\\nand a little bit of lemon juice,\\nand I drink that once or twice a day.\\nTypically, once early in the day,\\nand sometimes also in the\\nafternoon or even evening.\\nI'm able to sleep after drinking\\nin the evening just fine.\\nThe reason I been using\\nAthletic Greens for so long\\nthat I continue to use\\nAthletic Greens is that,\\none, I feel better when I take it.\\nI just do.\\nPsychologically,\\nphysically, I feel better.\\nBut also it covers all\\nmy bases of the things\\nthat I need for my general health.\\nIt's sort of a foundational\\nsupplement as I like to call it.\\nIn fact, when people ask me,\\nwhat should I take?\\nIf I were to recommend just one supplement\\nthat people take it\\nwould be Athletic Greens.\\nWith Athletic Greens, you\\nget support for your gut\\nwhich is important,\\nbecause the gut microbiome is important\\nfor the gut brain access,\\nfor mood, metabolism,\\nhormones, et cetera.\\nThere are so many data that\\nsupport that statement.\\nAs well, there are many\\nfactors in Athletic Greens\\nthat support general health metabolism,\\nendocrine factors, immunity, et cetera.\\nSo with Athletic Greens, I\\ndrink it once or twice a day.\\nAnd I know that I've got all that covered.\\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\\nyou can go to\\nwww.athleticgreens.com/huberman.\\nAnd if you do that, you\\ncan claim a special offer.\\nThey'll send you five free travel packs\\nplus a year supplies, excuse me,\\nof vitamin D3+K2.\\nSo you get the five free travel packs\\nand a year supply of D3\\nif you go to\\nwww.athleticgreens.com/huberman\\nyou can claim that special offer.\\nFor the last month four\\nepisodes to be exact,\\nwe've been discussing physical performance\\nand skill learning.\\nWe've talked about how\\nto learn skills faster,\\nwhether or not those are\\nskills, athletic performance,\\ndance, music, things of that sort.\\nWe've also talked about\\nhow to gain strength\\nand how to lose fat faster by\\nleveraging the nervous system.\\nThings like shiver and non-shiver,\\nnon-exercise activity\\ninduced thermogenesis.\\nWe talked about how neurons\\ncan actually trigger\\naccelerated fat loss.\\nWe talked about hypertrophy\\nalso called muscle growth\\nand we covered everything\\nfrom sets and reps protocols,\\nhow long to stay in a cold ice bath?\\nWhen to get out?\\nHow to keep shivering?\\nWe've covered a lot of\\ntools and a lot of science.\\nSo if you're interested in those things\\nand you even perhaps want\\nto learn a little bit about\\nhow we make energy ATP from\\ncarbohydrates or from fats,\\nit's all covered in the\\nprevious four episodes.\\nThis was going to be the time\\nthat we moved to a new topic entirely,\\nbut we are going to do one\\nmore episode in this series\\non physical performance.\\nFor the simple reason that\\nyou asked many questions\\nabout something that's vitally important\\nboth for physical\\nperformance and long-term\\nand short-term health\\nand that's endurance.\\nAnd so today we are going\\nto talk about endurance.\\nNow, if you're a strength athlete\\nor you're not interested in endurance,\\ndon't depart just yet,\\nbecause it turns out that there\\nare ways to train endurance\\nthat are very different\\nthan I would have previously imagined.\\nIf you only think about long runs,\\nlong swims, marathons,\\nhalf marathons, 10Ks, 5Ks\\nand that sort of thing puts you to sleep\\nkind of like Costello is\\nsnoring in the background\\nright now.\\nHe's not a long distance\\nendurance athlete,\\nthat's for sure.\\nIf you're interested in those things\\nor if you are averse to those things,\\nI encourage you to continue listening\\nbecause we are going to talk\\nabout a little bit of science\\nand then some specific protocols\\nthat really define what endurance is?\\nThe four types of endurance\\nand ways to train those in\\nconcert with the other things\\nthat you might be doing\\nlike weight training\\nor skill training or yoga.\\nAnd if you are an endurance athlete,\\nwe are going to cover a\\nlot of tools and science\\nthat I'm certain will also\\nhelp enhance your training\\nand performance in races\\nor even just recreationally.\\nThe topic of endurance I think\\nhas been badly misrepresented,\\nfrankly, online.\\nAnd when you'd start\\ndigging into the science\\nand you start talking to\\nreal experts in this area,\\nwhat you discover, what\\nI've discovered is that,\\nit's an incredibly interesting area\\nbecause it teaches us so\\nmuch about how our body\\nand our brain use fuels and\\nhow we can control which fuels\\nare used by our body and brain?\\nSo today we will talk about\\nthe four kinds of endurance.\\nWe will also cover the topic of hydration\\nwhich might sound incredibly boring.\\nLike, okay, just drink more water.\\nBut it's really interesting\\nbecause not only is\\nhydration a limiting factor\\non performance,\\nbut there is a right way to hydrate,\\nand there is a wrong way to hydrate.\\nThere actually is a formula\\nthat I'll teach you to know\\nhow much water to be drinking\\ndepending on your activity levels.\\nAnd if that sounds like a simple thing,\\nlike, oh, just tap off water\\nuntil your urine runs clear.\\nThat's actually the wrong advice.\\nIt turns out that if you\\ndon't hydrate properly,\\nyou can see 20 to 30%\\nreductions in performance,\\nwhether or not that strength,\\nwhether that's increasing hypertrophy,\\nwhether or not that's running, swimming,\\neven mental performance.\\nSo even if you're not an athlete\\nor a recreational athlete at all,\\nI encourage you to stay tuned\\nfor the part about hydration.\\nSo we're going to cover as\\nusual a little bit of science\\nand then we're going to\\ndive right into protocols\\nthat you can apply if you like,\\nand if you deem those\\ncorrect and safe for you.\\nBefore we dive into all that,\\nI want to make an important announcement,\\nwhich has all the episodes\\nof the Huberman Lab Podcast\\nare now housed on a single website,\\nwhich is www.hubermanlab.com.\\nIf you go to www.hubermanlab.com,\\nyou can find all the episodes in YouTube,\\nApple and Spotify format with links there.\\nThe website is also searchable.\\nSo if you go into the\\nlittle search function\\nwhich you'll find very easily,\\nand you put in, for\\ninstance, creatine or sleep\\nor ice bath or sauna,\\nit will take you to the specific episodes\\nthat contain that information.\\nAnd in addition, if you go to the website\\nwww.hubermanlab.com,\\nyou have the opportunity to sign up\\nfor what we call the\\nHuberman Lab Neural Network.\\nThe Huberman Lab Neural\\nNetwork is a zero cost resource\\nwhere once a month perhaps more often\\nyou'll receive a email newsletter,\\nand that newsletter will\\ncontain specific protocols,\\nannouncements, attachments of\\nPDFs and things of that sort\\nof protocols, tools and\\nscience from the podcast.\\nWe will also make any\\nannouncements about live lectures\\nwhich at some point I'll\\nprobably start doing\\nin various cities in the US\\nand probably around the world as well,\\nas well as other things that I think\\nwould be really useful to you\\nall of course at zero cost.\\nSo that's www.hubermanlab.com,\\nsign up for the Neural Network newsletter.\\nYou can find that in the menu tab\\nor it might pop up when you get there.\\nAnd I hope you will join.\\nAnd as a final announcement,\\nif you're not already\\nfollowing us on Instagram,\\nyou can go to Huberman Lab on Instagram.\\nAnd if you do that,\\nI often make announcements\\nand release protocols\\nand links to protocols\\nand things there as well.\\nI briefly want to touch on something\\nfrom the previous episode which is that,\\nif you are somebody that is trying\\nto increase muscle strength and or size,\\nor if you're simply somebody\\nwho doesn't want to increase\\nmuscle strength and size,\\nand you just want to maintain\\nthe musculature that you have,\\nit's vital that you\\nperform at least five sets\\nof resistance training\\nper muscle per week.\\nIf we don't do that, we\\nlose muscle over time.\\nAnd that is one reason among many\\nto have a regular resistance\\ntraining protocol.\\nNobody wants to start resembling\\na folded over envelope\\nor a melted candle.\\nNo one wants to have challenges\\ngetting up out of a chair\\nor off the ground.\\nMaintaining musculature is vital,\\nnot just to our immediate health,\\nbut to our long-term health trajectory.\\nSo I just want to emphasize that point.\\nIf you're curious about\\nthe sets, the reps,\\nhow close to failure to go or not go?\\nWhether or not you should be doing\\nyour cardiovascular training\\nbefore or after your weight training?\\nAll of that is in the previous episode\\nright down to the details,\\nand I like to think made\\nsimple for you to understand.\\nBut I do strongly believe\\nthat resistance training\\nwhether or not it's with body\\nweight or bands or weights\\nor simply lifting rocks in\\nthe yard or logs in the yard\\nis vital for our systemic\\nphysiology and our overall health,\\nand that includes our brain health.\\nAnd I described the reasons\\nfor that and the mechanisms\\nin the previous episode.\\nToday, I'd like to talk about endurance\\nand how to build endurance,\\nand how to use endurance for\\nthe health of your entire body.\\nEndurance, as the name suggests\\nis our ability to engage\\nin continuous bouts of exercise,\\nor continuous movement or\\ncontinuous effort of any kind.\\nAnd I do believe that our\\nability to engage in activities\\nthat we call endurance training\\nor physical endurance activities\\ndo have carry over to\\nmental performance of things\\nthat require long-term effort.\\nI'll touch on that at the end\\nand why there's reason to believe\\nthat there is a biological crossover\\nbetween those two things.\\nI don't think it's simply the case\\nthat if you train\\nyourself to be a strength\\nand speed athlete and to\\ndo short bouts of exercise\\nare very intense,\\nthat you can only do mental work\\nthat's of short bouts and very intense.\\nBut it is clear that\\ncardiovascular exercise,\\nexercise where you're\\ngetting your heart rate up\\ncontinuously for a period of time,\\nand endurance exercise we will define\\nwhat that is in a moment,\\nis vital for tapping into\\nand enhancing various aspects\\nof our biology in the\\nbody end in the brain\\nsuch that our brain can perform work\\nfor longer periods of time,\\nfocused work, learning, et cetera.\\nSo I want to dive into\\nthe topic of endurance\\nand I want to just begin\\nby addressing something\\nthat's vital to any kind of effort,\\nwhether that's mental\\neffort or physical effort.\\nSo as always a little bit of science\\nand we'll get right into protocols.\\nSo the key thing to understand\\nabout energy production in the body,\\nmeaning your ability to think,\\nyour ability to talk,\\nyour ability to walk,\\nyour ability to run is this\\nthing that we call ATP.\\nATP and mitochondria,\\nwhich are just little\\nwhat we call organelles within cells.\\nThese little factories that\\nmake energy, if you will.\\nATP is required for anything\\nthat requires energy,\\nfor anything that you\\ndo that requires effort.\\nAnd there are different ways to get ATP.\\nAnd we have been gifted as\\na species with the ability\\nto convert lots of things into ATP.\\nWe can convert carbohydrates,\\nliterally the kinds of\\ncarbohydrates eat a bagel,\\nyou eat a piece of pizza.\\nPizza usually is dough, and it has cheese\\nand some other things.\\nCostello hears me talking about pizza.\\nCostello loves pizza, by the way.\\nEating a piece of pizza,\\nit gets converted into various things,\\nfatty acids from the fats,\\nglucose from the bread,\\nand those things get converted\\ninto ATP within cells,\\nthrough things like like\\nglycolysis, things like lipolysis.\\nI talked about this in previous episodes.\\nSo our muscles and our neurons\\nuse different fuel sources\\nto generate ATP.\\nThe ones that are used\\nfirst for short bouts\\nof intense activity are\\nthings like phosphocreatine.\\nIf you've only heard about\\ncreatine as a supplement.\\nWell, phosphocreatine actually\\nexists on our muscles,\\nand that's why people take creatine.\\nYou can load your muscles\\nwith more creatine.\\nAnd though, and excuse me.\\nPhosphocreatine is great for\\nshort, intense bouts of effort.\\nSo when you're really pushing\\nhard on something physical,\\nlet's say you see a car\\non the side of the road\\nand that car is stalled and a person says,\\n\\\"Hey, can you help me push my car?\\\"\\nAnd you start to push.\\nThat's going to be phosphocreatine\\nis going to be your main fuel source.\\nThen you start to tap\\ninto things like glucose\\nwhich is literally just\\ncarbohydrate is the sugar\\nthat's in your blood.\\nAnd then if you keep pushing on that car,\\nyou keep engaging in a particular effort,\\nor you keep studying or you\\nkeep listening to this podcast,\\nyou start to tap into other\\nfuel sources like glycogen\\nfrom your liver, which is just,\\nit's like a little pack,\\njust like you might have packed a sandwich\\nor something for work.\\nYou have a little pack\\nof glycogen in your liver\\nthat you can rely on.\\nAnd you have fat stored in adipose tissue.\\nEven if you have very, very\\nlow body fat percentage\\nlike you're one of these people\\nas like 3% or 5% body fat\\nreally thin skin, very little body fat,\\nyou can extract lipids fatty\\nacids from that body fat.\\nIt's like a storage pack,\\nit is a storage pack for energy\\nthat can be converted to ATP.\\nSo without going into any more detail,\\nwhen I say today energy or I say ATP,\\njust remember that\\nregardless of your diet,\\nregardless of your nutritional plan,\\nyour body has the\\ncapacity to use creatine,\\nglucose, glycogen, lipids.\\nAnd if you're ketogenic, ketones.\\nWe'll talk about ketosis.\\nIn order to generate fuel, energy.\\nNow, the other crucial point is that,\\nin order to complete that\\nprocess of taking these fuels\\nand converting them into energy,\\nmost of the time you need oxygen.\\nYou need air basically in your system.\\nNow, it's not actual air.\\nYou need oxygen molecules in your system,\\ncomes in through your mouth and your nose,\\ngoes to your lungs and\\ndistributes via the bloodstream.\\nOxygen is not a fuel,\\nbut like a fire that has no oxygen\\nyou can't actually burn the logs,\\nbut when you blow a lot\\nof oxygen onto a fire,\\nbasically, onto logs with a flame there,\\nthen basically it will take fire,\\nit will burn.\\nOkay?\\nOxygen allows you to burn fuel.\\nSo today we are going to\\nask the critical questions.\\nWhat allows us to perform?\\nWhat allows us to continue\\neffort for long periods of time?\\nAnd that effort could be a run,\\nit could be a swim,\\nit could be studying,\\nit could be anything that extends\\nover a long period of time.\\nWell, you're going to need energy\\nand you're going to need oxygen.\\nBut the way to answer a question\\nlike what allows us to endure, right?\\nEndurance.\\nWhat allows us to keep going?\\nWell, we think of things like willpower.\\nBut what's willpower?\\nWillpower is neurons.\\nIt's neurons in our brain.\\nWe have this thing called\\nthe central governor\\nwhich decides whether or not\\nwe should or could continue\\nor whether or not we should stop,\\nwhether or not we should quit.\\nOkay?\\nSo whether or not you're somebody\\nwho has a lot of what\\nwe would call resilience\\nand endurance,\\nor whether or not you're\\nsomebody who taps out early\\nand quits early or can't\\nhandle frustration,\\nthat has to do with your fuel utilization\\nand specific neurons.\\nSo we have to ask the question,\\nwhat is the limiting\\nfactor on performance?\\nRight?\\nSo instead of saying,\\nwhat allows us to endure?\\nWe should say, what\\nprevents us from enduring?\\nWhat prevents us from moving forward?\\nWhat are the factors that say,\\nyou know what?\\nNo more, I'm not going\\nto continue this run.\\nOr you know what?\\nI've had a really long, hard day\\nor maybe I've had an easy\\nday or I'm feeling lazy,\\nI just don't even really feel\\nlike getting up and moving.\\nSo what we're going to talk about today\\nactually gets right down\\nto the heart of motivation\\nand fuel use.\\nMotivation and fuel allocation.\\nAnd we are going to talk about\\nspecific training protocols\\nthat you can follow that have carry over\\nbetween the bodily systems of\\nrunning swimming, et cetera,\\nand the way that your brain works.\\nSo let's talk about\\nendurance by asking first,\\nwhat are the limiting\\nfactors on endurance?\\nWhat stops us?\\nBecause in addressing\\nthat and answering that,\\nwe will understand what\\nallows us to get into effort\\nand to continue effort.\\nThere are five main categories of things\\nthat allow us to engage in effort.\\nAnd they are neurons, nerves, muscle,\\nmuscle, blood, things in our blood,\\nour heart and our lungs.\\nNow, I don't want to\\ncompletely write off things\\nlike the immune system and\\nother systems of the body,\\nbut nerve muscle, blood, heart and lungs\\nare the five that I\\nwant to focus on today,\\nbecause that's where most of the data are.\\nAs we go forward into this,\\nI want to acknowledge Dr. Andy Galpin,\\nwho as with the last episode,\\nhas been tremendously\\nhelpful and informative\\nin terms of the exercise physiology.\\nHe's a true expert.\\nHe has a laboratory,\\nhe's a full professor who\\ndoes work on muscle biopsy,\\nwho understands the science,\\nbut who also works with athletes\\nand works with recreational athletes,\\nprofessional athletes really understands\\nat a variety of levels how\\nall these systems work?\\nHe's the person I consulted\\nwith about today's episode,\\nalthough I did access\\nother literature as well.\\nAnd I'm going to mention a\\nkey review for any of you,\\nafficionados, who really want\\nto get down into the weeds.\\nBut I encourage you,\\nif you want more detail\\nto check out Dr. Andy\\nGalpin's YouTube page,\\nI think he's also on Twitter.\\nHe's definitely on Instagram.\\nHis content is excellent,\\nand he really understands...\\nI have learned and I really believe\\nthat an intellectual is somebody\\nwho understands a topic at multiple levels\\nof specificity of detail\\nand can communicate that.\\nAnd Andy is a true intellectual\\nof muscle physiology\\nand performance.\\nAnd if you hear the word intellectual\\nand you kind of back up\\nand cringe from that,\\nunderstand that he's also a practitioner.\\nSo thank you, Andrew Galpin.\\nAndy Galpin for your\\nsupport in these episodes\\nand we hope to have you as\\na guest on the podcast soon.\\nSo nerve muscle, blood, heart and lungs.\\nLet's talk about neurons\\nand how they work.\\nOkay?\\nBut I want to tell you about an experiment\\nthat's going to make it very clear\\nwhy quitting is a mental\\nthing not a physical thing.\\nSo why do we quit?\\nWell, an experiment was\\ndone a couple years ago\\nand was published in the journal Cell.\\nCell Press journal, excellent journal\\nshowing that there is a class\\nof neurons in our brain stem,\\nin the back of our brain that\\nif they shut off, we quit.\\nNow, these neurons release epinephrin.\\nEpinephrin is adrenaline.\\nAnd anytime we are engaged\\nin effort of any kind,\\nwe are releasing epinephrin.\\nAnytime we're awake really,\\nwe are releasing epinephrin\\ninto our brain.\\nIn fact, this little roup of neurons\\nin the back of our brain is\\ncalled the locus coeruleus\\nif you like.\\nIt's churning out epinephrin all the time,\\nbut if something stresses us out,\\nit churns out more and then it acts\\nas kind of an alertness\\nsignal for the whole brain.\\nWe also of course have\\nadrenaline epinephrin\\nreleased in our body which\\nmakes our body ready for things.\\nSo think about epinephrin\\nas a readiness signal.\\nAnd when we are engaged in effort,\\nthis readiness signal is\\nbeing churned into our brain.\\nWhen we relax and we're falling asleep,\\nepinephrin levels are low.\\nOkay, so they did a really\\ninteresting experiment\\nwhere they had subjects\\nengage in bouts of effort\\nof trying to move forward toward a goal.\\nBut they manipulated\\nthe visual environment\\nwith the stripes,\\nkind of like fences passing\\non both sides of them.\\nAnd by doing that, they\\ncould trick subjects\\ninto thinking that their\\neffort was either allowing them\\nto move forward, right?\\nBecause these rungs on the\\nfence were moving past,\\nor that their effort was futile\\nthat they were no longer moving forward\\nbecause they would make\\nthe runs move slowly\\neven though the subjects\\nwere making a lot of effort\\nto move forward.\\nOkay?\\nSo this is analogous or\\nsimilar to being on a treadmill\\nand you're trying to\\nwalk on this treadmill\\nand you just can't move\\nthe conveyor, right?\\nOr you're in virtual reality\\nand you're putting a ton of effort,\\nbut it seems like you're\\nmoving excruciatingly slow.\\nI had this experience\\nrecently in real life.\\nI was doing a swim in the Pacific,\\nI was trying to go\\nsouth and I was swimming\\nand I was caught in a current,\\nnot the cup that pulls you out to ocean.\\nAnd I kept looking to my left,\\nand I saw this hotel on the shoreline,\\nand then I was swimming and swimming\\nand swimming and swimming,\\nand 20 minutes later I looked\\nto my left and the hotel\\nis still exactly where it was before,\\nwhich meant that I wasn't moving.\\nIt felt futile.\\nEventually, either the current\\nchanged or something changed\\nand I eventually swam past the hotel,\\ngot back on the beach and\\neventually drove home.\\nThat's essentially what\\nthey did in this experiment.\\nBut what they found was these neurons\\nthat release epinephrin,\\nthere's another cell type called glia,\\nwhich actually means glue in Latin,\\nthat is paying attention\\nto how much epinephrin\\nis being released.\\nAnd at some point the\\nsystem reaches a threshold.\\nIt reaches this threshold\\nand it shuts off the\\nrelease of more epinephrin.\\nIt's like I quit, that's it,\\nno more effort signal.\\nIf they could extend the time\\nbefore those glia said, ah, enough.\\nIf they could release more\\nadrenaline into the system,\\nthen subjects would keep going.\\nSo our desire to continue\\nor put differently,\\nour willingness to continue\\nand our desire to quit\\nis mediated by events\\nbetween our two ears.\\nNow, that doesn't mean that\\nthe body's not involved,\\nbut it means that neurons\\nare critically important.\\nSo we have two categories of\\nneurons that are important.\\nThe ones in our head that tell us get up\\nand go out and take that run.\\nAnd the ones that allow us\\nand encourage us to continue\\nthat run,\\nand we have neurons that shut things off\\nand say no more.\\nAnd we of course have the neurons\\nthat connect to our muscles\\nand control our muscles.\\nBut the reason we quit is\\nrarely because our body quits,\\nour mind quits.\\nNow, we never want to encourage people\\nto drive themselves to\\nthe point of injury,\\nthat's not going to be good for anybody,\\nbut it is good to know that it's neural.\\nOur ability to persist is neural.\\nSo when people say is it, I hear that,\\nyou know, sports or effort or fighting,\\nor it's 90% mental, 10% physical.\\nThat whole discussion\\nabout how much is mental,\\nhow much is physical?\\nIs absolutely silly.\\nIt just proves that there's no knowledge\\nof the underlying biology\\nbehind that statement.\\nIt's neither mental nor physical.\\nEverything is physical,\\neverything is neurons.\\nYour thinking is the\\nresponsibility of chemicals\\nand electrical signals in your head.\\nSo it's not 90% mental, 10% physical.\\nIt's not 50/50.\\nIt's not 70/30, it's 100% nervous system.\\nIt's neurons.\\nOkay?\\nSo when people say mental or physical,\\nunderstand it's 100% neural.\\nAnd I'd love for the,\\nhow much of it is mental\\nand how much is physical\\nto just disappear.\\nThat argument means nothing\\nand it's not actionable.\\nNow, what do nerves need in\\norder to continue to fire?\\nWhat do you need in order\\nto get neurons to say,\\nI will persist.\\nWell, they need glucose.\\nUnless you're on keto\\nand ketogenic adapted,\\nyou need carbohydrate is glucose.\\nThat's what neurons run on.\\nAnd you need electrolytes.\\nNeurons have what's called\\na sodium potassium pump\\nblah, blah, blah.\\nThey generate electricity.\\nWe could go into all this.\\nI will probably do an entire lecture\\nabout the action potential,\\nbut basically in order to\\nget nerve cells to fire,\\nto contract muscle,\\nto say, I'm going to continue.\\nYou need sufficient sodium, salt,\\nbecause the action potential\\nthe actual firing of neurons\\nis driven by sodium entering the cell,\\nrushing into the cell.\\nAnd then there's a removal of potassium.\\nAnd then there's a kind of\\nresetting of those levels\\nby something called the\\nsodium potassium pump.\\nAnd the sodium potassium pump and sodium\\nand action potentials,\\neven if you don't know anything\\nabout that is ATP dependent.\\nIt requires energy.\\nSo you need energy in order\\nto get neurons to fire.\\nAnd it is pH dependent.\\nIt depends on the conditions\\nor the environment within the\\nbrain being of a certain pH\\nor acidity.\\npH is about how acid or how\\nbasic the environment is?\\nAnd we will talk a little\\nbit about pH in simple terms\\nso you can understand.\\nSo nerves need salt, they need potassium.\\nAnd it turns out they need magnesium\\nand you need glucose and carbohydrates\\nin order to power those neurons,\\nunless you are running on ketones.\\nAnd to run on ketones,\\nyou have to make sure that\\nyou're fully keto adapted.\\nI will talk about adding in\\nketones on top of carbohydrate\\nat the end of the episode.\\nOkay, so that's how nerves work.\\nYou need carbohydrate,\\nyou need sodium, potassium and magnesium\\nin order to drive the brain.\\nMuscle.\\nMuscle is going to engage\\nin generating energy first\\nby using this phosphocreatine system.\\nHigh bouts of effort\\nreally intense effort,\\nshort-lived seconds to minutes,\\nbut probably more like seconds\\nis going to be this phosphate\\ncreating literally a fuel source\\nin the muscle that you're going to burn,\\njust like you would logs on a fire.\\nAnd glycogen which is stored\\ncarbohydrate in the muscle,\\nthat also can be burned\\njust like logs on a fire\\nto generate energy.\\nSo let me make this crystal clear.\\nIf you move your wrist\\ntowards your shoulder\\nand contract your bicep really hard,\\nmuscle fibers are burning\\nup their own carbohydrate.\\nThey're converting that into ATP\\nin order to generate that energy.\\nOkay?\\nAnd pH is important and\\ntemperature is important.\\nIn the episode on supercharge\\nyour physical performance,\\nI talked all about how by\\nusing cooling specifically\\nof the palms or the bottoms of the feet\\nor the cheeks of the face\\nusing particular methods,\\nyou can adjust the temperature\\nof the body and of muscle\\nin a way that allows you to do more work,\\nto do more reps, to run further,\\nto keep going and to persist.\\nAnd that's because if temperature\\nis too low or too high,\\nthen ATP is not going to be available\\nbecause of this whole thing\\ncalled the pyruvate kinase pathway\\nand the temperature\\ndependence of pyruvate kinase.\\nCheck out that episode if you\\nwant to learn more about that.\\nBut temperature is important\\nand pH is also important.\\nSo we got nerve, muscle,\\nand then there's stuff in our blood\\nthat's available as an energy source.\\nAnd in blood, we got glucose.\\nSo literally blood sugar\\nthat's floating around.\\nSo let's say you have\\nfasted for three days,\\nyour blood glucose is\\ngoing to be very low.\\nSo that's not going to\\nbe a great fuel source,\\nbut you will start to liberate fats\\nfrom your adipose tissue from your fat.\\nFatty acids will start to\\nmobilize into the bloodstream\\nand you can burn those for energy.\\nAnd oxygen in your blood when\\nyou inhale, [inhales deeply]\\nyou're bringing oxygen into your blood.\\nSo these are all fuel\\nsources in your neurons,\\nin your muscle, in your blood,\\nin your various tissues that\\nare providing the opportunity\\nto induce effort whether\\nor not it's a run or swim\\nor writing or talking.\\nNow, there are some other\\nfactors that are important\\nand those are the heart\\nwhich is going to move blood.\\nSo the more that the heart\\ncan move blood and oxygen,\\nwell, the more fuel that's\\ngoing to be available for you\\nto engage in muscular\\neffort and thinking effort.\\nSo your heart vitally important\\nto your muscles ability\\nto work and your brain's ability to work.\\nAnd as I've mentioned, oxygen a few times,\\nit should be obvious then that\\nthe lungs are very important.\\nYou need to bring oxygen in,\\nand distribute it to all these tissues,\\nbecause oxygen is critical\\nfor the conversion\\nof carbohydrates and\\nthe conversion of fats.\\nAnd we could get into the discussion about\\nwhether or not oxygen is important\\nfor ketogenic metabolism,\\nbut you need oxygen there,\\nyou need to breathe and you\\nneed to breathe properly.\\nSo I just covered what would\\nnormally be about four lectures\\nof energy consumption\\nand energy utilization.\\nI didn't go into much detail at all.\\nBut what I want you to imagine is that,\\nyou've got these different cell types.\\nYou've got neurons, you've got muscle,\\nthey need to collaborate\\nin order to generate effort\\nor to make the decision to do something\\nor to think hard or to\\nrun hard or to run far.\\nAnd then you've got fuel\\nsources both in the neurons,\\nin the muscle, in your blood,\\nand then the heart and\\nlungs are going to help\\ndistribute the oxygen and those fuels.\\nAnd of course you have\\nthat little energy pack\\nthat we call the liver that\\nwill allow you to pull out\\na little more carbohydrate\\nif you need it for work.\\nOkay?\\nSo that's as much as I want to\\ncover about energy consumption,\\nbecause that's a lot.\\nBut what it tells you is that when you eat\\nand you use food as a fuel source,\\nthat food can be broken down\\nand you can immediately burn the glucose\\nthat's in your bloodstream,\\nor you can rely on some of\\nthe stored fuel in your liver,\\nor you can rely on stored\\nfuel in the muscle,\\nso-called glycogen.\\nAnd there are a lot of different ways\\nthat we can generate ATP.\\nSo when we ask the question,\\nwhat's limiting for performance?\\nWhat is going to allow us to endure,\\nto engage in effort and\\nendure long bouts of effort\\nor even moderately long bouts of effort?\\nWe need to ask which of those things,\\nnerve, muscle, blood, heart\\nand lungs is limiting?\\nOr put differently,\\nwe ask, what should we be\\ndoing with our neurons?\\nWhat should we be doing with our muscles?\\nWhat should we be doing with our blood?\\nWhat should we be doing with our heart\\nand what should we be doing with our lungs\\nthat's going to allow\\nus to build endurance\\nfor mental and physical work\\nand to be able to go longer,\\nfurther with more intensity?\\nThat's the real question?\\nHow can we do more work?\\nAnd the way we do that is with energy,\\nand the way to get energy to it,\\nis to buy those five things.\\nAnd so now we're going to talk about,\\nhow you can actually build\\ndifferent types of endurance?\\nAnd what that does at\\nthe level of your blood,\\nyour heart, your muscles and your neurons.\\nSo we're going to skip back and\\nforth between protocols, tools\\nand the underlying science.\\nSo rather than heavy stack\\nthe science at the front end\\nand then just give you\\nall the tools at the end,\\nwe're going to talk about the protocols,\\nthe four kinds of endurance\\nand how to achieve them?\\nAnd we are going to talk\\nabout the underlying science\\nas we move through that.\\nIf you would like a lot\\nof detailed science,\\nI encourage you to check out a review\\nthat we've linked in the show notes.\\nAnd the review is called\\nadaptations to endurance\\nand strength training.\\nThis is a review article with\\nmany excellent citations.\\nIt's from Cold Spring Harbor\\nPerspectives in Medicine.\\nThe Cold Spring Harbor Press\\nis an excellent scientific press.\\nSpent the last 21 years doing\\nsummers at Cold Spring Harbor\\nteaching neuroscience,\\nbut Cold Spring Harbor is\\ninvolved in all sorts of themes\\nand topics related to\\nneuroscience and medicine.\\nThis review by Hughes L.Ellefson.\\nEllefson that's the name.\\nEllefson and Barr, B-A-A-R.\\nAdaptations through endurance\\nand strength training\\nis rich with citations.\\nIt can be downloaded as a complete PDF.\\nThere's no paywall and we will link to it.\\nAnd it gets really deep into\\nall the signaling cascades,\\nthe genetic changes within muscle\\nwith high intensity interval training,\\nshort-term, super high intensity\\ntraining, weight training.\\nSo if you're a real nerd for this stuff\\nand you want to get right\\ndown into how PGC-1alpha,\\nP53 and PH20 change the\\nadaptation features of muscle\\nand gene regulation,\\nthat is definitely the review for you.\\nIf you're like most people,\\nand you're not really interested\\nin that level of detail,\\nno reason to pick up the review,\\nunless you just want to check out\\nsome of the figures and pictures.\\nBut I do want to offer that as a resource\\nit's been in addition to\\ndiscussions with Dr. Andy Galpin,\\nit's been a primary\\nresource for the content\\nof this episode.\\nSo let's talk about the\\nfour kinds of endurance\\nand how to achieve those?\\nI do believe that everybody\\nshould have some sort\\nof endurance practice,\\nregular endurance practice.\\nIt's clear that it's vital for\\nthe functioning of the body\\nand the mind.\\nAnd there are clear longevity benefits.\\nThere are a lot of\\nreasons why that's true,\\nbut the main one is that if we\\nhave good energy utilization\\nin our musculature and in our blood,\\nin our vascular system and\\nin our oxygenating system,\\nour lungs, the so-called\\ncardiovascular system,\\nrespiratory system and musculature.\\nThe body and brain function much better.\\nThere are so many papers now,\\nso much data to support that.\\nSo I do believe everyone\\nshould either try to maintain\\nthe muscle that they have,\\nprovided they've already\\ngone through puberty\\nand development.\\nAnd they should be engaged in\\nregular endurance exercise.\\nNow, for many people, they\\nthink endurance exercise.\\nThat means what?\\nA hour long run or I got\\nto get on the StairMaster\\nor I have to treadmill for\\nhours on end each week.\\nAnd it turns out that's not the case.\\nThere are four kinds of endurance,\\nand you can train specifically\\nfor any one of those,\\nand you can vary your training.\\nSo let's talk about those\\nfour kinds of endurance.\\nThese are very interesting\\nand they each have very\\ndifferent protocols\\nthat you use in order to\\nbuild and maximize them.\\nAnd now you'll understand\\nwhat fuel sources they use\\nin order to build that\\nthing we call endurance.\\nSo first of all, we\\nhave muscular endurance.\\nMuscular endurance is the\\nability for our muscles\\nto perform work over time,\\nand our failure to continue\\nto be able to perform\\nthat work is going to be\\ndue to muscular fatigue,\\nnot to cardiovascular fatigue.\\nSo not because we're breathing too hard\\nor we can't get enough\\nblood to the muscles\\nor because we quit mentally,\\nbut because the muscles\\nthemselves give out.\\nOkay?\\nOne good example of this would be,\\nif you had to pick up a stone in the yard\\nand that stone is not\\nextremely heavy for you,\\nand you needed to do that\\nanywhere from 50 to a 100 times,\\nand you were picking it\\nup and putting it down\\nand picking it up and putting it down\\nand picking up and putting it down.\\nAt some point, your muscles will fatigue.\\nThey will fail to endure.\\nMuscular endurance is incredibly useful\\nfor a variety of physical pursuits.\\nAnd we will talk about the mental pursuits\\nthat it supports as well.\\nIn terms of physical pursuits,\\nthe ability for a given muscle\\nto perform repeated work\\nis going to improve your golf swing.\\nIt's going to improve your tennis swing.\\nIt's going to improve your posture,\\nyour ability to dance,\\nyour ability to repeatedly\\nengage in an activity\\nthat requires effort in a\\nway that's very different\\nfrom the kind of endurance\\nthat you will build simply\\nby increasing your cardiovascular fitness,\\nyour ability to generate\\nkind of easy repetition.\\nSo let's talk about muscular\\nendurance and what it is?\\nMuscular endurance is\\ngoing to be something\\nthat you can perform for\\nanywhere from 12 to 25,\\nor even up to 100 repetitions.\\nAnd that's actually how if you like\\nyou would train muscular endurance.\\nAnd I'll give the specific\\nprotocol in a few moments.\\nSo a good example is push-ups, right?\\nIf you were to get on the\\nfloor and start doing push-ups,\\neven if you're somebody who\\nhas to do knees down push-ups,\\nand you're doing your push-ups,\\neventually you won't be\\nable to do any more push-ups\\nand that's not going to be\\nbecause you couldn't get enough\\noxygen into your system,\\nor your heart wasn't pumping enough blood.\\nIt's going to be because the muscles fail.\\nThat's why.\\nSo if you want to be\\nable to do more push-ups\\nor even more pull-ups.\\nMuscular endurance is\\nreally what it's about.\\nIt's actually no coincidence\\nthat a lot of military bootcamp\\nstyle training is not done with weights,\\nit's done with things\\nlike push-ups, pull-ups,\\nsit-ups and running.\\nBecause what they're really\\nbuilding is muscular endurance.\\nThe ability to perform\\nwork repeatedly over time\\nfor a given set of muscles and neurons.\\nSo what's a good protocol\\nto build muscular endurance.\\nLet's just give that to you now\\nand explain some of the\\nunderlying science as it follows.\\nSo a really good muscular\\nendurance training protocol\\naccording to the scientific\\nliterature would be,\\nthree to five sets of anywhere\\nfrom 12 to 100 repetitions.\\nThat's a huge range.\\nNow, 12 to 25 repetitions is\\ngoing to be more reasonable\\nfor most people.\\nAnd the rest periods\\nare going to be anywhere\\nfrom 30 to 180 seconds of rest.\\nSo anywhere from half a minute\\nto three minutes of rest.\\nSo this might be five sets of push-ups,\\ndone getting your maximum push-ups\\nalthough for some people\\nthat might be zero\\nand you have to do it knees down.\\nFor some people it might be 10 push-ups,\\nfor some people might be 25,\\nbut you could go all the way up to 100.\\nRest anywhere from 30 to 180 seconds,\\nand then do your next set\\nfor a total of three to five sets.\\nSo it doesn't actually\\nsound like a ton of work.\\nThe other thing you could do\\nis something like a plank.\\nA plank position is actually a way\\nto build muscular endurance, not strength.\\nOkay?\\nI'm sure it could be\\nused to develop strength,\\nbut it's really about muscular endurance.\\nSo you would do three\\nto five sets of planks.\\nThose planks would probably even\\nbecause you're not doing repetitions,\\nit's an isometric hold as we say,\\nas kind of static hold or a wall sit\\nwould be another example.\\nAnd you would do that probably\\nfor a minute or two minutes,\\ntake some rest of anywhere\\nfrom 30, 60, or 180 seconds,\\nand then repeat.\\nSo things like pushing a sled, push-ups,\\nisometric planks, even pull-ups,\\nthose will all work.\\nAnd as with others forms of training,\\nyou would want to do this,\\nuntil you approach\\nfailure or actually fail\\nand where you're unable to\\nperform another repetition\\nthat would mark the end of a set.\\nThe one critical feature of\\nbuilding muscular endurance\\nis that it has no major east\\ncentric loading component.\\nNow, I haven't talked much about eccentric\\nand concentric loading.\\nBut concentric loading is\\nwhen you are shortening\\nthe muscle typically or lifting a weight.\\nAnd east centric movements\\nare when you are lengthening\\na muscle typically\\nor lowering a weight.\\nSo if you do a pull up and\\nyou get your chin over the bar\\nor a chin up, that's the\\nconcentric portion of the effort,\\nand then as you lower yourself,\\nthat's the eccentric portion.\\nEccentric portion of resistance\\ntraining of any kind,\\nwhether or not it's for\\nendurance or for strength\\nis one of the major causes of soreness.\\nSome people will be more\\nsusceptible to this,\\nexcuse me than others,\\nbut it does create more\\ndamage in muscle fibers.\\nMuscular endurance and\\nbuilding muscular endurance\\nshould not include any movements\\nthat include major eccentric loads.\\nSo if you're going to do push-ups,\\nit doesn't mean that you want to drop,\\nyou know, smash your chest into the floor.\\nAnd by the way your chest\\nshould touch the ground\\non every push-up.\\nThat's a real push-up.\\nOkay?\\nIt's not about breaking\\n90 with the elbows,\\nit's about pushing down until\\nyour chest touch the floor\\nand straightening out.\\nThat's a proper push-up.\\nAnd a pull-up is where you pull\\nup your chin above the bar.\\nNeither of those should\\ninclude a slow eccentric\\nor lowering component.\\nIf you are using those to\\ntrain muscular endurance\\nthe three to five sets of 12 to 25\\nand maybe even up to 100 repetitions\\nwith 3,280 seconds of rest in between.\\nThat means that jumping also\\nis going to be a very poor tool\\nfor building muscular endurance,\\nbecause jumping has a slowing\\ndown component as you land.\\nSo things like plyometrics or agility work\\nwhere you're moving from side to side,\\nand you're decelerating,\\nyou're slowing yourself down a lot,\\nnot going to be good\\nfor muscular endurance.\\nTerrific for cardiovascular training\\nand conditioning of other\\nkinds and skill training\\nand agility and all that.\\nBut if you want to build\\nmuscular endurance,\\nyou want to make your muscles\\nable to do more work for longer.\\nIt's going to be this three to five sets\\nof 12 to 100 reps,\\n30 to 180 seconds of\\nmainly concentric movement.\\nOkay?\\nNot a slow lowering phase\\nor a heavy lowering phase.\\nSo that might be kettlebell\\nswings and things of that sort.\\nIsometrics, as I mentioned,\\nthings like planks\\nand wall sets will work.\\nNow, what's interesting\\nabout this is that,\\nit doesn't seem at all\\nlike what people normally\\nthink of as endurance.\\nAnd yet it's been shown in nice, quality\\npeer-reviewed studies,\\nseveral of which are cited in the review\\nI mentioned earlier,\\nthat muscular endurance\\ncan improve our ability\\nto engage in long bouts of\\nwhat we call long duration,\\nlow-intensity endurance work.\\nSo this can support long runs.\\nIt can support long swims.\\nAnd it can build also...\\nIt can build postural strength\\nand endurance simultaneously\\nand that's mainly accomplished\\nthrough isometrical.\\nSo things like planks\\nare actually quite good\\nfor building endurance of\\nthe spinal erector muscles\\nthat provide posture of\\nthe abdominal muscles\\nthat are helpful for\\nposture for being upright\\nfor the upper neck muscles\\nand things of that sort.\\nThese days everyone\\nseems to have texts neck.\\nEveryone is basically staring\\nat their toes all the time\\nas a default towards their toes.\\nSo isometric holds can be very good\\nfor building muscular endurance.\\nYou can spot people including yourself,\\nperhaps with poor muscular\\nendurance in the postural muscles\\nbecause anytime they stop moving,\\nthey have to lean against a wall\\nor their hip will move to one side,\\nor they're always leaned to one side.\\nI am guilty of this too.\\nSome of you have actually pointed out.\\nI like to think out of concern\\nthat I often am rubbing my lower back.\\nAnd indeed I have some\\nasymmetries of my postural muscles\\nsome of which are probably genetic\\nand some of which are probably\\njust from excessive work\\nor something of that sort\\nthat have my right shoulder\\nset lower than my left\\nand things of that sort.\\nIf I wanted to improve those,\\nI could improve those by\\nreally focusing on symmetry\\nand isometric.\\nSymmetry meaning holding my\\nhands at equivalent positions\\nin planks and doing isometric holds\\nfor building muscular endurance\\nof the postural muscles.\\nBut this can also be done with,\\nas I mentioned, kettlebell\\nswings for the lower back\\nand legs and posterior chain.\\nSo there are a number\\nof different exercises\\nyou could do this with,\\nbut it should be compound\\nexercises mainly.\\nIt's rare for people to do\\nthis kind of muscular endurance\\nwork specifically for things\\nlike bicep curls or triceps.\\nAnd there aren't many activities\\nthat really rely on\\nisolation of those muscles\\nand repeatedly, right?\\nIt's hard...\\nI'm sure there are some out there,\\nbut it's kind of hard to imagine.\\nSo you can do this with isometrics,\\nyou can do this with more standard\\nnon-isometric type movements,\\nbut make sure there isn't\\na strong eccentric load.\\nSo now let's talk about\\nthe science briefly\\nof why this works?\\nWell, that takes us back to\\nthis issue of fuel utilization\\nand what fails?\\nSo if we would say, okay,\\nlet's say you do a plank\\nand you're planking for,\\nyou know, maybe you're\\nable to plank for a minute\\nor two minutes or three minutes.\\nAt some point you will fail.\\nYou're not going to fail\\nbecause the heart gives out.\\nYou're not going to fail because\\nyou can't get enough oxygen\\nbecause you can breathe\\nwhile you're doing that.\\nYou're going to fail because\\nof local muscular failure.\\nWhich means that as you do,\\nif you choose to do this\\nprotocol of three to five sets,\\net cetera, et cetera, to\\nbuild muscular endurance,\\nmainly what you are going to be building\\nis you're going to be building the ability\\nof your mitochondria to use oxygen\\nto generate energy locally.\\nAnd that is something called\\nmitochondrial respiration.\\nRespiration because of\\nthe involvement of oxygen.\\nAnd it's also going to\\nbe increasing the extent\\nto which the neurons control the muscles\\nand provide a stimulus for\\nthe muscles to contract.\\nBut this is independent\\nof power and strength.\\nOkay?\\nSo even though the low sets\\nlike three to five sets\\nand the fact that you're doing repetitions\\nand you're going to failure,\\neven though it seems to\\nresemble power and strength\\nand hypertrophy type training,\\nit is distinctly different.\\nIt's not going to generate\\nstrength, hypertrophy and power.\\nIt's going to mainly create\\nthis ability to endure\\nto continually contract muscles\\nor repeatedly contract muscles.\\nOkay?\\nContinually if you're\\nusing isometric holds,\\nrepeatedly, excuse me,\\nif you're using repetition type exercise\\nwhere there's a contraction\\nand an extension the muscle\\nessentially concentric\\nand an eccentric portion.\\nBut remember that you want the\\neccentric portion to be light\\nand relatively fast,\\nnot so fast that you injure yourself,\\nbut certainly not\\ndeliberately slowed down.\\nIt was recommended, I\\nshould say by Andy Galpin\\nthat you not use Olympic lifts for this,\\nbecause once you get past\\neight or 12 or 25 repetitions,\\nespecially form on those\\nOlympic lifts is key\\nfor not getting injured.\\nAnd while some people can\\nperform those sorts of of lifts\\nlikes snatches and deadlifts\\nand cleans and jerks\\nand overhead presses,\\nprobably not a great idea if\\nthe goal is to push the body\\nto points of fatigue,\\nbecause you do open yourself up to injury,\\nunless you're very skilled at doing that,\\nor you have a really good coach\\nwho can help you guide\\nthrough those lifts.\\nSo that's one form of endurance\\nwhich is muscular endurance.\\nAnd it's mainly going to\\nrely on neural energy.\\nSo nerves and muscle.\\nAnd it's not going to rely quite so much\\non what's available in your\\nblood, your heart or your lungs.\\nSo now let's talk about the\\nother extreme of endurance\\nwhich is long duration endurance.\\nThis is the type that\\npeople typically think about\\nwhen they think about endurance.\\nYou're talking about a\\nlong run, a long swim,\\na long bike ride.\\nWell, how long we'll\\nanywhere from 12 minutes\\nto several hours or\\nmaybe even an entire day,\\nmaybe eight or nine hours of\\nhiking or running or biking.\\nSome people are actually doing those kinds\\nof really long events\\nmarathons, for instance.\\nSo anything longer than 12 minutes.\\nAnd this type of work\\nbuilds on fuel utilization\\nin the muscles,\\nit builds on the activity\\nof neurons in the brain\\nthat are involved in what we call\\ncentral pattern generators.\\nWe talked about this in a previous episode\\nor several previous episodes.\\nThese are groups of\\nneurons that allow our body\\nto engage in regular rhythmic effort\\nwithout having to think\\nabout the movement too much.\\nSo running and stepping or swimming\\nif you already know how to swim,\\nor peddling on a bike or\\nwalking upstairs and hiking,\\nyou're not thinking about\\nright, left, right, left.\\nIt's all carried out by\\ncentral pattern generators.\\nThis is going to be at\\nless than a hundred percent\\nof your maximum oxygen uptake,\\nyour VO2 max, I'll talk\\nabout what VO2 max is.\\nBut I just want to give a\\nsense of what the protocol is,\\nand the underlying science.\\nHow many sets?\\nOne.\\nLong duration effort is one\\nset of 12 minutes or longer.\\nSo you're not counting repetitions.\\nI sure hope that if you're\\ngoing out on a 30 minute run\\nor even a 15 minute run,\\nthat you're not counting steps,\\nthat you're not counting pedal strokes,\\nthat you're not on the rower\\ncounting poles on the rower.\\nI suppose you could,\\nbut I think that would be pretty dreadful.\\nSeems like a poor utilization\\nof cognitive brain space.\\nYou're getting into\\nregular repeated effort\\nand your ability to continue that effort\\nis going to be dependent\\nmainly on the efficiency\\nof the movement on your\\nability to strike a balance\\nbetween the movement itself,\\nthe generation of the muscular\\nmovements that are required,\\nand fuel utilization across\\nthe different sources\\nof nerve muscle, blood, heart and lungs.\\nSo let's ask the question.\\nWhy would you fail on a long run?\\nWhy would you quit?\\nWell, as you set out on that long run,\\nassuming you have some\\nglycogen in your liver\\nand in your muscles, you're\\ngoing to use that energy first,\\neven if it's very low intensity.\\nI guess we're not talking about sprinting,\\nwe're talking about heading out the door\\nor starting off on a marathon.\\nYou're starting to assuming\\nyou have some conditioning\\nor even if you don't,\\nyou're going to burn carbohydrate.\\nYou're going to burn\\nglucose in the bloodstream,\\nyou're going to burn carbohydrate\\nas those muscles contract.\\nThose what we call slow twitch muscles.\\nThey're contracting,\\nthey start burning up fuel to make ATP\\nto continue to contract.\\nYour mind is going to\\nuse more or less energy\\ndepending on how much willpower,\\nhow much of a fight you have\\nto get into with yourself\\nin order to generate the effort.\\nI really want to underscore this.\\nIf you're somebody that's thinking,\\nmaybe I go for the run,\\nmaybe I don't go for the run.\\nI'll do it at two o'clock.\\nOkay, 2:05.\\nNo, I only want to go on the half hour\\nor maybe on the main hour.\\nAnd you're going through all that.\\nGuess what?\\nYou're burning up useful energy\\nthat you could use either\\nfor the run, for example,\\nor for something else.\\nWhen we think about something hard,\\nwhen we ruminate,\\nwhen we perseverate on\\nan idea or on a decision,\\nwe are burning neural\\nenergy and neural energy\\nis glucose and epinephrin\\nand all the things\\nwe talked about before.\\nSo willpower in part is the ability\\nto devote resources to things\\nand part of that is making decisions\\nto just either do it or not do it.\\nI'm not of the just do it mindset.\\nI think there's a right\\ntime and a place to train.\\nBut I also think that it is not good.\\nIn other words, it utilizes\\nexcessive resources\\nto churn over decisions excessively,\\nand you probably burn\\nas much cognitive energy\\ndeciding about whether or not\\nto do a given training or not\\nas you do in the actual training.\\nOkay?\\nSo we'll talk more about how\\nthis long duration effort\\ncan relate to mental performance,\\nbut the long duration\\neffort should be one set,\\n12 minutes or longer.\\nIt could go for 30 minutes\\nor 60 minutes or an hour.\\nWe'll talk about programming\\nlater in the episode.\\nThis is going to be less\\nthan a hundred percent\\nof your maximum oxygen uptake.\\nYour heart rate is not going\\nto be through the ceiling\\nor maxed out.\\nBut it's all about efficiency of movement.\\nThat's what you're building.\\nWhen you go out for a\\nrun that's 30 minutes,\\nyou are building the capacity\\nto repeat that performance.\\nThe next time, while being more efficient\\nactually burning less fuel.\\nAnd that might seem a\\nlittle bit counterintuitive,\\nbut every time you do that run,\\nwhat you're doing is you're building up\\nmitochondrial density.\\nIt's not so much about\\nmitochondrial oxidation\\nand respiration.\\nYou're building up mitochondrial density.\\nYou're actually increasing\\nthe amount of ATP\\nthat you can create for\\na given about of effort.\\nYou're becoming more efficient.\\nOkay?\\nYou're burning less fuel\\noverall doing the same thing.\\nThat's really what\\nthese long slow distance\\nor long bouts of effort\\nare really all about.\\nNow, why do this long duration effort?\\nWhy would you want to do it?\\nWhy is it good for you?\\nWell, it does something very important\\nwhich is that it builds the\\ncapillary beds within muscles.\\nSo let's talk a little\\nbit about vasculature.\\nWe haven't done this too much yet,\\nbut if you have seen the episode\\non supercharging performance.\\nWe talked about these AVAs\\narteriovenous anastomosis\\nwhere blood moves from\\narteries directly into veins,\\nbut that's unusual,\\nthat only takes place in\\nthe so-called glabrous skin\\nof the palms, the face and\\nthe bottoms of the feet.\\nTypically, for most all\\nother areas of the body\\nwhat happens is,\\narteries bring blood to a\\ngiven tissue like a muscle,\\nand veins return that\\nblood back to the heart.\\nThere are exceptions, but in general.\\nAnd in between arteries and\\nveins are these little tiny\\nwhat are called capillary\\nbeds or microcapillaries.\\nSo these are tiny little avenues,\\nlike little tiny streams and estuaries\\nbetween the bigger arteries and veins.\\nNow, those are actually\\ncontained within muscle.\\nAnd what's amazing is\\nthat you can increase\\nthe number of them.\\nYou can literally build new capillaries.\\nYou can create new little\\nstreams within your muscles\\nand the type of long duration effort\\nthat I was talking about\\nbefore to 12 minutes or more\\nof steady effort is very\\nuseful for doing that,\\nand is very useful for\\nincreasing the mitochondria,\\nthe energy producing\\nelements of the cells,\\nthe actual muscle cells.\\nAnd the reason is when\\nblood arrives to muscles\\nit has oxygen.\\nThe muscles are going to\\nuse some of that oxygen.\\nAnd then some of the deoxygenated blood\\nis going to be sent back to\\nthe heart and to the lungs.\\nNow, the more capillaries that\\nyou build into those muscles,\\nthe more oxygen available\\nto those muscles.\\nI don't want to get too much\\ninto the physics of fluid flow.\\nBut basically it's the\\ndifference between taking a hose\\nand sticking it into some\\ndirt just directly like\\nand turning on the faucet at a given rate,\\nthe spigot rather,\\nor having a bunch of little hoses\\nlike a sprinkler system that go out\\nand irrigate the whole yard.\\nThe irrigation is equivalent\\nto this capillary bed system.\\nAnd it's very good at using\\nenergy sources within blood.\\nSo the simple way to think about this is,\\nwhen you go out for a run,\\nlet's say it's the first\\nrun you've done for a while,\\nand you out for 12 or 15 minutes\\nand somewhere right around 20 minutes\\nyou're like, that's it.\\nI just can't continue.\\nWell, when you come back the\\nnext time to do that run,\\nyou've built endurance largely\\nbecause you've built these capillary beds.\\nYou've expanded these little streams\\nin which blood can deliver\\noxygen to the muscles.\\nAnd so it's going to feel\\nrelatively straightforward\\nto either go a little bit\\nquicker for the same duration,\\nthe same distance.\\nOr to extend that run for\\nanother five to 10 minutes.\\nSo this long duration work,\\nunlike muscular endurance like planks\\nand everything that we\\nwere talking about before\\nis really about building\\nthe capillary systems\\nand the mitochondria,\\nthe energy utilization systems\\nwithin the muscles themselves.\\nAnd that's very important to understand.\\nIt's distinctly different\\nthan say building the neurons\\nthat fire the muscles.\\nThe neurons are already there,\\nthey're going to fire\\nthose muscles just fine.\\nIn fact, if your life depended on it,\\ntoday you could probably run a marathon.\\nYou'd probably get injured,\\nit would be very psychologically\\nand physically painful.\\nI don't recommend you do that\\nunless you're trained for it.\\nBut if you were to train properly for it,\\nif you were to do long\\nduration bouts of effort\\nonce or twice a week or three times a week\\npretty soon it would become easy,\\nbecause you're building\\nthese vascular micro beds\\nor microvascular beds as they're called.\\nOkay?\\nSo you're able to bring\\nmore energy to the muscles\\nand they're able to utilize more energy.\\nSo that's long duration.\\nSo we've got muscular endurance\\nand we've got long duration endurance.\\nAnd then there are two kinds in between\\nthat in recent years have\\ngotten a lot of attention\\nand excitement,\\nbut most people are not distinguishing\\nbetween these two kinds of endurance.\\nAnd that's a shame because\\nin failing to distinguish\\nbetween the two kinds of what we call\\nhigh-intensity training,\\nsometimes called high\\nintensity interval training.\\nMost people, perhaps you,\\nare not getting nearly as much physical\\nand mental benefit out of\\nhigh intensity training\\nas you could.\\nSo I want to talk about the two kinds\\nof high-intensity interval training,\\nand what each of them does\\nfor your brain and body,\\nand what sorts of adaptations they cause?\\nBecause in doing that,\\nyou can really start to build\\nup specific energy systems\\nin your brain and body in\\nways that are best serve you\\nfor your cognitive work.\\nAnd for other sorts of things\\nlike strength and speed\\nor hypertrophy or for running\\nmarathons for that matter.\\nSo there are two kinds of\\nhigh intensity training\\nfor endurance.\\nSometimes called high-intensity\\ninterval training.\\nOne, is anaerobic, so-called\\nan aerobic endurance,\\nso no oxygen.\\nAnd the other is aerobic endurance.\\nBoth of which qualify as HIIT,\\nhigh intensity interval training.\\nSo let's talk about\\nanaerobic endurance first.\\nAnaerobic endurance from\\na protocol perspective\\nis going to be three to 12 sets.\\nOkay?\\nAnd these records and I'll talk about\\nwhat the repetitions are,\\nare going to be performed\\nat whatever speed allows you\\nto complete the work in good, safe form.\\nOkay?\\nSo it could be fast, it could be slow\\nas the work continues,\\nyour repetitions may slow down,\\nor it may speed up.\\nChances are it's going to slow down.\\nSo what does this work?\\nWhat are the sets look like?\\nRemember long slow distance is one set.\\nMuscular endurance is three to five sets.\\nHigh-intensity anaerobic endurance\\nis going to be somewhere\\nbetween three and 12 sets.\\nAnd it's going to have\\na ratio of work to rest\\nof anywhere from three\\nto one to one to five.\\nOkay?\\nSo what would a three to\\none ratio set look like?\\nWell, it's going to be 30\\nseconds of hard pedaling\\non the bike, for instance,\\nor running or on the rower.\\nThese are just examples.\\nIt could be in the pool, swimming.\\nIt could be any number\\nof things or air squats,\\nor weighted squats if you will\\nprovided you can manage that.\\n30 seconds on, 10 seconds off.\\nThat's a very brief rest.\\nSo three to one is just a good example\\nwould be 30 seconds on 10 seconds off.\\nThe opposite extreme on\\nthat ratio be one to five.\\nSo 20 seconds on a hundred seconds off.\\nSo you do the work for 20 seconds\\nthen you rest a hundred seconds.\\nNow, what's the difference?\\nWhat should you do three one ratio?\\nSo 30 seconds on 10 seconds off,\\nor should you do one to five,\\n20 seconds on to 100 seconds off?\\nWell, that will depend on\\nwhether or not the quality\\nof the movement is important to you.\\nSo let's just take a look\\nat the three to one ratio.\\nSo in the three to one ratio,\\nif you're going to do 30\\nseconds of hard peddling\\non a bike followed by 10 seconds.\\nSo maybe one of these what\\nthey call assault bikes,\\nand then you stop for 10\\nseconds and then repeat,\\nchances are you will\\nbe able to do one, two,\\nthree, four, maybe even\\nas many as 12 sets,\\nif you're really in good condition\\nthat you'll be able to do all those\\nbecause pedaling on the bike\\ndoesn't require a ton of skill.\\nAnd if you do it incorrectly,\\nif your elbow flares out\\na little bit or something,\\nit's very unlikely that you'll get injured\\nunless it's really extreme.\\nOkay?\\nBut the same movement done for\\ninstance, with kettlebells.\\nSo 30 seconds on 10 seconds off.\\nThe first set will\\nprobably be in good form.\\nThe second one will be\\nin pretty good form,\\nbut let's say you're getting\\nto the fifth and sixth set\\nand you're going 30\\nseconds on 10 seconds off\\nchances are the quality\\nof your repetitions\\nwill degrade significantly.\\nAnd you increase the probability\\nthat you're going to get injured,\\nor that you're going\\nto damage in some way,\\nor that you can't complete the movement\\nor that some smaller muscles\\nlike your grip muscles\\nmight give out.\\nOkay?\\nSo the quality of repetitions\\nis going to drop considerably\\nwith the three to one approach.\\nIf you're just doing it for effort.\\nAnd we'll talk about what\\nthis builds in your system\\nin a moment, that's fine.\\nBut for most people, if\\nquality of form is important,\\nso maybe this is using weights,\\nmaybe you're doing squats.\\nYou're going to do 20 seconds\\non and 100 seconds of rest.\\nMaybe it's even a barbell loaded squat,\\nmaybe you're doing kettlebells,\\nmaybe you've got some\\nother resistance there\\nthat's allowing you to do this.\\nWhat you'll find is that the longer rest,\\neven though it's 20\\nseconds of intense effort,\\nfollowed by a longer rest\\nof about a hundred seconds\\nwill allow you to perform\\nmore quality repetitions\\nsafely over time.\\nSo what does building\\nanaerobic endurance look like?\\nAnd then I'll tell you what\\nit's actually good for,\\nin the true practical sense.\\nWhat anaerobic endurance\\nexercise generally looks like\\nis that if you decide to\\ndo this for the first week,\\nyou might do this two\\nor three times a week,\\nmaybe even just once a week,\\ndepending on the other\\nthings you're doing,\\nwe'll talk about programming at the end.\\nAnd you would generate just three sets.\\nSo it might be three sets of\\n20 seconds of hard effort,\\nfollowed by 100 seconds rest.\\nThen you repeat 20 seconds of hard effort,\\n100 seconds rest, 20 seconds\\nof effort, 100 seconds rest,\\nand you might do that twice a week.\\nAnd then each week you're\\nadding one or two sets, okay?\\nIn doing that, you will\\nbuild up what we call\\nanaerobic endurance.\\nWhat is anaerobic endurance?\\nWell, let's ask why we fail?\\nAnaerobic endurance is going\\nto be taking your system\\ninto greater than 100% of your VO2 max.\\nIt's going to be taking\\nyour heart rate up very high\\nand it's going to maximize your\\noxygen utilization systems.\\nThat is going to have effects\\nthat are going to lead\\nto fatigue at some point\\nin the workout.\\nAnd that fatigue will\\ntrigger an adaptation.\\nSo let's ask what\\nadaptation it's triggering.\\nWell, it's triggering both\\nmitochondrial respiration,\\nthe ability of your mitochondria\\nto generate more energy\\nby using more oxygen because\\nyou're bringing so...\\nYou're maxing out,\\nliterally you're getting\\nabove your VO2 max.\\nYou're hitting that\\nthreshold of how much oxygen\\nyou can use in your system?\\nOne of the adaptations will\\nbe that your mitochondria\\nwill shift such that\\nthey can use more oxygen.\\nAnd you're going to also\\nincrease the capillary beds,\\nbut not as much as you're going to be able\\nto increase the amount of\\nneuron engagement of muscle.\\nSo normally when we start to hit fatigue,\\nwhen we're exhausted,\\nwhen we're breathing really hard\\nbecause the systems of the body are linked\\nand we there's a\\ncomponent to this as well,\\na kind of motivational component.\\nAfter that third or\\nfourth or sixth set of,\\nyou know, 20 seconds on\\na hundred seconds off,\\nor if you're at the other\\nextreme 30 seconds on,\\nand 10 seconds off.\\nThere's going to be a\\ncomponent of you want to stop.\\nAnd by pushing through and\\nrepeating another set safely,\\nof course.\\nWhat you're doing is\\nyou're training the neurons\\nto be able to access\\nmore energy, literally,\\nconvert that into ATP and for the muscles\\ntherefore to access more energy and ATP.\\nAnd the adaptation is in\\nthe mitochondria's ability\\nto use oxygen,\\nand this has tremendous carry over effects\\nfor other types of exercise.\\nSo while I know and appreciate\\nthat people are using high\\nintensity interval training\\nof this kind or similar in\\norder to just like burn fat,\\nyou know, do their\\nworkouts, quote unquote.\\nIt's very useful for\\nbuilding a capacity to engage\\nin short bouts of effort\\nrepeatedly to really lock in.\\nI don't want to use the word focus\\nbecause it's not strictly mental focus,\\nbut to be able to generate\\nshort bouts of very intense work\\nthis can be beneficial\\nin competitive sports\\nor team sports where there's\\na sprinting component,\\nwhere the field opens up\\nand you need to dribble\\nthe ball down the field, for\\ninstance and shoot on goal.\\nOr where you're playing tennis,\\nand it's a long rally.\\nAnd then all of a sudden,\\nsomebody really starts,\\nyou know, putting you back on your heels\\nand you have to really make\\nthe maximum amount of effort\\nto run to the net and to\\nget the ball across in that.\\nThings of that sort.\\nOkay?\\nThere are a variety of places\\nwhere there's carry over\\nfrom this type of training,\\nbut it does support endurance.\\nIt's about muscle endurance.\\nIt's about these muscles ability\\nto generate a lot of force\\nin the short-term, but repeatedly.\\nOkay?\\nSo that's the way to conceptualize this.\\nAnd it is different than maximum power.\\nEven though it feels like maximum effort,\\nit is not the same as building\\npower and speed into muscles.\\nThose are distinctly different protocols.\\nSo the key elements again\\nare that you're bringing your breathing\\nand your oxygen utilization\\nway up above your max.\\nIt's not quite hitting failure,\\nbut you're really pushing the system\\nto the point where you are\\nnot ready to do another set\\nand yet you begin another set.\\nYou're not necessarily\\npsychologically ready.\\nI'll talk more about\\nsome of the adaptations\\nthat this causes in terms of\\nstroke volume in a few minutes\\nwhen we talk about how it\\nis that work of this sort\\ncan increase our heart's ability\\nto deliver blood and oxygen\\nto our lungs and other tissues.\\nI'm going to get very\\nspecific about how to breathe\\nduring these different types of protocols\\nand what's happening at\\nthe level of the heart?\\nBut I want to make sure I\\ntouch on the fourth protocol\\nwhich is high intensity\\naerobic conditioning.\\nSo HIIT has these two forms,\\nanaerobic and aerobic.\\nAnd you just heard about anaerobic.\\nHigh-intensity aerobic conditioning\\nalso involves about three to 12 sets.\\nStarting off of course, with fewer sets\\nas you're getting into this training\\nand then extending into more sets\\nas one parameter you could expand.\\nHas again the same ratio of three to one.\\nSo 30 seconds on 10 seconds off,\\nor one to five, 20 seconds\\non 100 seconds off,\\nor a very powerful tool for\\nbuilding up aerobic conditioning\\nis a one-to-one ratio.\\nA one-to-one ratio is powerful\\nfor building on average.\\nMost of the energy systems involving,\\nremember we had these nerve\\nmuscle blood, heart and lungs.\\nA one-to-one ratio\\nmight be you run a mile.\\nAnd however long that takes,\\nlet's say it takes you six\\nminutes or seven minutes,\\nthen you rest for an\\nequivalent amount of time.\\nThen you repeat.\\nAnd then you rest for an\\nequivalent amount of time.\\nSo you might run first mile\\nis let's say seven minutes.\\nThen you rest for seven minutes.\\nThen you run a mile again,\\nand it might take eight minutes\\nand you rest for eight minutes.\\nAnd you continue that for a\\ntotal of four miles of work.\\nFour miles of running work, I should say.\\nOr seven miles of work.\\nYou can build this up.\\nMany people find that\\nusing this type of training\\nallows them to do things\\nlike go run half marathons\\nand marathons even though\\nprior to the race date,\\nthey've never actually run\\na half marathon or marathon.\\nNow, that might seem incredible.\\nIt's like how could it be\\nthat running a mile on,\\nand then resting for running a mile\\nand then resting for an\\nequivalent amount of time,\\nrunning a mile, resting\\nfor equivalent amount time\\nfor seven miles allows\\nyou to run continuously\\nfor 13 miles or for 26 miles.\\nWell, I'm not discouraging people\\nfrom ever doing the\\nlong duration endurance.\\nI think that is very important.\\nBut it's because it builds\\nup so many of these energy\\nutilization systems.\\nIt really teaches you\\nto engage, excuse me,\\nthe nerve to muscle firing.\\nIt improves ATP and\\nmitochondrial function in muscle.\\nIt allows the blood to deliver more oxygen\\nto the muscle and to your brain.\\nAnd I'll explain how that is.\\nAnd it allows your heart to\\ndeliver more oxygen overall.\\nAnd it builds a tremendous lung capacity.\\nAnd we will talk about\\nexactly how to breathe\\nand how to build lung capacity.\\nBoth for sake of warming\\nup and for performance.\\nSo what would this look like?\\nAnd when should you do this?\\nWell, it's really a\\nquestion for these workouts\\nof asking how much work can\\none do in eight to 12 minutes,\\nright?\\nAnd then rest, and then repeat.\\nHow much work can you do\\nfor eight to 12 minutes\\nthen rest and then repeat?\\nAnd how many times should you do this?\\nWell, this is the sort of\\nthing it's pretty intense.\\nAnd so you would probably\\nonly want to do this two,\\nmaybe three times a week\\nif you're not doing many other things.\\nI will talk about how this program\\ncan be moved in with\\nother forms of training.\\nBut I'll just give you a little hint now.\\nIt's very clear and it's\\ndescribed in the review article\\nare referred to and we will\\nlink another article as well.\\nThat concurrent training,\\ndoing strength training\\nand the endurance training\\nof any of the four kinds\\nthat I'm describing today can be done.\\nYou can program those in the same week.\\nBut you want to get four and ideally six\\nor even better 24 hours\\nbetween these workouts.\\nBecause it is very hard, for instance,\\nto do a one-to-one mile repeats\\nlike run a mile rest for equivalent time,\\nrun a mile rest for equivalent time\\nto do that two or three times a week,\\nand also do weight training before\\nor do a long run afterwards.\\nThat would quickly lead to\\nbreak down for most people,\\nunless you have very, very good\\nenergy utilization systems.\\nYou're really kind of\\nadvanced or elite athlete,\\nand or dare I say you're using tools\\nto enhance your performance\\nat the level of blood\\nor hormones.\\nAnd I'm actually going to\\ntalk about those at the end\\nand why they work?\\nSo we have four kinds of endurance.\\nMuscular endurance.\\nWe have long-duration endurance.\\nWe have high intensity\\ninterval training of two kinds,\\nanaerobic and aerobic.\\nAnd this last type, the\\naerobic one works best.\\nIt seems if you kind of\\ndo this one-to-one ratio.\\nSo how would you use these and\\nwhat are they actually doing?\\nLet's talk about the heart\\nand the lungs and oxygen,\\nbecause that's something\\nthat we can all benefit\\nfrom understanding.\\nAnd it will become very\\nclear in that discussion\\nwhy this type of training is very useful\\neven for non-athletes in\\norder to improve oxygenation\\nand energy utilization of\\nthe brain and the heart.\\nThe brain and the heart are probably\\nthe two most important systems\\nthat you need to take\\ncare of in your life.\\nYes, your musculature\\nneeds to be maintained.\\nIf you want to build it, that's up to you.\\nBut you should try and\\nmaintain your musculature,\\nbut maintaining or\\nenhancing a brain function\\nand cardiovascular function.\\nIt's absolutely clear are\\nkey for health and longevity\\nin the short and long-term.\\nAnd the sorts of training\\nI talked about today\\nhas been shown again and again and again\\nto be very useful for enhancing\\nthe strength of the mind.\\nYes, I'll talk about that.\\nAs well as the health of\\nthe brain and the body.\\nSo let's talk about the\\nsorts of adaptations\\nthat are happening in your brain and body\\nthat are so beneficial in these\\ndifferent forms of training.\\nIf you are breathing hard and\\nyour heart is beating hard.\\nSo this would be certainly\\nin the high intensity\\nanaerobic and aerobic conditioning.\\n'Cause you're getting up near your VO2 max\\nin high intensity aerobic conditioning,\\nand you're exceeding your\\nVO2 max in high intensity\\nanaerobic conditioning.\\nWhat's going to happen is as of course,\\nyour heart beats faster,\\nyour blood is going to be\\ncirculating faster in principle.\\nOxygen utilization in\\nmuscles is going to go up\\nand over time, not long,\\nvery quickly what will happen\\nwhen those capillary beds start to expand?\\nWe talked about that.\\nBut in addition, because\\nof the amount of blood\\nthat's being returned to the heart,\\nwhen you engage in these\\nreally intense bouts\\nof effort repeatedly,\\nthe amount of blood being\\nreturned to the heart\\nactually causes an east centric loading\\nof one of the muscular walls of the heart.\\nSo your heart is muscle.\\nIt's cardiac muscle.\\nWe have skeletal muscle\\nattached to our bones\\nand we have cardiac\\nmuscle, which is our heart.\\nWhen more blood is being\\nreturned to the heart\\nbecause of the additional\\nwork that your muscles\\nand nerves are doing,\\nit actually has the effect of creating\\nan east centric loading, a\\nkind of pushing of the wall,\\nthe left wall.\\nI realize I'm not using\\nthe strict anatomy here,\\nbut I don't want to get\\ninto all the features\\nof the structural features of the heart.\\nBut the left ventricle\\nessentially getting slammed back\\nand then having to push back\\nin a kind of east centric\\nloading of the cardiac muscle\\nand the muscle thickens,\\nbut not because the\\nheart thickens overall,\\nit's actually a strengthening\\nof the cardiac muscle\\nin a way that increases\\nwhat we call stroke volume.\\nMeaning as more blood is\\nreturned to the heart.\\nThere's an adaptation\\nwhere the heart muscle\\nactually gets stronger and\\ntherefore can pump more blood\\nper stroke per beat.\\nAnd as it does that, it delivers\\nbecause blood contains glucose\\nand oxygen and other things.\\nIt delivers more fuel to your muscles\\nwhich allows you to do yet\\nmore work per unit time.\\nOkay?\\nSo when we hear that,\\noh, you know, so-and-so\\nhas a or maybe you have\\na nice low heart rate\\nthat maybe you're one of\\nthese really extreme folks\\nlike 30 or 40 beats per minute,\\nalthough most people are\\nsitting at 50, 60, 70, 80,\\nthat's your resting heart rate.\\nIf you exercise regularly\\nand you do long duration aerobic work,\\nyour heart rate will start to go down,\\nyour resting heart rate.\\nIt will increase the stroke\\nvolume of your heart.\\nIf you do this high\\nintensity type training\\nwhere your heart is beating very hard.\\nSo maybe the one-to-one\\nratio mile run repeats\\nthat I described a minute ago.\\nLet's say you do that twice\\na week for three or four.\\nAnd I said, it could go all\\nthe way up to 12 rep sets,\\nwhich is a lot.\\nI don't recommend people start there.\\nPretty soon, the stroke\\nvolume of your heart\\nwill really increase.\\nAnd as a consequence,\\nyou can deliver more fuel\\nto your muscles and to your brain,\\nand you will notice that\\nyou can do more work\\nmeaning you can do the same\\nwork you were doing a few days\\nor weeks ago with relative ease.\\nYour cognitive functioning will improve.\\nThis has been shown again and again,\\nbecause there's an\\nincrease in vasculature.\\nLiterally, capillary\\nbeds within the brain,\\nthe hippocampus areas that support memory,\\nbut also areas of the brain\\nthat support respiration,\\nthat support focus,\\nthat support effort.\\nThis isn't often discussed,\\nbut the ability to deliver more blood\\nand therefore more glucose,\\nremember neurons run on\\nglucose and oxygen to the brain\\nis a big feature of why\\nexercise of the kind\\nof describing helps with brain function.\\nNow, weight training does\\nhave some positive effects\\non brain function also.\\nWhen I say weight training, I'm really...\\nI should be more specific.\\nI really am referring to strength\\nand hypertrophy training.\\nStrength and hypertrophy training\\nespecially if it's of the sort\\nwhere you get into the burn\\nas we talked about last episode\\nand you start generating\\nlactate as a hormonal signal\\nthat can benefit your brain, et cetera.\\nIt can have positive effects on the brain.\\nAnd frankly, there haven't\\nbeen as many studies\\nof resistance training strength\\nand hypertrophy training\\non brain function,\\nmainly because most of those experiments\\nare done in mice or\\nprimates, non-human primates,\\nI should say.\\nAnd it's hard to get mice\\nto do resistance training.\\nOkay?\\nIt's hard to get humans\\nto do resistance training.\\nIt's definitely hard to get\\nmice to do resistance training.\\nThere are ways to do it,\\nbut it's hard to get\\nthem to do say, you know,\\nthree sets of eight on the\\ndeadlift and then do some curls\\nand then do some chin-ups\\nand this kind of thing.\\nOkay?\\nIt's pretty easy to get a\\nmouse to run on a treadmill\\nand you can set the\\ntension on that treadmill\\nto make it so that it's\\neasier or harder for the mouse\\nto turn that wheel.\\nSo that's one of the reasons.\\nHowever, it's very clear\\nand you should now understand intuitively\\nwhy the kind of standard\\nstrength and hypertrophy\\ntype workouts are not going to activate\\nthe blood oxygenation and\\nthe stroke volume increases\\nfor the heart that the sorts of training\\nI'm talking about today will.\\nIt just doesn't have the\\nsame positive effects.\\nNow, that isn't to say that\\nif you just weight train\\nthat you'll be dumb or that\\nyou'll lose your memory\\nover time, you might,\\nbut it is to say that endurance work\\nin particular the high intensity\\nand long duration work that\\nI've talked about today.\\nThe two high intensity protocols\\nand the long duration work has been shown\\nagain and again and again,\\nto have positive effects\\non brain function.\\nNot through the addition of new neurons,\\nsorry to break it to you,\\nbut that's not a major\\nevent in the exercised\\nor non-exercised human brain,\\nfor reasons we can talk\\nabout in a future episode.\\nBut it still has many positive effects\\nthrough the delivery of things like IGF-1,\\nbut also just through plain\\noxygenation of the brain\\nand the way it promotes the\\ndevelopment of microvasculature\\nto develop, to excuse me,\\nto deliver new neurons more nutrients.\\nIf neurons don't get oxygen\\nand glucose, they do die.\\nUnless there's another\\nfuel source like ketones\\nwhich can replace the glucose.\\nIf you don't give oxygen to neurons,\\nif you don't deliver enough to them,\\nyou get what's called ischemia,\\nyou get little micro strokes.\\nSo the type of exercise\\nI'm talking about today\\nin generating intense heart rate increases\\nprovided that safe for you to do.\\nBreathing hard,\\nthat's going to deliver oxygen in blood,\\nincrease stroke volume of the heart\\nand is going to improve brain function\\nhas been supported by many, many quality\\npeer-reviewed studies.\\nSo that's one form of positive adaptation.\\nI also talked about just sort\\nof performance adaptations.\\nHow doing high intensity\\naerobic conditioning\\nof the mile repeats type\\ntraining can actually\\nimprove your ability to do\\nlong bouts of intense work.\\nIt also seems like it dovetails\\nor is compatible with resistance training\\nthat's aimed towards\\nstrength and hypertrophy.\\nNow, in full disclosure\\nthe data seemed to indicate\\nthat if people just weight\\ntrain or train for strength,\\nso three reps, rest five minutes,\\nthree reps of heavyweights, et cetera.\\nYeah, you'll get much\\nstronger than you would\\nif you're doing things like\\nfive repetitions up to 12,\\nor 12 to 25 reps and you're\\ngoing out for long jogs.\\nThere's always going to be\\na compromise in adaptations,\\nunfortunately\\nIt does seem like you can\\ndo concurrent training\\nas I mentioned before,\\nif you allow anywhere\\nfrom four to six or ideally\\n24 hours between workouts.\\nAs I mentioned in the previous episode,\\nif you want to know if you\\nare recovered from a workout?\\nA great way to do that is to apply\\nthe carbon dioxide tolerance test,\\nwhich is four breaths in and out,\\ninhale, exhale, inhale exhale,\\ninhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,\\nthen a big inhale and then\\na slow controlled exhale.\\nIf that slow controlled exhale\\nis 60 seconds or longer,\\nit means that your parasympathetic,\\nyour calming nervous system\\nis under your control.\\nAnd it's likely, I should say likely\\nthat systemically your whole\\nnervous system has recovered\\nfrom whatever it is that you've been doing\\nand experiencing in life\\nincluding work in relationships.\\nIf not, you might want to\\ntake a rest day, dare I say.\\nOr Costello's on is what?\\nHe's 10 now.\\nI think he's on his 12,000 thrust day.\\nMost people need I should say,\\none to two full rest days per week.\\nI know there are people going to say\\nthat's ridiculous and okay,\\nmaybe you have amazing recovery abilities,\\nalso depends on training intensity.\\nMany people benefit from having one or two\\nfull rest days per week.\\nAt least one, some people don't need to.\\nBut if you are not able\\nto extend that exhale\\non the carbon dioxide tolerance\\ntest past 60 seconds or so,\\n45 seconds, 60 seconds chances are,\\nyour so-called sympathetic nervous system,\\nyour stress system is chronically elevated\\nand you're not really putting the brake\\non that system enough.\\nAnd that's a subconscious thing.\\nThere are ways that you\\ncan accelerate recovery,\\nbut I would encourage you to\\nlisten to the previous episode.\\nIt's time-stamped for\\nhow to assess recovery.\\nSo how often to program these things\\nwill depend on the other\\nthings you're doing.\\nI think it's perfectly reasonable\\nto do this type of training\\nwith other types of training.\\nAnd I'll talk about a variety\\nof combinations of those\\ntoward the end of the episode.\\nI do want to talk about\\nhow to deliver more energy\\nand oxygen.\\nThese are tools that are extremely useful,\\nI believe and that are\\ngrounded in physiology.\\nThat three things I'd like to talk about,\\nare how to breathe?\\nWhat to do immediately after\\ntraining and hydration?\\nAnd I promise I will get\\nback into programming\\nand sort of protocols,\\nbut these are vitally\\nimportant to your ability\\nto perform endurance work in particular.\\nAnd they are grounded\\nin how neurons and blood\\nand oxygen and your heart work together.\\nSo let's first talk about\\nbreathing or respiration.\\nWe breathe a couple of different ways,\\nbut let's just remind\\nourselves why we breathe?\\nWe breathe to bring\\noxygen into our system,\\nand we breathe to get\\nrid of carbon dioxide.\\nAnd we need both oxygen and carbon dioxide\\nin order to utilize fuel and\\nfor our brain and body to work.\\nIt's not the oxygen is good\\nand carbon oxide is bad.\\nThey have to be present\\nin the appropriate ratios.\\nSo one thing that is\\nvery clear is our ability\\nto deliver oxygen to working\\nmuscles enter our brain\\nis going to be important for our ability\\nto generate muscular effort\\nespecially of a kind of what\\nI was talking about today,\\nbut also weight training and other forms\\nof skill-based effort, et cetera.\\nAnd our ability to think.\\nIf you're holding your\\nbreath for too long,\\nif you're breathing too much,\\nif you're what they call\\nover-breathing or under breathing,\\nif you're shallow breathing,\\nif you're mouth breathing,\\nthese are all things that\\ncan really impede mental\\nand physical performance.\\nSo let's make it really simple\\nand then I promise to do a\\nfuture episode all about recipes.\\nThere are two main sources\\nof air for your body\\nand it's air coming in through your nose\\nand air coming in through your mouth.\\nIn general nasal breathing is better.\\nIt scrubs the air of bacteria and viruses.\\nYou have a microbiome in\\nyour nose that benefits.\\nThere are a number of reasons,\\nit's also just a more efficient\\nsystem believe it or not,\\neven though it feels like\\nyou can gulp more air\\nwith your mouth.\\nGetting good at nasal breathing is useful.\\nA gear - System of the\\ntype that Brian McKenzie\\nand colleagues have developed,\\nI think is a good way\\nto conceptualize this.\\nIf you're doing long duration work,\\ntry and do it all nasal breathing.\\nIf you have deviated septum,\\nit's probably cause you\\ndon't nasal breathe enough.\\nMouth breathing is something\\nthat many people suffer from.\\nYou are more prone to infections.\\nIt's not as efficient, et cetera.\\nThere is a place for mouth breathing.\\nHowever, it's usually, if you\\nneed to do a strong exhale,\\noftentimes you can discard\\nmore volume through the mouth,\\nunless you're very trained\\nat nasal breathing.\\nSo if you're doing high\\nintensity training,\\na good way to conceptualize\\nthis is to exhale\\non the max effort,\\nand then to inhale on\\nthe less intense part.\\nSo that might be as you're\\ngenerating the movement,\\nyou know, you're in the\\nconcentric part of the movement\\nyou exhale, right?\\nJust like on a bat swing\\nor something like that,\\nor fighters and martial artists\\ndo this differently depending\\non how they were trained\\nand their different purposes,\\nbut they kind of like huh or ssh,\\nthey kind of exhaling during the effort\\nand then inhaling on the\\nportion of the repetition\\nthat is not the highest effort portion.\\nUsually that's the eccentric phase\\nof anything involving or\\nrowing and things of that sort.\\nSo nasal breathing is great,\\nbut as you increase the\\nintensity of your endurance work,\\nyou will need to incorporate the mouth.\\nSo a gear system would look something\\nlike first gear would\\nbe just nasal breathing\\nor second gear would also\\nbe just nasal breathing.\\nBut with more effort, third gear again,\\npower speed endurance has\\na lot more about this.\\nYou can go to their website.\\nI think it's a very intelligent\\nway to conceptualize this.\\nAs you go into more max effort,\\nthen you're going to third\\nand fourth and fifth gear.\\nAnd at some point you're not\\nthinking about nose or mouth.\\nYou're just trying to\\nhang on for dear life\\nand complete the work safely.\\nAnd that means breathe through\\nwhatever orifice works for you.\\nSo that's one aspect, nose versus mouth.\\nThe other aspect is whether\\nor not you're using your ribs,\\nthe intercostal muscles are these muscles\\nthat the Bruce Lee had these\\nremarkable intercostal muscles\\nthat allow you to lift the\\nrib cage or the diaphragm\\nwhich is a skeletal muscle\\nthat sits below the lungs.\\nJust to remind you, when you inhale,\\nthe diaphragm moves down,\\nwhen you exhale, the diaphragm moves up.\\nOkay?\\nHere's something that most people don't do\\nand would benefit tremendously from.\\nAnd I can say this\\nbecause Andy Galpin's lab\\nhas done work on this\\nexploring how warming up\\nthe intercostals and the\\nnerve to diaphragm pathways\\nbefore any kind of endurance work\\nor in the first few\\nminutes of endurance work\\ncan allow you to breathe more deeply\\nand to deliver more oxygen to the blood,\\n[burps] excuse me,\\nand to the muscles and to\\nbe able to do more work\\nmore efficiently.\\nSo what that involves\\nis sometimes sitting,\\nsometimes standing and\\njust really concentrating\\non two things.\\nWe always hear about how we\\nshould diaphragmatic breathe.\\nAnd that means that our belly\\nmoves out when we inhale.\\nSo [inhales deeply] our stomach expands,\\nbut also expanding the intercostals\\nwhich means actually raising\\nthe ribs, chest breathing.\\nWe're all told that in yoga class\\ndon't breathe with your\\nchest this, [inhales deeply].\\nBut actually that is warming\\nup the intercostal muscles.\\nSo this is also a great\\nway to generate adrenaline\\nif you do it a little bit intensely.\\nSo let's say you're feeling\\nunmotivated to train,\\nI don't particularly like\\ndoing endurance training\\nuntil I'm actually doing it.\\nSo I use and benefit\\nfrom having a practice\\nwhere I'll just sit there\\nand for about three minutes\\nI'll just breathe very deeply\\ntrying to raise my chest\\nas much as I can for maybe a minute,\\nand then contracting my diaphragm\\nand expanding my stomach\\noutward when I inhale.\\nBy the end of that you're\\nactually delivering more oxygen\\nto your system.\\nMy lab has looked at this in\\na totally different context.\\nAndy's lab has looked at it in the context\\nof physical performance.\\nSo warming up the breathing\\nmuscles should make sense,\\ngiven that you now know\\nthat muscles and neurons\\nneed glucose and they need\\noxygen in order to function.\\nAnd so that's a great warmup.\\nYou can also do this while walking\\nor while getting on the\\nbike and starting to peddle,\\nreally starting to think about warming up\\nthe breathing system.\\nAnd then you can decide if\\nyou want to do pure nasal\\nor a combination of nasal and\\nmouth breathing and so on.\\nSo that's something that\\nwe don't often hear about.\\nThe other one.\\nThe other tool, rather that I talked about\\nin a previous episode,\\nI'll just mention again,\\nis some people when they\\ndo endurance type work\\nthey get a stitch in their side.\\nThey feel like they've got a side cramp.\\nVery rarely is it actually\\na skeletal muscular cramp,\\nit's oftentimes it's a referenced\\npain of the phrenic nerve\\nthat innervates the liver.\\nSo the phrenic nerve is responsible\\nfor the movement of the diaphragm.\\nIt is a very important system,\\nbut it has a number of\\nwhat we call collateral.\\nSo it branches to other organs.\\nRuns over other organs.\\nSometimes when we're breathing shallow\\nand we are in physical motion\\nand we're engaging in physical effort,\\nwe'll feel that side stitch.\\nAnd we think, oh, I've got a\\ncramp or maybe I'm dehydrated\\nor maybe I need to run\\nwith my hands over my head,\\nexcuse me.\\nTypically, you can\\nrelieve that side cramp,\\nwhich isn't a cramp at all.\\nThat side stitch by doing\\nthe double inhale, exhale,\\nreally breathing deeply. [inhales deeply]\\nAnd then sneaking a\\nlittle bit more air in.\\nThat's a double kind of firing\\nor what we call volume of action potential\\nsent from the phrenic\\nnerve to the diaphragm,\\nwhich will also activate that collateral,\\nthat branch literally of the nerve\\nthat innervates the liver.\\nAnd then when you exhale,\\nyou offload a bunch of carbon dioxide,\\nbut if you repeat that a few times often,\\nin fact, for me every time\\nbut often what'll happen\\nis that side stitch will\\njust naturally disappear.\\nJust means you're not breathing properly.\\nYou're the phrenic\\nnerve is firing in a way\\nthat's kind of aggravating\\nthat referenced pain.\\nThere's nothing kind of voodoo\\nor mysterious about this.\\nIt just has to do with the\\nway that the different nerves\\ntravel in the body.\\nSo as you set out on your run\\nor maybe you're going to do\\nsome muscular endurance work\\nor high intensity work,\\nwarming up the intercostals,\\nwarming up the diaphragm is good.\\nAnd there are exercises and there is work\\nthat you can do to\\nstrengthen the intercostals\\nand to strengthen the diaphragm\\nduring bouts of this kind of effort.\\nAnd I would say that one of the ways\\nthat you can do that best\\nis by really focusing\\non getting the maximum\\ndiaphragmatic expansion\\nand chest lifting.\\nWhat we're all told now not to do,\\nyou know, don't chest\\nbreathe, belly breathe.\\nThe intercostals are there for a reason\\nand they are perfectly\\ngood at filling your lungs.\\nAnd they work best when they collaborate\\nwith your diaphragm.\\nBut when you are starting to fatigue\\nto start to really inhale deeply\\nand try and really expand those to deliver\\nmore oxygen to your system.\\nWhile we're talking about\\ndelivering more oxygen\\nto your system,\\nI want to share with you a useful tool\\nthat will now make total sense\\nmechanistically why it works,\\nwhich is oftentimes when\\nwe are on a long run\\nor in long duration bouts of effort.\\nWe will hit the so-called wall, right?\\nWe will bonk.\\nI think they used to call it,\\ndo they still call it that Costello?\\nHe's asleep.\\nWe bonk.\\nWhere we just we think\\nno, we can't continue.\\nIt's a curious thing as to\\nwhether or not that's neural\\nor whether or not it's fuel-based,\\nthere's certainly going\\nto be a psychological\\nor motivational component.\\nBut one way that you can\\nreveal this kind of extra gear,\\nthe capacity to push on is\\nby understanding the way\\nthat different muscle fibers\\nuse energy differently.\\nRemember the fast-twitch\\nphosphocreatine system\\nand the slow twitch\\nsystem that relies mainly\\non lipids and glucose.\\nOkay, well, even if you\\ndon't remember all that,\\nif you've been running\\nsteadily for a long time\\nand you're starting to fatigue\\nand you feel like it's time to quit.\\nYou may have not tapped into\\nan alternative fuel source.\\nOne thing that you can\\ndo is you can actually\\nincrease your speed.\\nThis is also true of work\\nwhere you're doing repetitions\\nwith kettlebells or something.\\nYou can start to increase your speed.\\nSo run faster, pedal faster,\\nrow faster, swim faster\\nnot all out sprint.\\nBut in doing that, you're\\nshifting the the muscles\\nand the nerves over towards\\nutilizing a separate fuel source\\nor a distinct fuel source.\\nMaybe the phosphocreatine system\\nif it's a quick about\\nof intense acceleration,\\nor maybe it's a combination\\nof lipids and carbohydrates\\nin your system that weren't\\navailable to you prior.\\nNow, of course, if you completely deplete\\nyour liver glycogen,\\nyou completely deplete everything,\\nyou're only going to be\\nrunning on stored fuel and fats\\nand eventually you'll\\nstart metabolizing protein,\\nmuscles themselves.\\nBut this is a kind of a\\nunique way to realize that,\\noh, you weren't out of energy at all,\\nyou're just over-relying\\non one fuel source.\\nAnd this is the reason why,\\nespecially elite athletes\\nare starting to both rely\\non carbohydrates.\\nSo they're doing the whole carb depletion\\nthen carb loading thing.\\nThey're loading up their\\nliver and their muscles\\nwith plenty of glycogen\\nby eating pastas and rice\\nand stuff before races.\\nBut they are also ingesting\\nketones during races,\\nduring long bouts of effort,\\nbecause ketones can be\\na quick form of energy.\\nThere's no reason why\\nyou can't use ketones\\nif they are taking exogenous\\nketones and carbohydrate.\\nAnd in combination, remember\\nthe body is accustomed\\nto using multiple fuel sources,\\nfatty acids, carbohydrates\\nall these things.\\nIt's only in the, you\\nknow, of internet age\\nthat we think in terms of,\\noh, well you're either keto\\nor you're burning sugar,\\nor you're fat adapted\\nor key or fat fasting\\nor fast fasting or fat fatting.\\nCostello woke up when I said fat fatting.\\nI'm not talking about you Costello.\\nSo the point is that your body\\nis used to using multiple fuel sources.\\nSo if you're kind of hitting that wall,\\nsometimes accelerating can\\nactually allow you to tap\\ninto a new fuel source or\\ncombination of fuel sources\\njust based on the way\\nthat muscles use fuel.\\nSo that's another tool.\\nThe other thing that's really\\nimportant to think about\\nin terms of endurance\\ntype work is hydration.\\nAnd I think hydration is\\nimportant for all forms\\nof physical work and\\nexercise not just endurance.\\nThe deal with hydration\\nis that we've been taught\\nabout hydration all wrong.\\nBut let's remember what neurons work on?\\nWhat do they use in order to fire?\\nWell, they certainly need water, right?\\nWe need water in our system, I should say.\\nBut remember they use electrolytes,\\nsodium and potassium to\\ngenerate those action potentials\\nto actually get neurons to contract,\\nto be able, excuse me, muscles to contract\\nand for our brain to function\\nand to be able to think.\\nTypically, we're going to lose anywhere\\nfrom one to five pounds of\\nwater per hour of exercise.\\nAnd that's going to vary tremendously,\\nit's going to vary on weather,\\nit's going to vary on intensity,\\nprobably more like five pounds,\\nif it's hot day and you're\\nexercising very intensely.\\nSo about one to five pounds per hour.\\nNow, you know how much you weigh.\\nSo if you think about\\nyour weight in pounds,\\nonce you lose about one to 4%\\nof your body weight in water,\\nyou're going to experience\\nabout a 20 to 30% reduction\\nin work capacity.\\nIn your ability to generate\\neffort of any kind,\\nstrength, endurance, et cetera.\\nYou are also going to\\nexperience a significant drop\\nin your ability to think and\\nperform mental operations.\\nSo hydration is key.\\nNow, many people have been told,\\nwell, if you urinate\\nand your urine is clear,\\nwell, then you're hydrated enough.\\nSometimes that's true.\\nSometimes that's not true.\\nAlso and this isn't a\\ntopic I enjoyed discussing,\\nbut a urine is a biological phenomenon.\\nIt's actually filtered\\nblood every once in a while\\nand if there's a kid and\\nit's a family friend,\\nI'll say, \\\"Did you know that your pee\\n\\\"is actually filtered blood?\\\"\\nAnd they usually kind of go wide-eyed.\\nBut then they go, \\\"Oh,\\nthat's kind of cool.\\\"\\nLike kids have this natural curiosity\\nabout blood and pee and stuff.\\nThat's not contaminated by\\nour preconceived notions\\nof those things being gross,\\nbecause you're in being filtered blood\\ncan give you some indication as to whether\\nor not you're hydrated enough or not.\\nAnd in order to really assess that,\\nit's not going to be sufficient to urinate\\ninto another volume of water and assess\\nwhether or not your urine\\nis very dark or very light.\\nIt actually requires\\nurinating into a small volume\\nand saying, well, is it\\ndarker or lighter than before?\\nIt's not something you really\\nwant to do most places.\\nThe etiquette of most\\ngyms and environments\\nis not suitable for that.\\nBut one of the things that you can just do\\nis you configure,\\nwell, I'm going to lose one to\\nfive pounds of water per hour.\\nYou can show up to exercise\\nreasonably hydrated\\nwith electrolytes.\\nSo potassium, sodium and\\nmagnesium are really key.\\nYes, it's true, you can die\\nfrom drinking too much water\\nin particular because it forces you,\\nif you drink too much water,\\nyou excrete too many electrolytes\\nand your brain will shut off.\\nYou'll actually your heart\\nwill stop functioning properly.\\nSo you don't want to over\\nconsume to the extreme either,\\nbut there are a number of equations\\nthat go into figuring out\\nhow much water you need\\nbased on how intense\\nyour training, et cetera,\\nbody size, et cetera.\\nJust remember you burn,\\nyou lose, excuse me\\nabout one to five pounds\\nof water per hour,\\ndepending on how hot it is,\\nand how intensely you're exercising.\\nOnce your body weight drops by one to 4%.\\nSo you can just figure,\\nwell, if you lose five pounds per hour,\\nyou exercise for two hours.\\nLet's say you're about 200 pounds,\\nthat's about 10%.\\nOkay?\\nWell, you want to replace that\\nbefore you very quickly or not.\\nYou want to replace that all along\\nbefore you start experiencing\\nthis massive 20 to 30% reduction\\nin work capacity of muscles\\nand the brain.\\nA simple formula.\\nWhat I call it, the Galpin equation.\\nHereafter, referred to\\nas the Galpin equation\\nis a formula that gets you\\nclose to the exact amount\\nthat you would want that Dr.\\nAndy Galpin came up with,\\nwhich is your body weight in pounds\\ndivided by the number 30.\\nAnd that is how many\\nounces you should drink\\nfor every 15 minutes of exercise.\\nSo once again, the Galpin equation.\\nYour body weight in pounds divided by 30.\\nThat's the amount of fluid\\nto drink in ounces, right?\\nEvery 15 minutes of exercise.\\nNow, if you are sweating a lot,\\nyou may need more.\\nOkay?\\nIf you're already very well hydrated,\\nyou may need less,\\nbut that's a good rule of thumb to begin\\nand to start to understand\\nthe relationship\\nbetween hydration and performance.\\nThere is a phenomenon in\\nwhich gastric emptying,\\nthe ability to move stuff out of your gut,\\nincluding water and\\nelectrolytes out of your gut\\nand into the bloodstream and for delivery\\nto the tissues of your body for effort\\nis hindered when you get\\nabove 70% of your VO2 max.\\nIn other words when you're\\ndoing high intensity training\\nsometimes people experience\\nthat ingesting water\\nduring intense training is difficult.\\nIt is something that can\\nbe actually trained up.\\nIt's a matter of learning to kind of relax\\nyour abdominal muscles.\\nAnd there's some other\\naspects of adaptation\\nthat will allow you to drink\\nduring higher intensity work.\\nAs Galpin says, don't\\ntry and ingest fluids\\nwhen you're working out or competing\\nat higher than 70% of VO2 max\\nif you've never done it before.\\nYou want to train up this capacity.\\nPeople can learn how to\\nconsume fluids during a race\\nor consume fluids during bouts of exercise\\nthat are very intense.\\nAnd a lot of people don't want to do that,\\n'cause they don't want to have\\nto stop to urinate, et cetera.\\nBut given the crucial role of hydration\\nfor muscular performance\\nand for brain performance,\\nit seems that if you're\\ngoing to be doing a lot\\nof high intensity interval training\\nof the various concepts talked about today\\nor high intensity training of any kind\\nthat hydration is key and learning\\nor in other words, getting\\nyour system to adapt\\nto ingesting fluids in the\\nmiddle of these workouts\\nis something that seems beneficial.\\nAt least to me, in terms of the trade off\\nbetween being dehydrated\\nand the somewhat discomfort\\nof maybe drinking some fluids.\\nSo you sip small amounts\\nof fluid initially\\nand then you're able to\\ntake bigger and bigger gulps\\nas time goes on.\\nAnd pretty soon you're able\\nto drink mid-set or be,\\nexcuse me, not mid-set.\\nPlease don't do that between\\nsets and your workout\\nor while you're still breathing\\nhard after a mile repeat\\nor something of that sort\\nwithout much disruption\\nor any at all to your performance.\\nLast episode we talked\\nabout how to assess recovery\\nand things that you might want\\nto do to improve recovery,\\nhow exposure to ice baths\\nand cold showers can reduce inflammation\\nwhich can be great for recovery,\\nbut can inhibit some of the adaptations\\nfor strength and hypertrophy.\\nBecause inflammation isn't good or bad.\\nInflammation isn't like a\\nnice person or a mean person.\\nIt's both.\\nIt's a great thing for\\nstimulating adaptations,\\nbut you don't want it around too long.\\nAnd so we suggested that\\nyou not do ice baths\\nwithin probably six hours of any training\\nwhere the goal was hypertrophy\\nor strength training.\\nThere is some evidence\\nthat getting yourself\\ninto an ice bath or cold\\nshower after endurance training\\ncan actually improve the\\nmitochondrial aspects\\nof endurance exercise that\\nyou can get improvements\\nin mitochondrial density,\\nand you can get improvements\\nin mitochondrial respiration\\nby doing that afterwards\\nand that it can facilitate recovery.\\nThat's still a bit of\\na controversial area.\\nI do think that what I mentioned earlier\\nthat waiting at least six hours\\nand probably more like\\n24 hours between workouts\\nis a good idea.\\nThat getting at least one\\nfull day of rest each week,\\nfor some people that'll be two.\\nI have to say I'm one of these people\\nthat after two days of\\nabsolutely no exercise,\\nI do perform better\\nconsistently across all aspects\\nof physical performance and\\nmentally I feel better as well\\neven though I load to take those days off\\nunless I'm really exhausted\\nit does seem to help my training.\\nSome people can train seven\\ndays a week and they're fine.\\nI think it just is there's a\\nlot of individual variation.\\nYou want to work on sleep\\nand maximizing sleep\\nfor recovery nutrition,\\nof course, as well.\\nI talked about sleep in\\nthe first four episodes\\nof the podcast.\\nIf you have trouble with sleep\\ndefinitely check out those episodes.\\nIt's very clear and a\\nnumber of sports teams\\neven some folks that I work with,\\nand Andy Galpin and others\\nare starting to incorporate\\na what's called a\\nparasympathetic down-regulation\\nafter training of any kind as\\na way to accelerate recovery\\nand enable you to do more work.\\nIn other words, get\\nback to work out sooner.\\nWhat is parasympathetic downregulation?\\nIt means finishing your training\\nand instead of just hopping on the phone\\nor hopping into your car\\nand heading off to take\\nfive minutes minimum,\\nmaybe ideally more like 10 or 20,\\nbut for sake of time five minutes minimum\\nand doing just some slow pure\\nnasal long exhale breathing\\nor lying down and just kind of zoning out.\\nThat it seems can accelerate recovery\\nand allow you to get back\\ninto other types of work,\\nmental work or physical work more quickly\\nwhich makes total sense because\\nremember your nervous system\\nand recovery and work\\nis a local phenomenon\\nwhich muscles were you using.\\nYou know, were you using your glutes,\\nyour hams and your back\\nor were using your shoulders, et cetera.\\nBut it's also a systemic thing.\\nIt's also about those neurons\\nin the locus coeruleus that\\nare releasing epinephrine\\nand you want to quiet all\\nthat down after training.\\nYou want to really just zone out.\\nThink Costello, channel\\nyour inner Costello,\\nand just mellow out for five to 20 minutes\\nand then move into the rest of your day.\\nFive minutes should be manageable.\\nEven if it's just sitting in\\nthe car with your eyes closed\\ndoing that downregulation breathing.\\nI think you'll see big benefits in terms\\nof allowing yourself to come back sooner,\\ndo more work over time\\nand just perform and\\nfeel better generally,\\nas well as be able to\\nthink about other things\\nbesides the just how\\nmuch the previous workout\\nkind of beat you up.\\nA couple more things I think\\nare going to be useful.\\nAnd I do want to just pack these in,\\n'cause we are closing out the\\nmonth on physical performance.\\nAnd that's about\\nprogramming and about pacing\\nand the kind of mental\\naspects of endurance.\\nSo let's start with pacing and\\nmental aspects of endurance.\\nI learned from a friend and\\ncolleague here at the podcast\\nthat...\\nWho's very active in triathlon\\nand marathon and other...\\nKnows a lot about that whole world\\nand the competitive landscape there,\\nthat pacing and literally physical pacers\\nhave a laser on the ground\\nor visualizing or having a\\npace car or a pace runner\\nin front is actually not\\nallowed in many competitions.\\nAnd if those are present\\ndoesn't allow the race times\\nto qualify as legitimate\\nrecord holding times.\\nAnd that's very interesting to me\\nbecause what we know is\\nthat the visual system\\nhas this capacity to switch\\nback and forth between\\nwhat we call panoramic vision\\nwhere we're not really\\nfocused on anything.\\nThings are just flowing past us\\nor our eyes are just kind of zoned out.\\nSo I can do this right now\\nand you won't be able to tell\\nbut I'm looking at the\\ncorners of the room.\\nI see Costello down there on the floor.\\nI see my podcast team here\\nand I can also see the microphone.\\nI can see myself in this environment.\\nThat's panoramic vision.\\nWhereas if I draw my eyes to one location\\nlike right there in the\\ncenter of the camera,\\nit's what's called a\\nvergence eye movement.\\nSo I'm contracting my visual window.\\nThe contraction of the visual\\nwindow when that's done,\\nis the same thing that would happen\\nif I was tracking say a\\npace car or a pace runner\\nor a laser on the ground.\\nThe mere bringing our eyes together\\nto what we call a vergence\\npoint has the impact\\nof triggering the activation\\nof neural circuits\\nin the thalamus.\\nThings like zona incerta,\\nif you really want to\\nknow what their names are,\\nof these brain areas.\\nAs well as in the brainstem that activate\\nthe so-called alertness system,\\nthings like locus coeruleus,\\nwhereas panoramic vision tends to bring us\\ninto states of relaxation.\\nYou can actually leverage\\nus during your runs.\\nLet's say you're out for a long run\\nor you're swimming or you're cycling.\\nThis is probably easiest\\nto imagine out of the water\\nbefore I do in the water as well.\\nIf you focus your attention on a landmark\\nthat you're going to run to,\\nyou'll find that it's much easier\\nthan if you don't actually\\nhave a set milestone\\nor landmark that you're going to run to.\\nHowever, if you were to\\ncontinue that repeatedly\\njust going milestone after\\nmilestone, after milestone,\\nyou would feel more mentally fatigued\\nand you would actually be able\\nto degenerate less work overall.\\nOne thing that can be useful\\nis focusing on a milestone,\\nrunning to that milestone or biking\\nwhatever it is the activity happens to be,\\nand then dilating your field of view\\nto relax the system and\\nthen continuing again.\\nSo it's this kind of active contraction\\nor of the visual window and then dilation\\nof the visual window.\\nContraction of the visual\\nwindow allows you to generate\\nmore effort but there's\\na cost to doing that,\\nbecause neurons consume energy.\\nAnd now you know how they do that.\\nWhereas dilation allows you to essentially\\nbe more efficient, right?\\nNow, pacing is not allowed or\\nhaving a pacer, a visual pacer\\nbecause it does allow\\nyou to access systems\\nin the brain and body that\\nallow you to create more energy,\\nmore effort.\\nAnd so I find it interesting\\nthat I think in a kind\\nof subconscious genius\\nthe race officials and\\nthe governing bodies\\nof these races have said,\\nokay, sure, having a pacer\\nthere or someone in front,\\nyou can draft off of them,\\nthere's actually a kind\\nof a aerodynamic effect\\nof having someone in front of you\\nthat makes it easier to run in\\nthe wake of their airstream.\\nSo to speak.\\nSame as true in cycling.\\nThis is why the cycling teams are so good\\nat maneuvering and packs.\\nIn very specific ways, you\\ncan go faster with less effort\\nif you're drafting as it's\\ncalled behind somebody.\\nBut as well where you place\\nyour vision will allow you\\nto generate more effort.\\nAnd so it's interesting\\nthat they've taken out\\nthis kind of, if you will,\\nperformance enhancing tool.\\nI imagine and I have to imagine\\nit's the appropriate word here.\\nThat good runners, good\\ncyclists have the ability\\nto create a kind of\\npacer in their minds eye.\\nI have to imagine that they're\\nnot just completely allowing\\ntheir attention to drift,\\nalthough they do that when they\\nwant to be in highly efficient\\nmode generating effort\\nwithout having to tax\\ntheir mental capacity.\\nAnd remember mental\\ncapacity is neural energy\\nand consumes glucose energy\\nthat they could devote\\nto the functioning of their body.\\nBut that when needed that they\\ncan focus their energy in,\\nand actually kind of chase a\\nmental pacer or pick milestone.\\nSo this is a mental game\\nthat you can play as well.\\nIt's a little bit hard to do\\nin the context of weightlifting\\nin the gym.\\nIt's more of a moving\\nthrough space kind of thing,\\nbut some people do this by\\ncounting reps, et cetera.\\nI think it's especially\\nsuitable for endurance type\\nof exercise, especially done outside.\\nOne of the reasons I hate\\nrunning on a treadmill\\nis it just feels like it's never ending.\\nAnd I've never tried one\\nof these Peloton things.\\nI try and avoid looking at screens\\nas much as I possibly can.\\nBut if you try this next\\ntime you're out for a run\\nor a swim.\\nWhat you'll find is\\nthat you have a capacity\\nto engage a system of higher energy output\\nwhen you focus your eyes\\non a particular location,\\nbut you want to use that judiciously\\nbecause your goal of course,\\nis to become efficient at\\nmoving through space over time\\nand not taxing your brain\\nand body to the point\\nwhere you arrive at the end of that,\\nunless it's race day just\\ncompletely tapped out.\\nSo that's a kind of\\ninteresting aspect of running.\\nIf you're a fan of running, which I am,\\nand you get the chance to look\\nat any of the documentaries\\nor docu-drama has made\\nabout, [clears throat]\\nexcuse me, about Steve Prefontaine.\\nIt was clear that he was mostly\\nin a battle with himself,\\nbut that he was also a highly\\ncompetitive individual.\\nAnd you'll see this in some of his races.\\nI do encourage you to look\\nsome of those up on YouTube\\nor see the docudramas.\\nThey're quite good.\\nWhere he ran the...\\nEssentially was 12 laps on a track.\\nIt's essentially the five.\\nIt is the 5,000 meter race\\nwhere essentially three miles.\\nAnd he essentially tried\\nto sprint the whole thing\\nwhich is ridiculous.\\nActually knowing what you know today\\nyou'll realize that Steve Prefontaine\\nbasically was pulling\\nfrom strength, speed,\\npower, muscular, endurance,\\nlong duration effort, high intensity,\\naerobic, anaerobic as he sort of tried\\nto maximize every fuel system.\\nAnd you'll see that in\\nthe races that he runs,\\nbut that when runners are\\nnearing the final laps,\\nthe so-called bell lap of a race,\\nthey'll often look to one another to see\\nwhere somebody is obviously\\nto assess their progress\\nand how close somebody is?\\nBut when somebody gets past,\\noftentimes you'll see someone\\naccess this mysterious kick,\\nthis ability to tap into\\nsome additional gear\\nthat allows them to run forward or faster\\nwhen they themselves actually thought\\nthat they were maxed out.\\nSo someone could be running\\nfor the finish line.\\nThey're convinced they're going to win.\\nThey're going max effort\\nor at least they perceive max effort.\\nSomeone passes them.\\nAnd all of a sudden\\nmax effort has changed,\\nbecause of that visual target\\nthey are able to access higher levels\\nof speed and output and\\neffort and performance.\\nThey don't always catch\\nup to that person and win,\\nbut having a target a\\nmilestone is a powerful way\\nthat we can generate more\\nforce and energy in anything.\\nAnd the visual system\\nis the way that we bring\\nthose milestones into our brain,\\nwhich then brings about epinephrin,\\nwhich brings about neural firing,\\nwhich allows us to\\naccess whatever resources\\nhappen to be available to us.\\nSo I find this fascinating\\nbecause people often wonder,\\nlike where does the kick come from?\\nWhere is this kind of gift\\nof an additional gear?\\nWhere is that deeper resource?\\nAnd we often express it and talk about it,\\nin kind of psychological\\nterms like heart or willpower\\nor that something kind of\\ngot transplanted into us\\nor descended into us.\\nAnd not to remove any of the\\nspiritual aspects of sport\\nor running or effort of\\nthe human, you know, heart.\\nBut it's very clear\\nthat the nervous system\\nwhen it has a specific visual target\\ncan generate the sorts of intense effort\\nthat it couldn't otherwise.\\nAnd it sometimes even comes as a surprise\\nto the person generating the effort.\\nI promised that I would\\ntalk about programming,\\nmeaning when and how many times a week\\nto do the various workouts\\nrelated to endurance\\nand how to merge those with\\nother types of exercise\\nthat you might be doing\\nfor strength or yoga\\nor other things that you\\nmight be doing like work\\nand other things, unrelated to exercise.\\nSince that's a vast space\\nwith many different parameters\\nand you all have different\\nlives and lifestyles\\nand backgrounds with fitness, et cetera.\\nWhat I'm going to do is I'm going to put\\nthree different levels\\nif you will or protocols\\nthat one could adopt in\\na link on the show notes.\\nSo in the caption on YouTube,\\nif you click on that link,\\nyou'll be able to see\\nthree possible combinations\\nof endurance work, strength,\\nand hypertrophy work\\nor endurance work, flexibility\\nand hypertrophy work\\nthat are grounded in many\\nof the major publications\\nthat Dr. Andy Galpin and\\ncolleagues and other people\\nhave described including this review\\nthat's also linked there\\non concurrent training\\nand how one can use concurrent training,\\nmeaning training for endurance,\\ntraining for strength,\\ntraining for hypertrophy,\\ntraining for all these different things\\nwithout having to train\\nconstantly everyday\\ntwice a day, et cetera.\\nSo if you are interested\\nin taking the protocols\\nthat you learned about in this episode\\nand in previous episodes\\nand combining those,\\nwe've placed them there for you\\nas a completely zero cost resource.\\nPlease understand they are not wholly...\\nCostello agrees.\\nThey are not wholly.\\nThere will be variation in terms\\nof what people can tolerate\\nand what they have time for?\\nBut I think they'll serve\\nas a useful guideline\\nin getting started or in\\ncontinuing with an expanding\\non existing endurance work, strength work,\\nhypertrophy work and so forth.\\nJust really quickly.\\nWe didn't talk about\\nsupplements much today.\\nIn the previous episodes I talked about\\nthe phosphocreatine system and\\nsupplementing with creatine,\\nI talked about beta alanine\\nfor kind of moderate duration work.\\nYou know really the only\\nthings that have been shown\\nto really improve endurance\\nwork across the four varieties\\nof endurance work I described today.\\nThey have essentially two forms.\\nOne, are stimulants.\\nSo things like caffeine will definitely\\nimprove endurance work and power output.\\nThere's a little bit of evidence\\nthat caffeine intake can actually inhibit\\nthe function of the creating system,\\nbut it's just one study.\\nBut that's interesting.\\nIf you want to read that study,\\nyou can put caffeine into www.examine.com\\nand it will take you to that study.\\nMany people get sore after workouts,\\nin particular workouts\\nthat involve a lot of eccentric loading\\nor workouts that are very novel\\nwhere they've kind of pushed\\nit instead of moving gradually\\nas I suggest into say high\\nintensity anaerobic endurance\\nwork of three sets of 20\\nseconds on 100 seconds rest.\\nMaybe you get over ambitious\\nand you do eight sets.\\nIn which case you are extremely sore.\\nCertain forms of magnesium in particular,\\nmagnesium malate, M-A-L-A-T-E.\\nHave been shown to be useful for removing\\nor reducing the amount of\\ndelayed onset muscle soreness.\\nThat form of magnesium\\nis distinctly different\\nthan the sorts of magnesium that are good\\nfor getting us into sleep.\\nThings like magnesium three\\nand eight and Bisglycinate.\\nAnd then there's this whole\\nthing about beet powder\\nand beet juices and things\\nthat increase nitric oxide\\nand allow for more vasodilation\\nand therefore delivery\\nof blood to muscle and\\nneurons and other tissues\\nfor long bouts of endurance work.\\nSome people like beet juice\\nand they related compounds\\nthat increase arginine and vasodilation.\\nSome people don't.\\nSome people don't feel\\ngood when they take those.\\nSome people also don't feel good\\nwhen they take beta alanine,\\nbecause it can give them this feeling\\nof kind of like itchy, creepy\\ncrawlies under the skin\\nkind of the niacin\\nphenomenon, the niacin flush.\\nSome people don't mind that,\\nor some people don't experience that.\\nSo when it comes to supplementation\\nthere's a lot of variety.\\nBut magnesium malate has\\nbeen shown to reduce soreness\\nas sometimes that's good.\\nCold and hot contrast therapy for soreness\\nthings of that sort.\\nBut in general, we focused\\nmainly today on behavioral tools.\\nYou'll notice that all of\\nthe tools are accessible\\nwithout the need for lots of equipment.\\nSo I didn't say you need a rower,\\nor you need a kettlebell\\nthough those will work.\\nAnd I hope I was able to\\nillustrate for you that endurance\\nisn't just one thing.\\nIt's not just the ability to\\ngo for long bouts of exercise\\nof different kinds,\\nthat there's also this mental component\\nbecause of the way that neurons work.\\nAnd also that there are these\\ndifferent forms of endurance\\nof muscular endurance,\\nthat where you're going to fail\\n'cause of the muscles and\\nmuscle energy utilization\\nand the nerves that innovate\\nthose muscles locally\\nnot because of a failure to\\nbring in oxygen or blood.\\nWhereas long duration effort.\\nIt's going to be more about,\\nyou know, being below your VO2 max,\\nand your ability to be\\nefficient for long bouts\\nof more than 12 minutes of exercise.\\nOne set, as they say of 12\\nminutes to maybe several hours.\\nI should just mention with\\nlong duration type work.\\nYou know, you could even\\nimagine raking in the yard\\nor mowing a lawn depending\\non how big that lawn is.\\nI use to have job when\\nI was a kid mowing lawns\\nand I'll tell you,\\nwe didn't have many neighbors\\nwith very big lawns,\\nbut there are a few of them felt huge\\n'cause they were really convoluted.\\nAnd if you're pushing that mower,\\nand these were the old fashioned mowers\\nnot electric mowers, it's work.\\nThat's also of the sort\\nthat we call long duration\\nendurance work.\\nHigh intensity training we'll tap\\ninto yet other fuel sources and mechanisms\\nas we learned today.\\nSo if you are enjoying this podcast\\nand you're finding the information useful,\\nit would be great if you would subscribe\\nto the YouTube channel that\\nreally

of\\nNeurobiology and Ophthalmology\\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\\nRecently, I had the pleasure\\nof hosting two live events:\\none in Seattle, Washington\\nand one in Portland, Oregon,\\nboth entitled, \\\"The Brain Body Contract,\\\"\\nwhere I discussed science\\nand science related tools\\nfor mental health, physical\\nhealth, and performance.\\nMy favorite part of each\\nevening, however, was the\\nquestion and answer period\\nthat followed the lecture.\\nI love the question and answer period\\nbecause it gives me an opportunity\\nto hear directly from the audience\\nto what they want to know most,\\nand indeed to get into a bit of dialogue\\nso we really clarify\\nwhat are the underlying\\nmechanisms of particular tools,\\nhow best to use the tools for\\nthings like focus and sleep,\\nwe also touched on some things related to\\nmental health and physical health.\\nIt was a delight for me\\nand I like to think that\\nthe audience learned a lot.\\nI know that many of you weren't\\nable to attend those events,\\nbut we wanted to make the\\ninformation available to you.\\nSo what follows this\\nis a recording of the\\nquestion and answer period,\\nfrom the lecture in Seattle, Washington.\\nI hope you'll find it\\nto be both interesting and informative.\\nI'd also like to thank our\\nsponsors of these live events.\\nThe first is Momentous supplements,\\nwhich is our partner with\\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast,\\nproviding supplements that\\nare the very highest quality,\\nthat ship international,\\nand that are arranged\\nin dosages and single\\ningredient formulations\\nthat make it possible for you\\nto develop the optimal\\nsupplement strategy for you.\\nAnd I'd also like to\\nthank our other sponsor,\\nwhich is InsideTracker,\\nwhich provides blood tests and DNA tests\\nso you can monitor\\nyour immediate and\\nlong-term health progress.\\nI'd also like to announce\\nthat there are two, new\\nlive events scheduled.\\nThe first one is going\\nto take place Sunday,\\nOctober 16th at The Wiltern\\ntheater in Los Angeles.\\nThe other live event will\\ntake place Wednesday,\\nNovember 9th at the Beacon\\nTheatre in New York City.\\nTickets to both of those\\nevents are now available\\nonline at hubermanlab.com/tour;\\nthat's hubermanlab.com/tour.\\nI do hope that you learn from an enjoy\\nthe recording of the\\nquestion and answer period\\nthat follows this, and last,\\nbut certainly not least,\\nthank you for your interest in science.\\n[upbeat music plays]\\n\\\"What is your most used protocol?\\\"\\nI'm assuming that you mean the\\nprotocol that I use the most.\\nI genuinely do the\\nmorning sunlight viewing.\\nAnd this evening I went\\nand looked at the sunset,\\nevery single evening,\\nand I absolutely do 10 to 30 minutes\\nof some Non-Sleep Deep Rest\\nprotocol, every single day,\\nevery single day!\\nThe reason I called it Non-Sleep Deep Rest\\nis because while I love\\nthe classic traditions of,\\nand things like Yoga Nidra,\\nmy fear was that if I\\ncalled things Yoga Nidra,\\nthat people would get spooked.\\nBut I also have to say\\nthat I rather loathe\\nthe fact that scientists\\nuse so many fancy terms,\\nthat it also vaults information\\nfrom the very people that fund the work.\\nSo I have a kind of an ax to grind\\nwith the scientific community too.\\nSo Non-Sleep Deep Rest was my attempt\\nto kind of put my arms around\\na number of different things\\nlike Yoga Nidra, which I\\nhave great reverence for,\\nand other tools like that.\\nI do that usually in the early afternoon,\\nor if I wake up first thing in the morning\\nand I haven't slept\\nenough, or not that well,\\nI'll do 30 minutes of Yoga Nidra\\nand I feel terrific after that.\\nI'll just mention a brief anecdote.\\nI learned about Yoga Nidra\\nwhile researching a book\\nthat I never wrote, that may\\nor may not ever be published.\\nI went and spent a week\\nin a trauma center and addiction\\ntreatment center in Florida\\nand saw some amazing work,\\nof some amazing people,\\nand some amazing transformations\\nand it was a big part\\nof their daily routine,\\nfor these people to do Yoga\\nNidra and Non-Sleep Deep Rest\\nand I thought they're\\nreally onto something here.\\nSo almost religiously for me,\\nevery day, 10 to 30 minutes.\\nNot that it matters,\\nbut the CEO of Google's really into NSDR.\\nI don't know him,\\nbut he's written about\\nthat a number of times.\\n\\\"In Seattle, sunrise varies\\nfrom 4:30 AM to 9:00 AM,\\ndepending on season,\\nare you recommending to vary\\nyour wake-up/outside\\ntime with the seasons?\\\"\\nSomewhat.\\nYou know, you don't need to\\nsee the sun cross the horizon.\\nThat would be great,\\nbut not everyone can wake up with the sun.\\nYou want to get so-called\\nlow solar angle sunlight.\\nWhy?\\n'Cause of that yellow-blue contrast\\nthat we talked about before.\\nMany people wake up before the sun is out.\\nIf that case, if you want to be awake,\\nturn on as many bright lights as you can.\\nUp here, I don't know, does anyone here,\\nyou don't have to admit\\nthis if you don't want to,\\nbut maybe nod or raise your hand\\nif you're comfortable with doing that.\\nIn the winter you feel less well,\\nor typically in the transition,\\nyeah, it's huge up here.\\n[audience laughing]\\nIt's really, it's amazing.\\nAnd then when you're on campus\\nor that's where I've spent time\\nand you see Rainier and it's like,\\nthe blossoms are out\\nand you feel almost high\\nbecause that's dopamine, you know,\\nanimals that have white\\npelage in the winter,\\nand then it turns dark in\\nthe summer and spring months\\nthat pathway, the melanin\\npathway, is from tyrosine,\\nwhich is the precursor to dopamine\\nand also to melanin production in the fur.\\nSo the whole system is linked.\\nIt's not rigged, it's linked.\\nSo what do I suggest?\\nI suggest in the winter months,\\ngetting 30 minutes of sunlight viewing.\\nI know it's a lot,\\nbut it's much better than\\nfeeling lousy all day.\\nAnd then the real key in the winter\\nis to try and catch some\\nsunlight before it goes down.\\nIf you're indoors and it goes down\\nand then you go outside and it's dark,\\nyour brain and body\\ndon't really know where they are in time.\\nAnd then you flip on \\\"Ozark\\\"\\nand you're watching \\\"Ozark\\\",\\nand then you really don't\\nknow where you are in time.\\nI have one more episode.\\nDon't tell me what happened.\\nThat show is, when I was a postdoc,\\nI used to recommend, \\\"The\\nWire,\\\" to my competitors.\\n[audience laughing]\\nTrue.\\n\\\"I go to sleep fired up,\\nready and excited to do whatever it takes.\\nWhen I wake up, that drive is depleted.\\nWhy, and what can I do?\\\"\\nInteresting.\\nHave not heard that one before,\\nbut if I were to venture\\na guess, you know,\\nwe didn't spend much time tonight\\ntalking about the\\nautonomic nervous system,\\nthis kind of seesaw that\\ntakes us from very alert,\\npotentially panicked, but\\nto very, very deep sleep;\\neven, you know, God\\nforbid we go into a coma.\\nIt's 'cause the\\nparasympathetic nervous system\\nis overactive relative to the\\nsympathetic nervous system;\\nthe seesaw of autonomic function.\\nYou may be sleeping very, very deeply.\\nAnd when you are in deep, deep rest,\\nthe last thing you want to do\\nis get into that forward center of mass\\nthinking, planning, predicting, right?\\nIn, you know, again in Yoga Nidra again,\\nNon-Sleep Deep Rest,\\nthere's this common theme in the script\\nof going from thinking\\nand doing and predicting\\nto being and feeling, they say.\\nAnd I'm not making fun of them\\nas the moment I hear that,\\nI go, \\\"Oh, just I want to be and feel.\\\"\\nWhat are you doing?\\nYou're actually just\\nmoving into sensation,\\nbut no planning, right?\\nThere's nothing mysterious about it.\\nSensation, but no planning.\\nNow in sleep,\\na very deeply parasympathetic\\nsleep state, what's happening?\\nYou actually, that visual aperture\\nis actually so big, you're\\nnot in panoramic vision,\\nyour eyes are actually closed.\\nSpace and time are from\\npast, present, and future\\nare invited into your thinking.\\nYou're in a deep, deep state of relaxation\\nand it may be, Dustin,\\nthat when you're waking up,\\nyou're having a hard time\\ntransitioning out of that\\nbecause you're sleeping so deeply.\\nYou may be waking up mid-sleep cycle.\\nMany people find it useful to set an alarm\\nso that they wake up\\nat the end of a 90 minute\\nso-called ultradian cycle.\\nThere's some sleep apps\\nthat do this on the phone.\\nI can't recall their names,\\nbut so rather than sleeping seven hours,\\nyou might be better off sleeping six\\nor seven and a half hours, right?\\nWaking up at the end of one\\nof these 90 minute cycles.\\nTry that.\\nThat would be consistent\\nwith what we know about the biology.\\nBut I think it's common to,\\nif you sleep very deeply,\\nto wake up and not necessarily\\nwant to spring out of bed.\\nI've heard of these people\\nthat just want to spring out\\nof bed and attack the day;\\nJocko Willink, 4:30 in the morning,\\nhis Casio phone, and his watch.\\nI'm seeing his watch when,\\nand it's like eight for me.\\nI'm like, \\\"Wow,\\\" like again,\\nthese people are amazing.\\nI must be doing something wrong.\\nBut these are, you know,\\nI don't wake up that way.\\nYou know?\\nLike Tiger, I'm like, I\\nwant water, I want sunlight,\\n90 minutes later I want caffeine.\\nYeah.\\n\\\"What are some of your favorite books\\nthat have had the biggest impact on you?\\\"\\nKyle G, thank you, Kyle.\\nGosh, so many!\\nYou know, for non-fiction, well,\\nOliver Sack's autobiography,\\n\\\"On the Move,\\\"\\nhad a profound impact on me.\\nYou know, people hated him?\\nThe scientific community\\ntried to kick him out.\\nThey said horrible things about him;\\ncreated all sorts of scandals.\\nIt wasn't until \\\"Awakenings\\\"\\nbecame a blockbuster movie\\nthat suddenly he got\\nappointments at NYU and Columbia.\\nHa!\\nThen now they wanted him\\nback; the revered neurologist.\\nLike incredible, right?\\nBut he was also a real seeker\\nin the cuttlefish thing.\\nAnd he had a lot of\\ninternal struggles too,\\nsome of which I relate\\nto, some of which I don't.\\nActually, I've been in touch\\nwith his former partner\\nbecause I actually moved to\\nTopanga Canyon for a short while\\njust 'cause Oliver lived there.\\nI thought, \\\"If I go there, I'll\\nactually finish this book.\\\"\\nGuess what?\\nJust moving someplace doesn't\\nallow you to finish a book.\\nHe lived in Topanga so I\\nwas like, \\\"That's the key.\\\"\\nIt didn't work.\\nAnd people were wondering why\\nI was hanging around\\ntheir house all the time\\n'cause it was Oliver's former home.\\nSo that's an amazing book,\\nand tells you my obsessive nature.\\nThe other books that have had\\na profound influence on me,\\nI would say in the non-fiction realm,\\nwell I learned how to make a decent steak\\nand a few other simple recipes, not well,\\nfrom Tim Ferris's book,\\n\\\"The Four Hour Chef,\\\"\\n'cause I really needed help.\\nThat was a fun one.\\nI like Robert Greene's book, \\\"Mastery,\\\"\\nbecause I've had amazing mentors\\nand that book is all about finding mentors\\nand assigning mentors to you,\\neven if you don't know them.\\nAnd as you can tell from\\nmy stories about Oliver,\\nwho I never met, and a few other folks,\\nthat I've just decided\\nthat they don't know it,\\nbut I'm mentoring them,\\nthat they're mentoring me, excuse me,\\nthat book was really important for me.\\nAnd that mentor-mentee relationships\\nalways involve a breakup,\\neither by death, or by\\ndecision, or by consequence,\\nto your circumstance rather.\\nThere's, something happens,\\nand they're supposed to break.\\nYou're not supposed to\\napprentice with somebody forever.\\nThat was an interesting book for me.\\nI would say in the fiction realm,\\n[Andrew sighs]\\nI would say in the fiction\\nrealm, it's all childhood books\\n'cause it's been a long time\\nsince I've read fiction.\\nI read a lot of poetry. I'm\\na big Wendell Berry fan.\\nI like poetry because poetry to me is,\\nis like the subconscious, it,\\nthe structure is all messed up\\nand you think you understand\\nwhat they're talking about\\nbut you don't really know.\\nAnd so it always feels\\nimportant and consequential,\\neven though, you know, it's\\nyour own interpretation.\\nAnd then I love the\\npsychologists. I love Jung.\\nI love Erikson.\\nI love the psychologists\\nand could read endlessly\\nabout the early days of attachment theory\\nand things like that\\nbecause I find that\\nstuff to be fascinating.\\nSo those books have been a lot of fun\\nand I love picture books with animals.\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd so if you can get a hold of\\nJoel Sartore's Instagram\\naccount, the \\\"Photo Ark,\\\"\\nhe decided to take pictures\\nof every animal on the planet,\\nespecially the ones that are endangered.\\nHe's a amazing photographer,\\nbut his books are even better\\nso if you like animal books.\\n\\\"What excites you most\\nabout the future research\\nof mental health treatment,\\nparticularly anxiety and depression?\\\"\\nOi! Michael, thank you, Michael.\\nWell there, I think that\\nwe're in an exciting time.\\nI am, I'll just reveal my biases,\\nI'm quite pessimistic at the idea\\nthat we're going to have\\nbetter medication soon for most things.\\nWhat I do think we are\\nstarting to approach\\nis a time in which we understand\\nhow broad categories of drugs\\nimpact broad categories of chemicals,\\nwhich kind of shift our mind\\nin broad categories of directions.\\nWhat does all that mean?\\nI think we're starting to\\nrealize that because there are\\ndifferent receptors\\nfor all these chemicals\\nall over the brain and body,\\nthat that side effect-less drug\\nis unlikely to exist for mental health,\\nbut that the combination of,\\nmaybe some pharmacology,\\nbut especially behavioral\\ntools, people actually learning\\nhow to drive this thing that\\nwe call our nervous system\\nis potentially helpful,\\nmaybe very helpful.\\nNow in cases like schizophrenia, autism,\\nand I didn't put those next\\nto one another for any reason\\nby the way, OCD,\\neating disorders,\\nand I'm very mindful of the fact that,\\nyou know, anorexia is\\nthe most lethal of all the\\npsychiatric disorders, right?\\nAmazing and sad fact.\\nI think for those conditions,\\nwe are soon going to enter a time\\nin which it's going to be\\ncombination behavioral,\\ndrug therapy, and yes,\\nbrain-machine interface.\\nI don't mean putting chips\\ndown below the skull.\\nI think there's going to be,\\nand there are things happening now\\nof people using devices\\nlike virtual reality,\\nas well as transcranial\\nmagnetic stimulation,\\nplacing a magnet on a\\nparticular location on the head\\ncombined with a particular,\\nmaybe drugs, maybe psychedelics,\\nmaybe not, to enhance plasticity.\\nI urge a vote for psychedelics\\nand I want to make a serious\\npoint about psychedelics.\\nFive years ago, when\\nI, well, four years ago\\nwhen I started doing a bit\\nof public-facing stuff,\\nI was absolutely terrified\\nto say that word; terrified.\\nI thought I'd lose my job.\\nI really did. I thought,\\n\\\"Don't say psychedelics.\\\"\\nAnd I'll be very honest, you know,\\nI, for me,\\nI think that the clinical data\\non MDMA and on psilocybin\\nare very interesting, very interesting.\\nI don't think they are\\nthe first and only pass\\nat rewiring the brain,\\nbut it is clear that the brain\\ncan enter a state of\\nheightened learning capacity,\\nbut it needs to be\\ndirected towards something.\\nThe goal of opening plasticity,\\njust, it opens plasticity.\\nThat's not the goal.\\nIt's like running; the goal isn't running.\\nThe goal is to run in\\na particular direction.\\nSo what I think is really needed\\nis to drive that plasticity\\nin particular directions.\\nAnd I would love to see more\\ndirected use of those in,\\nof course, the safe clinical\\nsetting where it's appropriate.\\nAnd a guest on the\\npodcast, Matthew Johnson,\\nwho's at Johns Hopkins,\\nI asked him, \\\"What's the\\ndeal with the microdosing?\\\"\\nAnd you know what his answer\\nwas? I was very surprised.\\nHe said, \\\"Macrodose.\\\"\\nAnd I thought, okay, I'm\\nnot a guy who, you know,\\nI'm not into, I'm not,\\nI'm not a pushing this.\\nI'm not a proponent. I said,\\n\\\"You're kidding me. Why?\\nWhy would you say this?\\\"\\nThis guy runs an NIH funded lab\\nat Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.\\nI thought, \\\"Why?\\\"\\nAnd he said,\\n\\\"Because the one session\\nwith a trained professional\\nthat's triggering rewiring plasticity,\\nthat's guided, is,\\\" as far\\nas they know from the data,\\nyou can go back and listen\\nto, these are his words,\\nnot mine, but he's the\\nexpert in this area,\\n\\\"are encouraging plasticity\\nin a particular direction.\\\"\\nAnd he thinks that that's far more useful\\nthan just kind of nudging\\nthe system a little bit\\nwithout any particular goal or outcome.\\nVery interesting, and very surprising.\\nAnd again, a trained academic\\nat one of the most elite\\ninstitutions in the world.\\nI think we're in very exciting\\ntimes, for those compounds.\\nAnd they're like,\\nthere are studies at\\nStanford and elsewhere\\non ketamine and other\\nthings, but it's early days.\\nYoung people should be very cautious,\\nyoung, young people,\\nand adults should be cautious,\\nespecially people with\\npreexisting psychiatric issues\\nand people who have a\\npropensity for addiction\\nalthough some of those compounds\\nare being used to treat addiction.\\nSo I'd be an idiot and I would be lying,\\nif I didn't say\\nthat it is a very exciting\\ntime for psychedelic therapies.\\n[audience cheering and applauding]\\n\\\"Where do you see the biggest area?\\\"\\nand I've done only one clinical trial.\\nTrue. I was a part I took\\npart in one clinical trial.\\nSo I don't speak from a\\nlot of experience there,\\njust a little bit.\\nI was a subject in that trial.\\n\\\"Where do you see the biggest area\\nfor performance enhancement\\nwithin the elite athletes and operators\\nthat already hit marks of\\nproper sleep and nutrition?\\\"\\nMeg Young, thanks for your question, Meg.\\nYeah, I think that, well, first of all,\\nvery few of them hit\\nmarks for proper sleep.\\nBut for those that do, so once\\nyou have your sleep dialed in\\nand you got your nutrition dialed in,\\nand the motivational component is there,\\nI think where there's a lot\\nof work still to be done\\nand where people can really\\nget outsized effects,\\nis in this weird little\\ncavern of human existence\\nthat we call creativity.\\nAnd I didn't have time to\\ntalk about it tonight, but\\nthere's a very unique brain\\nstate that we call creativity,\\nwhich is taking preexisting neural maps\\nand starting to combine\\nthem in unique ways\\nto create new ways of performance.\\nPerformance can be basically\\nsummarized in any domain\\nas essentially four stages.\\nYou have unskilled, skilled, mastery,\\nwhich is when the brain\\ncan generate movements\\nor cognitive computations that are,\\ncreate very predictable outcomes\\nand then there's this fourth\\ntier, this fourth layer,\\nwhich is virtuosity.\\nAnd virtuosity, by definition,\\nmeans inviting back in a\\ncomponent of uncertainty.\\nWhat this looks like in terms of operators\\nor this looks like in terms of athletes,\\nor even we can say musicians,\\nor people who are in the cognitive fields,\\nor poets, or writers,\\nis what it means is introducing that\\nuncertainty about what's\\ngoing to happen next\\nand the way to do that is\\nto destabilize the system.\\nIn other words, to create states of mind\\nin which there are literally\\nsensory disruptions.\\nIt's like, like what I would\\nlike to see is more training\\nin a kind of \\\"funhouse of\\nmirrors\\\" type environment.\\nThat's when you start to see\\nincredible performances emerge.\\nAnd virtuosos invite in uncertainty,\\nthey actually don't know what\\nthey're going to do next.\\nAnd so this becomes a little\\nbit of a vague concept\\nand what I'm about to tell you next\\nmight seem a little silly,\\nbut one of the best ways\\nto access creative states\\nis to, no surprise, use your visual system\\nto view things that are\\nhighly unstable and uncertain.\\nI don't just love fish tanks;\\nI love staring at videos\\nof aquariums in Tokyo,\\nand actually watching the fish\\nbecause it's completely unpredictable.\\nThere's some evidence that\\ndoing things like that\\nor people would say,\\n\\\"Oh, I was in the shower,\\\"\\nor, \\\"I took a walk in nature\\nand then I had this idea.\\\"\\nI actually don't think it\\nwas the walk or the shower,\\nit's that nature is\\nfilled with unpredictable\\nvisual stimuli, auditory stimuli.\\nWhen you can predict what's\\ngoing to happen next,\\nyou have very little opportunity\\nto uplevel your game so to speak.\\nIt's only by way of\\nunpredictable sensory input\\nthat you can do that.\\nSo if you're a coach,\\nor you're working with people\\nwho are very high level performers,\\ndo you want them to stand\\non one leg and spin around\\nand then do what they're doing?\\nNot necessarily.\\nWhat you want to do\\nis try and get them into brain states\\nthat are different than the\\nbrain states that they're in\\nwhen they normally enter their practice.\\nThe liminal state between\\nsleep and waking, excuse me,\\nthe liminal state between sleep and waking\\nis a very powerful one\\nfor accessing creativity.\\nMany people access ideas\\nas they're waking up in the morning,\\nthey have great insights,\\nother people while strolling in nature.\\nI don't think it's the\\nstrolling or the waking up.\\nI think it's the lack of,\\nas we call it top-down\\nregulation on rules.\\nYou are able to access\\ncombinations of neural maps\\nthat are unusual.\\nSo you can play with this a little bit.\\nA lot of people throughout history\\nhave used compounds,\\ndrugs, to do this, right?\\nGreat writers would get\\ndrunk and then try and write\\nor wake up and they would,\\nthe amount of self-abuse\\nthat people including\\nathletes and creatives\\nput themselves through to try and capture\\nthese windows of cognitive\\nability is pretty intense.\\nAnd I don't think that's a good idea.\\nI think one should be an explorer\\nand try and find these cognitive states\\nin ways that are non-destructive.\\nI'm starting to sound like\\nmy mother, with all this.\\n[audience laughing]\\nHeel flips on lock. No kick flips.\\nNext question.\\n[audience laughing]\\n[scattered applause]\\nThere's some skateboarders\\nin the audience;\\nmy first non-biologic family.\\nThere's some amazing\\nskateboarders in this audience\\nand I'm not going to be the one\\ndoing a kick flip anytime soon,\\nbut they're great to have.\\nOne of the reasons we built the podcast\\nwith the help of the great Mike Blabac\\nis because I learned a long time ago\\nthat if you want things done right,\\nand you want to do them\\noutside the lane lines,\\nand you want to have control\\nover how things come across,\\nyou do it with skateboarders,\\n'cause I didn't come from a\\ncommunity where, you know,\\nI didn't have parents at my sports games\\nand things like that\\nso, thanks to the\\nskateboarders and the misfits\\nand the those folks.\\n\\\"Do you have any tips on\\nhow to improve memory?\\\"\\nYes, Ron Vered. Yes!\\nOkay.\\nThis is a wild literature and I love it\\nand it's changing the\\nway that I do things.\\nI thought that to remember things\\nyou're supposed to get\\nreally, really excited,\\nreally focused, and remember them.\\nGuess what? That's not how you do it.\\nThere are data,\\nand there are stories going\\nback to medieval times\\nthat they used to teach kids things\\nand then throw them in the river.\\nThere's a beautiful Annual\\nReview of Neuroscience\\nwritten by the late James McGaugh,\\na brilliant researcher who\\ntaught me that, in this review.\\nAnd it turns out that if you\\nwant to remember something\\nyou want to spike adrenaline\\nafter you acquired that\\ninformation, after!\\nThat means the double\\nespresso and the ice bath\\nafter you study for\\nmath, immediately after.\\nAnd you think about this, you know,\\nthat makes perfect sense, right?\\nThink about the one trial learning\\nthat nobody wants to experience,\\nwhich is a car accident\\nor some traumatic thing.\\nYou didn't get the spike\\nof adrenaline first.\\nYou got the spike of adrenaline after.\\nSo again, you know,\\nI discourage the use\\nof excessive stimulants\\nor you know, anything like that.\\nBut if you're going to try\\nand remember information,\\nyou need to get your brain and body\\ninto a high autonomic arousal state.\\nLiterally you need to deploy\\nadrenaline into your system\\nafter you have made the attempt\\nto learn some information.\\nSo much so that if you\\ngive people a beta blocker\\nafter learning emotional information,\\nthey don't learn it as well.\\nIncredible, just incredible\\ndata in animals and humans.\\nThis is the beautiful work\\nof Larry Cahill at UC Irvine\\nand James McGaugh.\\nSo that's how I would focus\\non remembering things better.\\nAnd it's also true that\\nif you tell yourself\\nthat something's really important to you,\\nyou'll be able to learn it better.\\nIf you meet people and\\nthey tell you their name\\nand you forget it two seconds later, well,\\nyou should probably be\\nthinking, and now I do this,\\nI meet people and I think,\\n\\\"Okay, what terrible\\nthing did this person do?\\\"\\nJust try and spike my adrenaline\\nor something like that.\\nIt's a terrible trick, but\\nhaven't figured out a better way,\\nbut that's actually one\\ndata-supported way to do that.\\nEasily a dozen or more studies\\nin humans on that very topic.\\n\\\"How do you manage\\nsocial media addiction?\\\"\\nPaul.\\nOi, well we should be careful\\nwith the use of the word addiction\\nbecause here, I think\\nit's entirely appropriate.\\nWhen you are engaging in\\na behavior over, and over. and over again,\\nand you're thinking to yourself,\\n\\\"This isn't even that interesting,\\\"\\nyou're officially addicted.\\nThat's the litmus test for addiction.\\nNot, \\\"This feels so good.\\\"\\nPeople talk about the\\ndopamine hits of social media.\\nThose only come at the beginning,\\nbut then when you find yourself scrolling,\\nyou're like, \\\"What am I doing?\\\"\\nMaybe it's that narrow visual aperture;\\nyou're a hypnotized chicken,\\nbut maybe also you are\\nseeking more dopamine hits\\nbecause guess what?\\nThat dopamine wave pool is depleted,\\nat least for that activity.\\nIt is true that dopamine,\\nyou have a baseline and\\nthen you have peaks on,\\non that ride on that baseline.\\nI do think that we can have\\ndopamine for one behavior,\\nand not for another,\\nbut it's a generalized phenomenon.\\nSo how do you manage it?\\nYou have to stop seeking\\nwithin social media.\\nAnd so I've taken on the\\npractice of turning off my phone\\nfor a couple hours each day.\\nIt's incredibly hard.\\nPeople get really upset too, by the way,\\ncause if you haven't noticed\\nthese tethers that people expect.\\nWe recorded a podcast\\nrecently and it, so I,\\nI don't want to go into\\ntoo much depth now,\\nabout attachment and grief.\\nAnd, you know, we all have a map now,\\nyou know, you understand\\nwhat the maps are,\\nof space, time, and a dimension called\\ncloseness to everyone that we know\\nspace, where they are,\\ntime, when they are,\\ndead, alive, when will I\\nsee them again et cetera,\\nand closeness.\\nAnd the phone has allowed us to tap into\\nspace, time, and this closeness map,\\nwhich define all our attachments,\\non a very regular basis.\\nSo you can understand why\\nit's so valuable to people.\\nYou know, the plane lands\\nand everyone's texting.\\nThe planes, take off, everyone's texting.\\nIt's like, \\\"Where are you?\\\"\\nWell, the plane's in the air,\\nthere's this thing called flight tracker.\\nNo one cares about that anymore.\\nYou want to hear from the person.\\nSo I do think that,\\nI used to do an every odd hour of the day\\nmy phone was off,\\nand like half the relationships\\nin my life disappeared.\\nThey couldn't talk, they\\ncouldn't tolerate it.\\nI loved it, but I loved them too.\\nSo I would say take breaks.\\nAnd I would say at least an hour.\\nAnd if you find yourself excited\\nto get back on the phone,\\nthat excitement, that\\nis the dopamine system.\\nSo you can kind of learn\\nwhere it is for you.\\nBut if you find yourself\\nscrolling mindlessly\\nand it's not doing anything for you,\\nyou are driving that wave pool\\ndown, down, down, down, down,\\nso hopefully that analogy will help.\\nIt's weird to call myself Dr. Huberman.\\nIn my business if you refer to\\nyourself in the third person,\\nit means you're officially a narcissist.\\n[audience laughing]\\nSo I'm just going to start with,\\n\\\"Were you nervous tonight and if so,\\nwhat did you do to prepare?\\\"\\nBrianne, you saw my\\nnervousness, didn't you?\\nNo, the, I asked myself that question.\\nI was excited, and I think\\nI'm good at lying to myself\\nand telling myself that autonomic arousal\\nthat might be nervousness is excitement.\\nBut in truth, I wasn't, I\\nwas and am really excited\\nto tell you all these\\nstories and about biology.\\nI know this might sound\\nlike a little bit of a line,\\nbut I actually don't feel myself as a,\\nlike a person when I do the\\npodcast or I do this stuff.\\nI took a walk before I got\\nhere and I have to be careful.\\nThere are only two\\ntopics that make me cry.\\nOne is talking about my bulldog.\\nThe other is talking\\nabout my graduate advisor.\\nSo I have to be very careful,\\nbut I took a walk and I\\nimagined that they were here\\nand, I know, and don't make me cry.\\nLex Friedman made me cry on a podcast\\nand it was really unfair.\\nAnd he was like digging and digging and\\nthere are a few people in the\\naudience that know Costello.\\nAnd it's like, you know,\\nand I just kept thinking to\\nmyself before coming in here,\\nlike, you know, I love\\nthem and miss them and I,\\nCostello would be entirely\\nbored with this whole thing.\\nSo I distracted myself a\\nbit and not so nervous.\\nI do get nervous about\\nthings, sure, I'm human.\\nBut when it comes to biology,\\nI think I still feel like that little kid\\nwho just wants to tell you\\nall this stuff, you know, so,\\nyou know, I can't help it.\\n\\\"Is learning from failure\\nequal to learning from success?\\nIs one more efficient than the other?\\\"\\nRachel, thanks for your question.\\nWell, on a trial-by-trial basis,\\nwe know that when you fail at an attempt,\\non the next attempt,\\nyour forebrain is in a\\nposition to engage better.\\nAnd this makes total sense, right?\\nYou feel that frustration [alarm buzzer]\\nand you want to get the next one, right?\\nWell, you're harboring,\\nor I should say funneling\\nmore neural resources,\\nyour focus, that aperture tightens.\\nNow you have to be mindful of that too,\\nbecause when you have a\\nfailure and then you're like,\\nyou're going to hit the bulls.\\nI'm thinking about a dart board,\\n'cause I'm terrible at darts, you know,\\nsober I'm terrible at darts.\\nI don't even drink.\\nSo that next trial,\\npart of the problem is,\\nis that focus can narrow\\nso much that you can start\\nto lose access to information\\nthat might help you.\\nIf you were just to relax a little bit\\nand dilate that focus a\\nlittle bit, but in general,\\non a trial-by-trial basis focus is the cue\\nthat your nervous system\\nis going to be positioned\\nto learn better on the next trial.\\nNow in terms of life experiences, gosh,\\nI wish for everyone fewer\\nfailures and more successes,\\nbut you know, failures keep you humble.\\nAnd I've had a lot of 'em.\\nI mean, if people ever\\nwanted and they, you know,\\nI'd be happy to tell you about, I mean,\\nI've made a ton of mistakes\\nin life, a ton of mistakes.\\nSome of those were\\nmistakes of persistence,\\nlike dumb decisions.\\nI kept like, \\\"It's going to\\nchange. It's going to change.\\\"\\nAnd it's clearly never going to change.\\nAnd then some were failures of misjudgment\\nabout other people or situations.\\nAnd a lot of them were just plain failures\\nlike the experiment didn't work,\\nor the, it just wasn't the right thing.\\nAnd you try and reframe those.\\nI do think that we owe it to ourselves\\nand to the people that we know\\nto try and generate\\nsome wins here and there\\nand try and help other\\npeople generate wins.\\nYou know, in running a lab over the years\\nand I still do,\\nyou realize that you want your\\nstudents to publish a paper\\nand feel that success pretty early\\nso that they can experience,\\nA, how much work it is\\nso they pick problems wisely,\\nbut, B, so they can feel that,\\nlike, \\\"Oh, I can do this.\\\"\\nAnd I think that, you know,\\nthis gets into the psychological as well.\\nI think that yes, failures\\nhelp, but successes help.\\nAnd there, I think, you know,\\nI function best in a team.\\nAnd I think that for those of you that are\\nfeel like you're fighting\\nsome challenge alone,\\nI do think that there are\\ngreat resources to be had\\nin trying to access other, you know,\\nother people as sources of support.\\nI think that that's a great tool.\\nThere's this whole literature,\\nscientific literature,\\naround social connection\\nand how that can help us\\nreframe motivation and goals.\\nAnyway, maybe that's a topic\\nto expand on another time.\\nBut failure is important\\non a trial, trial by basis.\\nPeople who\\ndon't experience enough wins\\nfor a long period of time,\\nthe brain is a prediction\\nmachine after all\\nand they start to predict failure\\nso takes a bit more work to\\nwedge oneself out of that.\\n\\\"When are you going to\\nstart training jiu-jitsu?\\nLex made me ask.\\\"\\nRyan Flores.\\nOkay. Here's the story with that.\\nLex said, \\\"Do you want to try jiu-jitsu?\\\"\\nI said, \\\"Sure.\\\"\\nLex said,\\n\\\"Okay, it'll be great to\\nshow people beginner's mind.\\\"\\nI said, \\\"Sure.\\\"\\nWe went and did a jiu-jitsu class.\\nHe was very nice; nice,\\nnice, Russian, nice.\\nLike, \\\"Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.\\\"\\nThen he puts it on the internet\\nwith me in a rear naked,\\nhim putting me in a rear naked choke,\\nit was actually Lex Friedman\\nchoking out Andrew Huberman,\\nThere, I just talked about\\nmyself in the third person,\\ndammit, edit that one.\\nI have not had the time for jiu-jitsu.\\nI like my ears the way they are, you know.\\nHave you ever seen these\\npeople that do jiu-jitsu?\\nTheir ears literally look like\\nstumps.

university,\\nhe took the time that we were\\nsupposed to meet in my office\\nand talk about data, he\\nasked if he could take a nap.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAnd he gave a great talk that afternoon.\\nSo there you go.\\nI do think you have to take\\ncontrol of your schedule\\nand do those things.\\nAnd I hope that helps.\\nAnd then of course,\\nfor some people, exercise and\\nso on is the way they reset.\\n\\\"What research or work are you doing\\nor that your colleagues are doing\\nthat you're most excited about lately?\\\"\\nGlen, yeah.\\nOne project in particular,\\nI hope this paper gets accepted soon,\\nit's been out for review forever\\nand so if the reviewers\\nare in the audience,\\nplease just tell us one\\nway or the other, you know?\\nWe did a very large scale\\nstudy during the pandemic,\\nwe meaning David Spiegel and I,\\nand an amazing PhD named Melis\\nshe now has two last names, excuse me,\\nBalban, Yilmaz Balban.\\nAnd Melis\\nwe essentially equipped people\\nwith remote monitoring devices\\nand measured sleep and\\nheart rate variability\\nand a bunch of stress and\\nbunch of other things.\\nAnd we gave them\\na very brief set of breathing protocols\\nand it turns out\\nthat this thing that I'm talking\\nabout a lot on the podcast,\\nthese days of this double\\ninhale, long exhale,\\nthe so-called, \\\"physiological sigh,\\\"\\nwas the most effective breathing practice\\nfor allowing people to control\\ntheir heart rate variability,\\nreduce overall heart\\nrate, access better sleep,\\nand these were extremely short protocols.\\nSo I'm very excited about this.\\nI didn't discover physiological sighs.\\nI love the idea\\nthat people can do a very\\nbrief protocol, once a day,\\nmaybe even just while\\nwalking down the street\\nor in the moment\\nand actually learn to control\\nthat autonomic seesaw better.\\nSo I'm very excited about that.\\nAnd then we are gearing\\nup to do some studies\\non people who have more\\nsevere forms of anxiety\\nand panic attack, using\\nmainly respiration,\\nbut also looking at some of these eye,\\nvision-related ways of\\ncontrolling the nervous system.\\nI love that stuff.\\nIf I keep talking about it,\\nI'm going to give you a data presentation\\nso I'm going to turn around.\\n\\\"How does dopamine\\nfactor into neuroplasticity if at all?\\\"\\nColin, great question.\\nIt's a very strong trigger of plasticity,\\nso much so in fact that\\nthere's some work that shows\\nif you stimulate with an electrode,\\nthe brain area that releases dopamine,\\nand you pair that with anything,\\nanything, even just like\\nan eight kilohertz tone,\\n[vocalizes a high tone]\\nthe brain remaps and it's like,\\n\\\"Oh, I love that eight kilohertz tone.\\\"\\nRemember dopamine is\\ndumb, and is just dumb.\\nAnd it is just, you\\nknow, it's like Costello\\nwhen he sits this dog,\\nI could hang a rope from a tree.\\nThis dog was so lazy he wouldn't\\ncross a room for a steak.\\nYou had to give the steak to him,\\n[audience laughing]\\nbut it would run across a field.\\nHe would run and jump on\\nand hold onto that rope,\\nand he would sometimes\\nbite through his lip\\nwith like blood dripping down.\\nAnd I was like, \\\"Oh my gosh,\\\"\\nit was like breaking my heart.\\nHe loved every sit, that's\\ndopamine; turns us into idiots.\\nHe was as smart about what\\nhe needed to be smart about.\\nDopamine.\\nSo if you trigger dopamine\\nrelease with Ritalin, Adderall,\\nto a lesser extent L-Tyrosine,\\nand certainly please don't do this,\\nbut cocaine, amphetamine,\\nwhatever you're doing\\nseems super interesting.\\nIt's true. And that's why\\nit's such a slippery slope.\\nIt makes anything you're doing\\nseem interesting and important.\\nAnd actually I'll use this\\nas an opportunity to say\\nsomething about the\\npsychedelic thing earlier.\\nOne of the issues with MDMA,\\nit's a very unusual brain\\nstate: it's high dopamine,\\nhigh serotonin, completely\\nsynthetic compound.\\nThere are other things in\\nthere that it does as well.\\nOne of the problems with people I see\\nwith the problem with\\npeople just taking MDMA,\\njust at a basic level,\\nis that if you're not pushing that\\ntowards some therapeutic\\noutcome, music sounds amazing.\\nEverything feels and sounds amazing,\\nbut it's a very neurochemically,\\nyou know, severe state.\\nSo that's why I think\\nif people are going to\\nexplore those things,\\ndo it as part of\\none of the university-supported\\nclinical trials.\\nOne of the reas-\\nthose drugs make everything\\nseem interesting,\\neven stuff that's not\\nterribly interesting.\\nNow they also have\\nthe potential for trauma healing capacity.\\nThese are the MAPS studies and so on.\\nSo you have to be very careful\\nwith what you pair with dopamine\\nand what you pair dopamine with.\\nAnd for those of you\\nthat are high sensation\\nseeking, novelty seeking,\\nand everything's interesting to you,\\nand you want more, and\\nmore, and more, experiences,\\nI, you basically have a\\neight cylinder car in you\\nand you need to be very careful\\nhow you drive that thing.\\nLike any high performance automobile,\\nit's going to spend more time in the shop,\\n[audience laughing]\\nso learn to drive appropriately.\\n\\\"What advice can you\\noffer to future scientists\\nwho want to make an impact like you have?\\\"\\nRyan O'Boyle, get tenure first.\\nNo, I'm kidding.\\nSo I have this weird history in science\\nand I'm not looking for sympathy here,\\nbut my undergraduate\\nadvisor, who I adored,\\nhe's like a father to me,\\nmy graduate advisor,\\nand my postdoc advisor,\\nwho I also adored, all three of them died:\\nsuicide, cancer, cancer, really young.\\nSo the joke in my field is\\nyou don't want me to work for you.\\nBut in all seriousness,\\nall three of them had a\\nreally morbid sense of humor,\\nall amazing people,\\nbut it is this kind of\\nweird curse that I've had.\\nSo what scientists, you\\nknow, what advice, you know,\\nwell, Ben Barres,\\nthe late Ben Barres died\\nof pancreatic cancer,\\nan amazing individual.\\nThey're actually making a\\ndocumentary about Ben's life.\\nHe's transgendered. He\\nwas a totally irreverent.\\nHe said whatever he thought.\\nHe offended everybody.\\nHe was awesome. Brilliant too.\\nBen and I had a conversation\\nas he was dying.\\nI recorded a lot of conversations with him\\nand I told him I was interested in doing\\npublic-facing education.\\nAnd he said,\\n\\\"Well, you're tenured now and,\\npeople are going to be upset,\\nand they're not going to like it,\\nand your colleagues are\\nprobably going to hate it\\nso whatever you do and\\nyou better make it good.\\\"\\nAnd I was like, \\\"Wow, that\\ndoesn't really help much, Ben.\\\"\\nAnd he said,\\n\\\"You know, you seem to\\nhave a compulsion for it.\\\"\\nSo, he was right.\\nI think that if you are\\nexcited about science,\\nand sharing what you know, then do that.\\nAnd even if it seems super nerdy,\\nI mean, there are these ento-\\nI think they call\\nthemselves entomologists,\\nthe insect people,\\nthey, I mean they make insects\\nseem really, really cool.\\nAnd if you are excited about\\nspindle kinetics or whatever,\\nyou know, tell people\\nabout it, I really mean it.\\nI think that the one caveat is that\\nI do think it's important\\nto get a formal, rigorous\\ntraining in it first.\\nI think that you'll go further\\nand faster in the long run.\\nAnd there's some amazing people out there.\\nThere's a postdoc at Stanford.\\nI think his name is Ben Rein,\\nI think if you shorten it up on Instagram,\\nit's actually brain,\\nbrein, 'cause he works out\\nhe talks about brain science\\nso that's why it's weird:\\nB B R E I N.\\nHe does a great job.\\nAnd he's a really good example of someone\\nwho's still on the ascent with his career,\\ndoing serious science, and\\ndoing science communication.\\nBut you have to be careful,\\nit's time consuming.\\nLook, you, people will\\ndislike you for whatever.\\nI made the mistake once of\\nsaying that I eat butter.\\nApparently that's a sin on the internet.\\nI like little bits of\\nactually like a lot of butter,\\nbut try and eat little bits of butter.\\nBut somehow it's like,\\nthere's this idea that\\nI eat sticks of butter.\\nSo you have to be careful.\\n[audience laughing]\\nLike, I mean, the things I've\\nheard, I heard I was dead.\\nThat was cool.\\nSo you have to be careful\\nand remember everything\\nis stamped into the,\\nthe cloud now and the metaverse\\nor whatever it's called.\\nSo I would say, here are\\nthe rules that we have\\nat the podcast and on\\nhere's the rules that\\nI created for myself.\\nI truly don't do it for me.\\nI do it 'cause I think\\npeople want to hear about it,\\nbut I've been telling myself\\nthat since I was six years old.\\nThe other thing is never, ever, ever do it\\njust for your own gratification.\\nYou should really try and think,\\n\\\"Is anyone going to get\\nanything useful out of this,\\npotentially?\\\"\\nThat's the goal.\\nIf you're doing that,\\nit'll work out for you.\\nIf you are thinking about\\nhow to get followers\\nor something like that,\\nit ain't going to work out.\\nThat's my advice.\\n\\\"Is age 66 too old for neuroplasticity?\\\"\\nNo, no, I'll cut myself off,\\n\\\"to begin learning again?\\\"\\nSandra Trazzare, no!\\nDid I pronounce that right?\\nThank you, Sandra.\\nNo, Richard Feynman, the\\ngreat Richard Feynman,\\ntaught himself to draw later in life.\\nHe was also really into flotation tanks.\\nDid you know that?\\nYeah, he was also into bongo drumming\\nnaked on the roof at Caltech.\\nRichard Feynman, you\\nknow, did so many things\\nthat would get most people fired nowadays.\\nHe's just lucky he was alive when he was.\\nYou can absolutely learn\\nat 66 and way beyond.\\nThere's an amazing study\\nfrom Rusty Gage's lab at the\\nSalk Institute years ago,\\nshowing that even people\\nwho are very late in life,\\nterminally ill in fact,\\nare still producing new neurons\\nin the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.\\nThese people that were gracious enough\\nto allow researchers to\\ninject them with dyes\\nthat would label these neurons\\nfor analysis postmortem, after they died.\\nAbsolutely you can learn.\\nWhat's harder is focus.\\nOftentimes what's harder is sleep as well,\\nbut the same mechanisms apply.\\nThere's no evidence whatsoever\\nthat neuroplasticity\\ndisappears at any stage\\ndespite what Hubel and\\nWiesel told the BBC.\\n\\\"How do you tackle\\nreading research papers?\\nDo you have a specific strategy?\\\"\\nAnne Hun, yes I do.\\nI do. I take notes on everything.\\nI try and so I there's four\\nquestions that we teach students\\nand that I think that I use.\\nThe first one is:\\n\\\"What's the question they're asking,\\nmajor and more specific?\\\"\\nSecond is: \\\"What did they do?\\nWhat are they, like\\nmethods-wise, what did they do?\\\"\\nYou don't have to know all\\nthe details in the methods\\nnecessarily, but be\\nversed in those methods,\\nbut you have to kind of understand like,\\nare they looking at mice?\\nAre they looking at humans?\\nIs this a, you know, did they have people\\nin two different conditions or just one?\\nYou have to understand what did they do,\\nthen you ask, \\\"What did they find?\\\"\\nAnd then the last question\\nis the most important one\\nand you should write down\\nthe answer to this is:\\n\\\"What did they conclude?\\\"\\nAnd then you look back\\nat the first question\\nand you go,\\n\\\"Did they actually answer that question,\\nor is it something unrelated?\\\"\\nAnd those four questions\\nare essentially the way\\nthat I parse each paper.\\nLearning to parse papers\\nis tricky for the podcast.\\nI use the telephone.\\nI call people and I badger\\nthem and I ask them, you know,\\n\\\"Like who's doing the really\\ngood work in this area?\\\"\\nAnd I spend a lot of hours doing it.\\nAnd then the best way to remember science\\nis to tell someone about it.\\nSo before each podcast I'll\\ncall someone and be like,\\n\\\"Hey, did you know\\nthat they used to throw\\nkids in the river?\\\"\\nAfter, I do this, and my\\nsister, my poor sister,\\nand she's like, \\\"Yeah.\\\"\\nMy sister, by the way,\\ndoes not watch the podcast.\\nI, she's a therapist.\\nAnd she's like,\\n\\\"Hey, I learned this amazing\\nbreathing technique.\\\"\\nI was like,\\n\\\"Oh yeah, really? Tell me about it.\\\"\\nAnd it's like, someone else is there.\\nI'm like, \\\"You know, I have a podcast.\\\"\\nShe's like, \\\"I don't like your podcast.\\\"\\nYou know, it's older\\nsister, it's older sister.\\nIt's, she's not lying.\\n\\\"What is your favorite\\nsauce, condiment, seasoning?\\nSauce.\\nThere's one in every audience.\\nI like the spicy stuff.\\nWe've been fermenting\\nour own food at home.\\nIt's kind of cool.\\nYou put the cabbage and the stuff\\nin the little ceramic thing outside,\\nand then it, it goes\\n[popping]\\nIt makes this amazing sound.\\nAnd then you can like\\nmake your own sauerkraut and you know,\\nwith peppers and like\\nfermenting that stuff,\\nit's really good.\\nOkay.\\nThey're telling me one more\\nquestion so we'll do two.\\n\\\"What's most important from your ADH, ah.\\\"\\nGabriel, a lot of questions about ADHD,\\nfor people on medication\\nor not on medication,\\nso I'll answer both.\\nFor people on medication,\\nI think work with somebody really good\\nwho's willing to work with you\\nto allow you to find that\\nminimal effective dose,\\nand also timing that dose.\\nOne of the key things that we know now\\nis that from that waking\\nup point in your morning\\nuntil about eight or nine hours later,\\nwe've sort of named that\\nphase one of the day\\nfor lack of a better naming protocol.\\nThe systems that release cortisol,\\ndopamine, and epinephrine,\\nare essentially more\\neffective at producing those\\nthan they are in the\\nlater periods of the day.\\nWhich makes sense if you think about\\nthe way that the autonomic\\nnervous system works, et cetera.\\nSo there's an important question\\nthat I can't answer for you,\\nbut you can answer for you,\\nwhich is if you're using\\nRitalin, Adderall, Vyvanse,\\nthese things that enhance\\ndopaminergic transmission,\\nModafinil, Armodafinil, by the way,\\nfor the people in the audience like me,\\nwho didn't go to college when\\nthese things were all in use,\\nthe numbers of people\\nthat use these compounds,\\non and off prescription, is astronomical.\\nIt's incredible.\\nI didn't realize it.\\nI think something like\\n80% of college students\\nuse these at some point.\\nIncredible, 'cause they put you\\ninto a narrow aperture\\ntunnel of concentration.\\nSo you want to, with a\\nphysician's support of course,\\nto help, get permission or not,\\nto figure out what time of\\nday to take your medication.\\nNow for people who are not on medication,\\nI'll just go right back\\nto what I said earlier,\\nwhich is that you can train focus,\\nbut it feels terrible to train it.\\nIt is hard.\\nAgain there are these large\\nscale studies in China\\nand elsewhere of people\\nliterally teaching themselves,\\nand yes, they blink, although less often,\\nto focus their vision on a narrow aperture\\nand to really battle\\nthrough that agitation,\\nstress, and learn how to keep their focus.\\nNow focus will drift, right?\\nFocus is not a constant; focus will drift,\\nand you pop out of focused states\\nand then refocus, and\\npop out, and refocus.\\nThat's something that you can train up.\\nI've heard from many people\\nwho have managed to train\\nthemselves off medication\\nor to lower doses of medication,\\nand look, some people can't do that.\\nThey absolutely have to maintain\\ntheir standard medication protocols.\\nThis is a larger discussion, obviously,\\nas it relates to ADHD.\\nWe're going to do another episode on ADHD\\nbecause the data are\\ncoming out so so fast.\\n\\\"What future episodes\\nare in the pipeline?\\\"\\nDavid Nguyen. Okay, thank\\nyou for that question.\\nWe have one on grief.\\nWe have an amazing episode with\\na guy from the Rockefeller University\\non the, this is,\\nam I allowed to say it's going\\nto be my favorite episode?\\nI love all the guests,\\nbut this episode just blew me away.\\nIt's on the relationship\\nbetween language,\\nspeech, dance, and music.\\nAnd I have no musical talent\\nand I'm not a very good dancer.\\nSo that's being generous.\\nAmazing interplay between those things,\\nexercise in the brain, OCD,\\nbulimia, binge-eating disorder,\\nPeter Attia's coming on.\\nHe'll teach us about everything\\nmedicine, and longevity.\\nAnd I'm kind of blanking at the moment.\\nDavid Anderson from Caltech\\non aggression and emotional states.\\nAmazing.\\nAnd then there are a number of people,\\nLisa Feldman Barrett, or Barrett Feldman.\\nI always get it backwards.\\nSorry, Lisa, on emotions in the brain.\\nAnd really we do take suggestions\\nabout who to bring on the\\npodcast very seriously.\\nWhat we're mostly looking for\\nare the people that no one else has heard,\\nthat people haven't heard of,\\nwho are not going on podcasts every week\\nand that people should\\nabsolutely hear from.\\nAnd then I will tell you,\\nthey're going to kill me for saying this,\\nbut I'm going to do it anyway,\\nwe have some short series coming up\\nwith expert professionals.\\nI'm going to do a short series on trauma.\\nAnd my hope for this series\\nis that you'll actually get to\\nsee an exquisitely\\nskilled trauma therapist,\\ntake someone through, excuse me,\\nI seem so excited I'm spitting\\non the audience, excuse me.\\nSo it, to take someone\\nthrough actual trauma therapy.\\nThis isn't staged.\\nThis is somebody who's actually\\nin a point of near\\nsuicidal grief and trauma,\\ntaking them through it in\\nthe course of the podcast,\\nas people can see what this\\nprocess actually entails.\\nThat's a very meaningful project to me\\nfor a number of reasons\\nso we're really excited about that.\\nAnd you know, to be\\nhonest, I feel like there's\\njust such a treasure trove\\nof information out there\\nI just want to grab it all,\\nand tell you all about it,\\nuntil, I always say, \\\"If nothing\\nelse, I'll cure insomnia.\\\"\\nSo, the, yeah.\\n[audience applauding vigorously]\\nThank you. Appreciate it.\\n[applause continuing]\\nThank you so much for your time.\\nI really appreciate everyone\\ncoming out on a weekday\\nand I'd be remiss if I didn't say,\\nThank you for your interest in

life.\\n- I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm\\na professor of neurobiology\\nand ophthalmology at\\nStanford School of Medicine.\\nThis podcast is separate\\nfrom my teaching and\\nresearch roles at Stanford.\\nIt is however, part of\\nmy desire and effort\\nto bring you zero cost\\nto consumer information\\nabout science and science related tools\\nto the general public.\\nAnd keeping with that theme,\\nI'd like to thank the\\nsponsors of today's podcast.\\nOur first sponsor is InsideTracker.\\nInsideTracker is a\\npersonalized nutrition platform\\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\\nto help you better understand your body\\nand help you reach your health goals.\\nI've long been a believer in\\ngetting regular blood tests\\nand the simple reason for that\\nis that so many of the factors\\nthat impact our immediate and\\nlongterm health and wellbeing\\ncan only be analyzed from blood.\\nAnd now with the advent\\nof modern DNA tests,\\nyou can get additional\\nlayers of information\\nthat can really support your understanding\\nabout what's going on deep\\nunder the hood, so to speak\\ninside your body and brain\\nand what to do about it.\\nAnd I think that's really\\nwhere InsideTracker\\nsets itself apart from\\nother similar tests.\\nWhat InsideTracker\\noffers is, first of all,\\nthey make the tests very easy.\\nThey can come to your home to\\ntake your blood and DNA test\\nor you can go to a\\ntesting center nearby you.\\nThen you get the information back\\nand rather than just getting information\\nabout whether or not the\\nlevels of various things\\nare high or low,\\nyou also get to find\\nout what to do about it.\\nSo it offers directives\\nrelated to nutrition,\\nto exercise and so forth.\\nIt's really allow you to be in control\\nof your overall health,\\nboth where you are now\\nand its long-term trajectory.\\nWith InsideTracker, they\\nalso have something which is\\nit can give you a readout\\nof your inner age.\\nThey have something\\ncalled the inner age test\\nthat really compares your biological age\\nto your chronological age,\\nsomething that's of extreme\\nimportance and interest\\nbecause it has to do with\\nlifespan or predicted lifespan.\\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker\\nyou can visit insidetracker.com/huberman\\nand if you do that, you'll get 25% off\\nany of InsideTracker plans.\\nUse the code Huberman at checkout.\\nThat's insidetracker.com/huberman\\nto get 25% off\\nany of InsideTracker's plans\\nand use the code Huberman at checkout.\\nToday's episode is also\\nbrought to us by Helix Sleep.\\nHelix Sleep is a company that\\nmakes mattresses and pillows\\nideally suited to your sleep needs.\\nI've been sleeping on a Helix mattress\\nfor the last six months,\\nand I can honestly say\\nit's the best sleep that I've ever gotten.\\nHelix Sleep has a quiz that can match you\\nto the ideal mattress and pillows for you.\\nIt's a quiz that takes\\njust about two minutes,\\nasks you questions like do\\nyou tend to sleep on your side\\nor your back on your stomach?\\nOr maybe you don't know,\\nwhether or not you tend to wake up\\nfeeling too warm or too cold?\\nVarious questions about your sleep habits.\\nAt the end of that quiz,\\nit matches you to a specific mattress\\nthat's perfect for your sleep needs.\\nFor me, it matched me to the dusk, D-U-S-K\\nbecause I wanted a mattress\\nthat wasn't too firm nor too soft\\nand I really love the mattress.\\nAs I mentioned, I've been\\nsleeping terrifically well\\never since I got that mattress.\\nIf you're interested in\\nupgrading your mattress\\nyou can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,\\ntake their two minutes sleep quiz\\nand they'll match you\\nto a customized mattress\\nand then you'll get up to\\n$200 off all mattresses\\nand you'll get two free pillows.\\nThey have a 10 year warranty.\\nYou get to try it out for a\\nhundred nights, risk-free,\\nif you don't like it, they'll\\neven pick it up for free,\\ntake it away but I really think you will,\\nI certainly love mine.\\nAgain, if you're interested,\\nyou can go to helixsleep.com/huberman\\nfor up to $200 off\\nand two free pillows.\\nToday's episode is also\\nbrought to us by Theragun.\\nTheragun is a handheld\\npercussive therapy device\\nthat releases deep muscle tension.\\nI first learned about\\nTheragun on a lab expedition.\\nWe're actually headed out to ocean\\nwhere we were doing diving\\nwith great white sharks,\\nfilming those for our VR fear\\nexperiments in the laboratory\\nand it was very long days\\nof carrying Pelican cases,\\nthose are cases these hard\\nplastic cases with equipment,\\nit was diving, we were all\\nsore and tired all the time.\\nAnd someone had brought along a Theragun.\\nIt was the first time I had seen one\\nand pretty soon that thing\\nwas getting passed along\\nand became one of the more\\ncoveted devices on board.\\nEveryone wanted time with this\\nthing because it was great,\\nyou could give yourself\\na really terrific massage\\nand get deep into the\\ntissue and relieve soreness.\\nWhen I got back, I got a Theragun\\nand so I'm delighted that\\nthey're sponsoring the podcast.\\nWhether or not you want\\nto treat your muscles\\nbecause they're tense from working out\\nor whether or not you just\\nwant to release stress,\\nit's a terrific tool.\\nMany of you are familiar probably\\nwith professional massages\\nbut Theragun is\\ninteresting because you can\\nbasically give yourself\\na deep tissue massage,\\nanytime, anywhere, it's also very quiet.\\nIf you want to try Theragun,\\nyou can try it for 30 days.\\nThey start at only $199.\\nYou can go to\\ntheragun.com/huberman right now\\nand you can get your gen\\nfourth Theragun today,\\nthat's the one that I use or\\nanother one of their models.\\nThat's Theragun.com/huberman\\nto try Theragun.\\nThis episode marks the\\nbeginning of a new topic\\nfor the Huberman Lab Podcast.\\nAs many of you already know,\\nwe go deep into a\\nparticular topic over four,\\nsometimes even five episodes.\\nWe just closed out the\\nepisodes on hormones.\\nNow we are going to talk\\nabout how to optimize physical performance\\nand skill learning.\\nWe're going to look deep\\nat the science behind this\\nas well as specific practices.\\nIn fact, today, you're going\\nto hear about specific tools\\nthat you can use to improve\\nendurance and strength by up to,\\nI'm not making this up,\\nthree or four times your current capacity.\\nThis is based on studies\\nthat were done at Stanford\\nand are currently in use\\nby collegiate and professional teams.\\nIf you're not a professional\\nathlete or a serious athlete,\\nthat's okay.\\nThe topics, this month\\nand all the information\\nwe are going to cover\\nare going to make you\\na better recreational exerciser as well.\\nIf you're not an exerciser\\nand you're thinking\\nabout getting into that\\nor if you live in the Northern hemisphere\\nand you're just thinking\\nabout the beach this summer\\nor fat loss, muscle\\nbuilding, that sort of thing,\\nthis month we're going to\\ncover all of that as well.\\nThere's so much confusion out there\\nabout how to optimize fat\\nloss, muscle building,\\nimprovements in flexibility, for instance,\\nor skill learning.\\nI know many of you, aren't so focused\\non the cosmetic aspects\\nof physical exercise\\nbut are interested in\\nactual skill learning,\\nwe're going to talk about that too.\\nI want to just take a moment\\nto reflect on something\\nthat came up last episode.\\nIf you didn't see that episode,\\nthat's quite all right.\\nBut last episode, we were talking\\nabout the hormones,\\nadrenaline, and cortisol\\nand how to leverage those\\ntowards attention and learning\\nand there was a little bit of confusion\\nthat I want to clarify.\\nI mentioned an optimal\\nprotocol for learning\\nthat involves leveraging\\nadrenaline also called epinephrin\\nand it involved four steps.\\nThe four steps that I spelled out\\nwere to be calm and focused\\nwhile one is trying to acquire\\nor learn the new skill,\\ncognitive skill or motor skill,\\nthen to have a spike in adrenaline.\\nI mentioned ways to do that,\\nusing cold or breathing or other tools,\\nimmediately after the learning episode\\nthen to incorporate what I\\ncall non sleep deep rest,\\na 20 minute episode of a shallow\\nnap or some other protocol\\nlike NSDR, non sleep deep rest protocol\\nof which we always provide\\nlinks in the captions.\\nAnd then to try and optimize\\nsleep later that night\\nand the subsequent night.\\nSome of you heard this\\nand it sunk in right away\\nand it was straight forward.\\nOthers said, wait, I thought\\nfrom a previous episode\\neven before that, you said you're supposed\\nto do non sleep deep rest\\nimmediately after learning, no.\\nWe added another step,\\nthe logic still follows\\nthat you want to be calm\\nand focused during learning,\\nthen you want to spike\\nadrenaline at the end.\\nMost people get that backward,\\nthey're drinking too much coffee\\nor even taking nootropics and things,\\ntrying to be really\\nfocused while learning.\\nSome people are taking\\nAdderall recreationally\\nsomething I don't recommend,\\nthat's actually getting\\nthe whole process backwards\\nif you look at the data in the physiology.\\nYou want to spike adrenaline at the end\\nor immediately after a learning episode\\nand then non sleep deep rest\\nand then sleep itself, okay?\\nFour steps, hope that\\nclarifies things for you,\\nif you have any additional questions\\nplease put them in the\\ncomment section below.\\nOkay, so let's talk about\\nphysical performance.\\nThere are so many variables\\nto physical performance\\nand we can manage physical\\nperformance and skill learning\\nfrom a variety of contexts.\\nI made just a short list\\nof some of the things\\nthat come to mind that\\ncan powerfully impact\\nphysical performance and skill learning.\\nSome of them are what I\\nwould consider foundational.\\nThey allow you to show\\nup your current ability\\nand if you were to disrupt those,\\nyou would perform less well.\\nSo things like getting\\na good night's sleep,\\nthings like being properly hydrated,\\nthings like being well nourished,\\nwhatever that means to you.\\nI know some of you like\\nto exercise fasted,\\nsome of you prefer to\\nhave food in your stomach\\nor have eaten a couple hours before.\\nThere are supplements, there are drugs,\\nthere are different ways to breathe,\\nthere are so many tools related\\nto mindset, visualization,\\nthere are machines and devices,\\nit's just a vast space,\\nbut it's not infinite.\\nAnd there are a few things\\nin the list of things\\nthat can impact and even\\noptimize physical performance\\nand skill learning that\\nhave an outsized effect\\nthat any of you can use.\\nMany of them, most of them\\nare low to zero costs.\\nSo today we are going to\\nfocus on what I believe to be\\none of the most powerful tools\\nto improve physical performance\\nand skill learning and recovery\\nand we'll talk about why that's important\\nand that's temperature.\\nNow many of you might think,\\noh, well that's kind of boring,\\nI want to know about the\\nmagic pill that I can take\\nthat's going to allow\\nme to dunk a basketball\\nif I currently can't or I\\nwant to know about the thing\\nthat's going to let me\\nrun further and faster\\nis going to shed fat.\\nBelieve it or not, temperature\\nis the most powerful variable\\nfor improving physical\\nperformance and for recovery.\\nI would argue it's even\\nmore important than sleep\\nbecause temperature itself\\nis going to dictate how well\\nand when you sleep and the\\ndepth of your total recovery.\\nThere are two aspects to\\ntemperature of course,\\nthere's heat and there's cold.\\nWe are mainly going to focus on cold\\nas a way to buffer heat.\\nIn a previous podcast episode,\\nI talked all about growth hormone.\\nYou can find that episode about\\nfibroid and growth hormone\\nand how heat can be a powerful stimulus\\nfor increasing growth hormone\\nwhich is involved in\\ntissue repair and et cetera\\nand burn fat and improve\\nmetabolism in various ways.\\nHowever, cold I would argue\\nis even more powerful than heat as a tool\\nand I'm not just talking\\nabout putting ice packs\\non sore muscles or slightly\\nsprained limbs and ankles\\nand things of that sort.\\nWe're going to talk about cold\\nfrom the standpoint of thermal physiology.\\nThis is a literature that's\\nrich in scientific information\\nthat goes back very deep\\ninto the last century\\nwhere physiologists and\\nneuroscientists figured out\\nthat there are different\\ncompartments in your body\\nthat heat and cool you differently\\nand that you can leverage\\nthose in order to double\\nand as I mentioned before\\neven triple or quadruple your work output\\nboth strength, repetitions, and endurance.\\nSo this is not weak sauces that they say,\\nthis is the stuff that can\\nreally shift the needle quite a bit\\nand it's not just about well once,\\nit's about being able to\\nperform well and recover\\nfrom that performance so\\nthat you do even better\\nwhen you're not incorporating these tools\\non days where for instance,\\nyou can't access cold\\nor an ice pack or an ice bath\\nor things of that sort, okay?\\nSo we're going to cover cold,\\nwe're going to talk a little bit\\nabout the physiology of cold\\nand heat and how they work\\nbecause as you've probably\\nheard me say before\\nif you can understand some mechanism,\\nif you can just push yourself\\nthrough a little bit of new knowledge,\\ninto understanding a\\nlittle bit of mechanism\\nabout how you work, you'll\\nbe in a far better position\\nto implement the tools in the\\nbest and most flexible ways\\nfor your needs.\\nThis is why at the Huberman Lab Podcast,\\nI never ever do a just list of the things\\nthat you should do.\\nI don't believe in that,\\njust tell me what to do.\\nFirst, I tell you why\\nyou should do something.\\nWhat's the logical framework\\nthat it's grounded in\\nand then we distill that\\ndown to specific protocols.\\nFor those of you that are\\ntoo impatient for that,\\nthere are millions, if not billions\\nof other resources out\\nthere that will take you\\ninto the cul-de-sac of one\\nprotocol that will work\\nand then stop working or might\\nwork for you indefinitely,\\nthat's not how we work here.\\nThis is about really\\nunderstanding the mechanism\\nso that you can tweak\\nthings and modify things,\\nadjust the timing and the dosage of things\\nand really get the most out\\nof these tools and protocols.\\nEverything I'm going to talk about\\npertains to both endurance exercise\\nand strength and speed type exercise.\\nSo sprints, weightlifting, endurance work\\nand to some extent, flexibility\\nbut we're going to cover\\nflexibility in depth\\nas well as another feature\\nthat's not often talked about\\nwhich is suppleness or\\nsmoothness of movement\\nover different ranges of\\nmovement in a subsequent episode.\\nLet's start by talking about temperature.\\nWhat is temperature?\\nHow does temperature impact the body\\nand its ability to perform,\\nincluding learn new skills?\\nSo everyone probably remembers,\\nor has at least heard of\\nthe word homeostasis, right?\\nThat the body wants to remain\\nin a particular range of temperatures,\\nthat it doesn't like to\\nbe too hot or too cold.\\nAnd I want to emphasize from the outset\\nthat there are many mechanisms\\nthat are installed into us\\nby way of our evolutionary\\ndesign and our genome\\nmeaning we were just born\\nwith this stuff ready\\nto keep our body temperature\\nin a particular narrow range.\\nHeating up too much is just plain bad.\\nIt's not just bad for\\nphysical performance,\\nit's bad for all tissue health.\\nIf your brain heats up too\\nmuch, neurons start dying\\nand those neurons don't come back, okay?\\nYou may have heard about neurogenesis,\\nthe ability for the brain\\nto regenerate itself\\nor generate new neurons and adulthood,\\nthere's very little neurogenesis\\nexcuse me, in adulthood,\\neven after anytime after puberty really\\nand you don't want to lose neurons\\nin the central nervous system.\\nIf you get too hot, that'll happen.\\nIt's called hyperthermia, you\\nwant to avoid hyperthermia\\nand you have many mechanisms\\nthat are built into you to\\navoid becoming hyperthermic.\\nThe other thing that\\nhappens when we get too warm\\nis that we have in all of our cells,\\nwhat are called enzymes.\\nYou generally know if\\nsomething's an enzyme\\nbecause it ends in the\\nletters, A-S-E, right?\\nSo lipase is an enzyme\\nthat exists to digest fats.\\nYou have proteases that are\\nthere to digest proteins, right?\\nSo anytime you see A-S-E\\nchances are it's an enzyme.\\nEnzymes are proteins, and they\\nhave a particular structure\\nand their structure becomes\\nmodified when heat increases\\nand that's not good.\\nYou want their structure\\nto be of a particular type.\\nImagine a car with four wheels,\\nlet's just say the car is the enzyme.\\nIf it gets too hot, it's like\\ntwo of the wheels fall off\\nand that thing can't function.\\nSo one of the reasons\\nwhy the body and nature\\ngoes through so much effort\\nto build in mechanisms\\nto make sure that we don't become too warm\\nis because when we get to warm,\\nthese enzymes don't function,\\ncells stop functioning,\\nthey stop being able to generate energy,\\nthey stop being able to digest things,\\nyou stop being able to think\\nand eventually those cells\\nstart dying off entirely.\\nSo keeping temperature in a\\nparticular range is really good,\\nyou don't want to get too hot.\\nWe have much more flexibility\\nin terms of getting cold.\\nNow you don't want to\\nbecome hypothermic either.\\nYou can die from hypothermia\\njust like you can die from hyperthermia.\\nHowever that you have a\\nlot more range to be cold\\nthan you do to be too warm, okay?\\nAnd in general, the idea is\\nto keep the body and brain\\nin a particular range but\\nanytime we do anything,\\nour body temperature can shift.\\nSo for instance, if you were\\nto stand next to a campfire\\nor you were outside on a hot day,\\nvarious things would happen\\nto dump heat from your body.\\nIf you were outside on a cold day\\nor you were to get into a\\ncold shower or a cold lake,\\nvarious things would happen\\nto insulate heat within your body.\\nThis is all pretty straightforward\\nand obvious I realize.\\nNow, what are those things?\\nWell, there are a huge category of them.\\nWhen you get into cold water,\\nyou secrete adrenaline.\\nOn a hot day, if it's really\\nhot or in a very hot sauna\\nor in the hot desert,\\nyou will generate what are\\ncalled heat shock proteins\\nwhich will set off other sets of cascades,\\nmetabolic cascades, biological cascades.\\nBut the simplest way to think\\nabout this process is that\\nwhen we get cold, we\\ntend to vasoconstrict.\\nOur blood vessels tend to constrict\\nand we tend to push energy\\ntoward the core of our body\\nto preserve our core organs, okay?\\nSo our periphery, our hands\\nand our feet and our toes\\nand our legs become colder\\nand our core therefore can\\nmaintain blood to that area\\nand we are insulating our core.\\nConversely, when we heat up\\nour blood vessels vasodilate,\\nthey expand a bit and more\\nblood flows to our periphery\\nand more blood can move\\nthroughout the body generally\\nand we will perspire, we will\\nsweat, water will actually\\nget pulled out of the\\nblood to some extent,\\nmoved up through sweat glands\\nand will be brought to the skin surface\\nso that it can be dumped,\\nwe are dumping heat.\\nAnimals, as you know vary\\nin their capacity to sweat.\\nSome animals like camels\\nwon't start sweating at first\\nif they heat up, what\\nthey'll do is they'll spit,\\nthey'll dump heat by spitting, okay?\\nDogs pant, Castilla is\\noff to my left here,\\nhe pants when he gets\\ntoo warm, he can't sweat\\nor dogs can maybe sweat a little bit.\\nBut we can sweat and\\nyou've probably noticed\\nthat on a humid hot day,\\nyou'll feel much warmer\\njust walking or running than you would\\nwith the equivalent exercise or movement\\nthan you would on a cold day.\\nAnd some of you probably\\nknow this, but if you don't\\nthe reason is you sweat on a cold day,\\nbut because the air is dry typically,\\nyou will bring that sweat to the surface\\nand provided you're wearing clothes\\nthat allow some air to get\\nout away from the body,\\nso you're not wearing,\\nyou know, really tight,\\nyou know spandex type clothing\\nor something like that,\\nor, you know seal type\\nsaran wrap type clothing\\nthat sweat will evaporate\\noff into the dry atmosphere.\\nWhereas on a humid day,\\nthe reason you see people\\nin New York and Florida\\non a humid summer day\\nand they're like moving\\ntheir shirts off themselves\\nand you see people with, you know\\nbig sweat stains and back sweat stains\\nand all this kind of stuff\\nis because they're sweating\\nas they normally would, but it's humid\\nand so there is the humidity,\\nthe air doesn't allow transfer\\nof that sweat into the\\natmosphere as readily\\nand so you're hot, okay?\\nSo without the evaporation,\\nyou're going to be warmer.\\nSo we evaporate off sweat, we sweat\\nand we vasodilate when\\nwe want to dump heat.\\nWhen we want to maintain\\nheat, we vasoconstrict\\nand we tend to not sweat.\\nThe other thing that happens\\nis you'll get goosebumps.\\nSo-called goose pimples\\nthey're sometimes called.\\nThose are a throwback to the time\\nwhere we had fur over\\nmost, not all of our body.\\nAll mammals in the cold have a process\\nwhereby adrenaline is\\nreleased at low levels\\ntypically into the body,\\nthat adrenaline activates\\nwhat are called sympathetic fibers,\\nthey have nothing to do with sympathy,\\nthose little fibers, which are neurons,\\nthose fibers that what I'm\\nsaying are fibers are neurons,\\nnot clothing fibers,\\nreach up into the skin\\nso your whole body is covered\\nwith these little tiny neurons\\nthat reach up into the\\nskin and when we are cold,\\nthey actually mechanically\\ntake the hair follicle\\nand bend it up, it's a\\nprocess called pilo erection,\\nP-I-L-O erection, okay?\\nSo on a hot day, you\\nwant to dump heat, okay?\\nSo on a hot day, what would happen is\\nyou'd actually not see those goose pimples\\nbecause you want the hairs lying down\\nwhich actually you would think\\nthat might insulate you more\\nbut we'll actually let\\nmore heat dissipate out\\nthrough the skin.\\nOn a cold day, you get these\\ngoose pimples or goosebumps\\nwhich are really just\\nan ancient carry over\\nfrom the body's attempt to\\nmake hair stand up on end.\\nAnd when hair step stand up on end\\nand they're very close together\\nthat traps air in between\\nthem and actually creates\\na sort of insulated blanket of warm air.\\nIf you've ever seen an animal\\nlike a a Malamute or a Husky,\\nyou might think, oh that\\npoor thing on a hot day,\\nwhat does it do?\\nYou know, with all that hair?\\nWell, it can be warm so the\\nanimal will typically pant\\nand its hair will lay down,\\nwhich you might think would act\\nas more of a blanket, but on a cold day\\nwhat'll happen is they'll\\nbecome very puffy.\\nTheir hair will stand up on end\\nand that's actually trapping\\nheat between the hairs\\nand they're actually quite well insulated.\\nSo it's very important that\\nif you want to understand\\nhow you can leverage temperature\\nfor physical performance,\\nyou have to understand\\nthat you have vasoconstriction\\nto conserve heat,\\nvasodilation to dump heat,\\nthat you are sweating to dump heat,\\nand you have conservation of fluids\\nin order to preserve heat.\\nThat's the most important thing\\nin terms of understanding the mechanisms\\nof maintaining and dumping heat.\\nAnd now the most important\\nthing to understand is that\\nif you get too hot, not only\\ndo those enzymes stop working\\nbut your ability to contract\\nyour muscles stops, okay?\\nI'm going to repeat this\\nbecause it's vitally important.\\nATP is involved in the process\\nof generating muscle contractions,\\nit doesn't matter if\\nyou're running a marathon,\\ndoesn't matter if you're\\ndoing a yoga class,\\ndoesn't matter if you're\\ngoing for a 700 pound squat,\\nthe range of temperatures\\nwithin which ATP can function\\nand muscles can contract is very narrow.\\nSomewhere around 39 or 40\\ndegrees Celsius, it drops off\\nand you will not be able to\\ngenerate more contractions.\\nNow that's pretty hot,\\nbut that temperature\\ncan be generated locally really fast.\\nNow, if you're too cold,\\nit's true it's hard to\\ngenerate muscle contractions.\\nI got into doing some cold water\\nswimming a little while ago\\nand we would joke that, you\\nknow, you come out of the water,\\nwe do no wetsuits,\\nI'm not recommending\\npeople do this necessarily\\nunless you're with certainly\\nwith somebody else who's skilled\\nat doing it, which I was.\\nAnd you come out\\nand you feel like you\\nhave claws for hands.\\nYou can, you know, you\\ncould never text on a phone\\nfor the first few minutes,\\nI mean, the water was very, very cold\\nand you can't even move your face\\nand so muscles will become rigid\\nbut heating up muscles causes\\nthem to fail to be able\\nto generate more contractions.\\nPut simply if you get too\\nhot, you stop exercising.\\nYou may not even realize it\\nbut your will to exercise further,\\nyour ability to push harder\\nis entirely dependent on\\nthe heat of the muscle\\nboth locally and your whole system.\\nSo let's talk about your whole system\\nbecause I just described heat\\ndumping and heat maintaining.\\nI told you that increasing heat\\nmakes it hard for muscles to contract.\\nIt will stop you from being\\nable to run further and faster,\\nit will stop you from being\\nable to lift more weights,\\nmore sets, more repetitions.\\nIf you can keep temperature\\nin range however,\\nin a proper range, you will\\nbe able to do more work,\\nyou will be able to create greater output,\\nyou'll be able to lift more\\nweight, more sets, more reps\\nand you'll be able to run further.\\nNow, there are data that I'm going to talk\\nabout in a little bit that\\nare absolutely striking\\nthat underscore that statement.\\nThere are data from my\\ncolleague Craig Heller's lab\\nin the department of biology at Stanford\\nand there are data that\\nare now being implemented.\\nThey were first implemented\\nin a grant funded by DARPA\\nbut now in professional sports teams.\\nMany, if not all the NFL teams\\nare now using this technology\\nas well as military uses it\\nand not just for sports\\nperformance, but also firefighters,\\nconstruction workers, other professions\\nwhere elevated heat becomes\\na barrier to performance\\nand you can leverage this to\\nreally improve your workouts.\\nAnd when I say really\\nimprove, it is striking.\\nI'm going to give away a\\nlittle hint of this now\\nand then I'm going to\\ntell you a little bit more\\nof the data later after\\nI tell you the protocols.\\nProper cooling of the body,\\nwhich has to be done\\nin a very specific way,\\nhas allowed recreational athletes,\\ncollege students and typical adults\\nas well as professional athletes\\nto go from doing their usual output.\\nIn this case what comes to mind best\\nwould be a particular\\nprofessional athletes\\nthat a member of the 49ers at the time\\nwas able to do 40 dips on\\nhis first set, 30, 20, 20,\\nbasically to 10 sets of dips\\nunassisted with anything else.\\nThat's an impressive\\nespecially since he's a really large guy,\\n40 dips is as a respectable,\\nthese are strict, full, full range dips.\\nAnd then by the 10th set,\\nthere's a steep drop-off.\\nUsing proper cooling of\\nparticular body compartments,\\nhe was able to triple that\\nwithin less than a week\\nand maintain that performance\\neven without the cooling approach.\\nSo it was actually a\\nconditioning effect, all right?\\nI'll get back to this in a little bit\\nbut there are other\\nfantastic leaps of effort\\nand leaps of performance\\nthat were demonstrated\\nincluding endurance running.\\nBefore I continue any, I\\njust want to underscore again\\nthat overheating is terrible.\\nThere's a famous example of this.\\nThis was about 10, 15 years ago\\nwhen a number of dietary supplements\\nthat included things like\\nepinephrin which is a stimulant,\\nit's a beta adrenergic stimulant,\\ndrugs like Clenbuterol,\\nwhich were then banned from the Olympics,\\nwhich are still out there\\nhave been in recreational use\\nwhich were beta adrenergic\\nagonist so these are drugs\\nthat sort of mimic epinephrin\\nadrenaline to some extent,\\nI know I'm oversimplifying this here.\\nThey improve flat loss because\\nof the effects on metabolism\\nbut they heat up the body.\\nAnd what happened was, this\\nhit the press very widely\\nis high school football players\\nand various professional\\nathletes were dropping dead\\nbecause they were overheating\\nduring practice or in competition.\\nSo much so that Clenbuterol was banned.\\nAlthough every once in a while,\\nsomebody gets in trouble for using this,\\nthere was an incidence of this recently\\nin professional boxing which\\nwas attributed to a bad meat\\nthat had contained the Clenbuterol.\\nI don't know what the source was,\\nI don't have any commentary about that,\\nbut it still is in use,\\nbut these drugs increased\\nbody temperature,\\nincreased fat loss, but\\ncarry is severe danger\\nand that's the danger of hyperthermia.\\nIn fact, I would argue and I\\nthink in talking to some folks\\nat in various professional\\nfighting organizations\\nit's very clear that a lot\\nof the deaths that one sees\\nin professional combat\\nsports may have to do\\nas much with dehydration and overheating\\nas it does with getting hit in\\nthe head, which is also bad,\\nbut that things can compound\\nthat can have a synergistic effect.\\nAnd just a note about\\nthat and hyperthermia\\nand it's dangerous as well.\\nMy first project ever in science\\nwas to evaluate the thermogenic\\neffects of MDMA or ecstasy.\\nThat was my senior thesis\\nin college actually.\\nAnd what we found was that indeed drugs\\nthat remove your understanding\\nof how warm you are\\ncause you to not take on\\nthe appropriate behaviors\\nto cool yourself, right?\\nSo your vasoconstriction\\nand you're sweating,\\nthose are autonomic,\\nthose are going to happen no matter what\\nunless you happen to take\\nsomething that blocks that effect.\\nHowever, there are a lot of things\\nthat we as humans do to prevent\\nourselves from overheating\\nand the main one is stop.\\nWhen we are running in the desert\\nor when we're running very\\nhard and suddenly we stop,\\noftentimes that's because\\nthe muscles are overheating,\\nit's a subconscious thing.\\nWe won't often think, oh,\\nI'm really much too warm,\\nit's just that we stop\\nand it's a self-preservation mechanisms.\\nSometimes it kicks into early,\\nsometimes it kicks into late.\\nKicks in too late, you can die.\\nThere's an instance in the 1984 Olympics\\nwhere there was the first year I believe\\nthat there was a women's marathon,\\nI think that's correct.\\nAnd one of the front runners\\nor top picks for winning\\nwas heading into the stadium\\nand all of a sudden, it\\nseemed as if she was lost,\\nshe was kind of wandering around\\nnot knowing where she should go\\nand in fact, she was in a position to win\\nor at least take second\\nplace, at least take silver,\\ngot totally disoriented and\\ndid miserably in the race\\nand she was hyperthermic,\\nshe was running against\\nthat reflex to stop.\\nSo dumping heat is key.\\nSo how do you dump heat in\\norder to perform longer safely?\\nWell, in order to understand\\nthat you have to understand\\nthat the body has three main compartments\\nfor regulating temperature, okay?\\nWe don't just have a\\ncenter and a periphery,\\nwe have three main compartments\\nand there's one compartment in particular\\nthat all of you or most all\\nof you, I have to assume have\\nand if you can understand how that works,\\nyou can do tremendous\\nthings for your performance\\nand for your recovery.\\nSo what I'm about to tell you\\nwill allow you to perform\\nbetter in all forms of exercise\\nand it is not commonly known,\\nunfortunately, I'm here\\nto try and change that.\\nYou have three compartments\\nfor increasing or dumping\\nheat in your body.\\nOne is your core, we\\nalready talked about that.\\nYour core organs, your heart,\\nyour lungs, your pancreas, your liver,\\nthis is the core of your body.\\nThe other is your periphery,\\nwhich are obviously your arms\\nand your legs and your\\nfeet and your hands.\\nBut then there's a third component\\nwhich has their three\\nlocations on your body\\nthat are far better at\\npassing heat out of the body\\nand bringing cool into the body\\nsuch that you can heat up\\nor cool your body everywhere very quickly.\\nThose three areas are your\\nface, the palms of your hands\\nand the bottoms of your feet.\\nNow, the skin on your hands\\nand on the bottoms of your feet\\nand to some extent on your\\nface are called glaborous skin.\\nThat's G-L-A-B-O-R-O-U-S glaborous skin.\\nAnd what's special about\\nthose areas of your body\\nand the glaborous skin\\nis that the arrangement\\nof vasculature, of blood\\nvessels, capillaries and arteries\\nthat serve those regions is very different\\nthan it is elsewhere in your body.\\nNow, this has ancient roots.\\nTypically, if you were\\nanother mammal, like a bear\\nor some sort of ape, you would\\nhave hair all over your body.\\nNow we all know some pretty hairy people.\\nI presume you've heard that\\nthere are these hairy people,\\nI know a few excessively hairy people\\nand Castilla is excessively hairy\\nbut he's not a person obviously\\nbut all mammals have hair\\non their bodies, too.\\nSome people have very light\\nhair or very fine hair.\\nWe don't have hair on these\\nglaborous skin regions.\\nNow, of course you can have\\nbeard or facial hair growth\\nbut there are still\\nregions like the cheeks\\nand other areas that maintain\\nthis special vasculature.\\nOkay, so technically the hands and feet\\nare real glaborous skin\\nand the face is not always\\nquite classified as glaborous\\nbut these three locations\\nface, palms of hands\\nnot tops and bottoms of feet\\nare very good at dumping heat\\nand bringing in cool.\\nAnd the reason is there's\\na rule in vascular biology\\nthat blood moves from\\narteries to capillaries\\nand then to veins, and then\\nback to the heart, okay?\\nSo arteries which are\\nthe big ones obviously,\\ncapillaries which are the little fine ones\\nwhere oxygen and carbon\\ndioxide are exchanged\\nand veins which then bring\\nblood back to the heart\\nand other tissues of course.\\nIn these three regions\\nof your hands, your face\\nand the bottoms of your feet,\\nwe have what are called AVAs.\\nAVAs are a very special\\npattern of vasculature.\\nAVAs are described in\\nthe medical textbooks.\\nYou can find them in Grey's anatomy\\nnot the television show\\nbut the actual Grey's anatomy textbook\\nwhich is a real thing that exists\\nand in all medical textbooks, okay?\\nSo let's talk about AVAs and what they are\\nand why they allow these\\nthree regions of the body\\nto heat or cool ourselves more readily.\\nSo what are AVAs?\\nAVAs are arterio-venous anastomosis.\\nSo if you want to look that up\\nyou can just look up\\nAVAs veins, capillaries,\\narteries if you like, but\\nI'll spell it for you.\\nA-R-T-E-R-I-O, arterio\\nvenous, V-E-N-O-U-S,\\narterio-venous anastomosis,\\nA-N-A-S-T-O-M-O-S-E-S.\\nArterio-venous anastomosis, okay?\\nYou want to know about\\nArterio-venous anastomosis, trust me\\nand you want to remember\\nthat they are in your hands,\\nthe bottoms of your feet and on your face,\\nand in particular on\\nthe palms of your hands,\\nnot the tops of your hands.\\nNow, before I said blood flows typically\\nfrom arteries to capillaries, to veins,\\nand then back to the heart.\\nBut AVAs are direct connections\\nbetween the small arteries\\nand the small veins.\\nThey bypass the\\ncapillaries to some extent.\\nThey are little short vessel segments,\\nthey have a big, large inner diameter\\nand they have this very\\nthick, muscular wall.\\nAnd they get input from what\\nare called adrenergic neurons.\\nThey get input from neurons\\nthat release norepinephrine\\nand epinephrine,\\nwhich allows them to contract or dilate.\\nNow there's some rules of physics\\nthat talk about how the radius of a pipe\\nand small changes in the radius of a pipe\\nleads to massive increases in\\nthe rate and amount of stuff\\nthat can flow through that pipe, okay?\\nThere's a rule of physics\\nthat says essentially\\nthat the radius is proportional\\nto the amount of stuff\\nthat can flow through\\nsomething to the fourth power.\\nWe're not going to make\\nthis a physics class,\\nbut if you want to look that up, you can,\\nyou can just look up how\\ndoes the radius of a tube\\nor pipe relate to how quickly\\nor how much stuff can flow through it?\\nWhat you need to know,\\neven if you don't want to know\\nany of the underlying physics\\nis that these AVAs allow more heat\\nto leave the body more quickly\\nand more cool to enter\\nthe body more quickly\\nthan other venous arterial capillary beds\\nthroughout the body.\\nIn other words, you can heat\\nup best at the face, the palms\\nand the bottoms of the feet,\\nand you can cool down best\\nat the face, the palms and\\nthe bottoms of the feet\\nthan you can anywhere else on your body.\\nAnd when I say heat up or cool down,\\nI mean actually heat or cool\\nthe core end your brain.\\nOkay, so this is vitally important.\\nI realize we're getting down\\ninto the mechanistic weeds\\nhere, but you need to know\\nthat these three\\ncompartments of your body,\\npalms, bottoms of feet and face\\nare your best leverage points\\nfor manipulating temperature\\nto vastly improve physical\\nperformance, okay?\\nI also want to point out\\nthat the work that I'm\\ngoing to tell you about\\nis not work from my laboratory.\\nIt's the work of, as I mentioned,\\nmy colleague Craig Heller's\\nlaboratory at Stanford\\nand we're going to have\\nCraig on as a guest\\nto talk more about these discoveries,\\nthey are his and his\\ncolleagues discoveries\\nand how you can leverage them.\\nThey're building out\\nsome amazing technology.\\nI had a conversation with Craig yesterday\\nas a prelude to this episode\\nand to the future conversation with him\\nso you're getting the\\nvery latest on this topic.\\nSo what Craig and his colleagues did\\nreally illustrates perfectly\\nwhat these body surfaces can do and why.\\nThey were studying overheating\\nin athletes and in military\\nand in construction workers\\nand trying to prevent it.\\nAnd they did a bunch of experiments,\\nI won't go into all of them now\\nbut what they essentially found\\nwas that cooling the palms,\\npalmer cooling allowed people, athletes,\\nand recreational athletes\\nto run much further,\\nto lift more weight and\\nto do more sets and reps\\nto a absolutely staggering degree.\\nLet's talk for a second, a\\nbit more about why we stop,\\nwhy we shut off effort when we get too hot\\nbecause in doing so,\\nyou'll really understand\\nhow and why the best protocols exist\\nfor being able to do more work,\\nto be able to exercise longer\\nand actually to feel good doing it.\\nYou actually can make\\na doubling of your dips\\nor believe it or not a\\ntripling or quadrupling or more\\nof your pull-ups fairly straightforward.\\nI mentioned before that\\nwhen muscle heats up,\\nenzymes start getting disrupted\\nand ATP and muscles can't work so well\\nand those muscles can't contract.\\nLet's get a little more\\nspecific about that.\\nThe enzyme that's involved here\\nis something called pyruvate kinase.\\nYou don't need to know\\nabout pyruvate kinase\\nbut what you do need to\\nknow is that it ends A-S-E\\nwhich means it's an\\nenzyme and pyruvate kinase\\nis essentially a rate limiting step.\\nIt's a critical step that you can't bypass\\nif you want muscles to contract\\nand it's very temperature sensitive.\\nTherefore, if you can\\nkeep temperature lower,\\nyou can do more work per unit time,\\nyou can do more pull-ups\\nand that actually was done by Craig\\nand his colleagues, excuse me.\\nThe pull-ups weren't\\nactually done by Craig,\\nI don't know how many\\npull-ups Craig can do,\\nI'll ask him next time,\\nboth cooled and uncooled,\\nhow many pullups he can do.\\nBut what they essentially did\\nis they brought someone\\ninto their laboratory\\nwho could do 10 pull ups on the first set\\nand they were able to get 10,\\nrest two or three minutes get another 10,\\nrest or three minutes and\\nif you've ever tried this,\\nwhat you find is that you start dropping\\nto eight, seven, six, et cetera.\\nNow, the person might not necessarily feel\\nlike they're overheating,\\nbut the muscle is heating up.\\nThen with their knowledge that these AVAs,\\nthat these that these portals\\nin the palms are a great way\\nto both heat the body, but also\\nto dump heat from the body,\\nthey used the device\\nand I'll talk about\\nwhat you can do at home\\nbut a device where they had people hold on\\nto what was essentially a cold tube.\\nNow this is crucial, the\\ntube can't be so cold\\nthat it causes vasoconstriction\\nbecause then the cold\\nwon't pass from the tube\\nto the hand and to the core.\\nBut if it's the right temperature,\\nit's neither too hot nor too cold,\\nthat cool from the cold\\ntube passes into the hand,\\nthese so-called palmer regions\\nand then cools the core\\nand in theory by lowering body temperature\\nwould allow the person or\\nthe athlete to do more work\\nand indeed that's what they saw.\\nThe actual data, the specific data showed\\nthat subjects could do,\\nat least the subjects they worked with,\\non their first day with no\\ncooling about a hundred pull-ups\\nacross the timeframe that they had, okay?\\nSo it might've taken\\nanywhere from 10 to 15\\nor maybe more sets depending\\non how skilled that person was\\nbut in a fixed amount of time.\\nThen they came back and did the cooling.\\nThey did it the very next day\\nwhich if you've ever trained a muscle,\\nthe very next day typically\\nyou wouldn't do as well in its training\\nif it took any damage\\nfrom the previous session\\nor you at least do as well,\\nbut you probably wouldn't\\ndo what they then observed,\\nwhich was, they started\\nafter every other set,\\nthe person would just hold the cold tube,\\ncool down the body after every other set,\\nrest everything else was kept the same\\nand they found that they\\nwent to 180 pull-ups,\\nwhich is incredible, it's a near doubling.\\nAnd by doing this repeatedly\\nover several sessions,\\nover several weeks, they quickly\\nwent in the cooling group\\nfrom a maximum of somewhere\\nbetween 180 and 200 as I recall,\\nI'm sort of estimating now,\\nto 600 pull-ups in the\\nequivalent amount of time\\nwhich is absolutely incredible.\\nThey then repeated this in\\na study on the bench press\\nand actually the bench press\\nstudy was pretty interesting\\nbecause they actually had a control group\\nthat was admittedly\\ntaking specific amounts\\nof anabolic steroids,\\nthe antibiotic steroid\\nwas testosterone cypionate\\nwhich is essentially testosterone,\\nand indeed the testosterone cypionate,\\nthe steroid group improved at\\na rate of about 1% per week.\\nThere were differences\\nand the cooling group\\nbasically left all other\\ngroups in the dust,\\nit was just remarkable.\\nSo cooling the core, I\\nwant to be very clear\\nthat it's not cooling the muscle,\\nwasn't about cooling the chest alone\\nor just cooling the palms,\\nit was about allowing cold\\nto pass through the palms\\nbecause of the unique vasculature\\nthat's there, these AVAs\\nallowed the subjects to do\\nfar more work per unit time.\\nAnd the important thing is that\\nif they were to come back\\nafter doing 600 pull-ups\\nor 500 pull-ups, you might say,\\nwell, wow that's going\\nto create a situation\\nwhere recovery is going to\\nbe absolutely impossible.\\nThey could come back, not use the cooling\\nand they still saw a\\nhighly significant increase\\nin the amount or the\\nnumber of pull-ups or dips\\nor bench press weight\\nthat they could do, okay?\\nSo what that meant is that\\nit was both an excellent performance\\nand an excellent training stimulus\\nthat they were able to recover from, okay?\\nI don't know if all of\\nyou are following this\\nbut these are the sorts of increases\\nin exercise output that\\nare absolutely staggering\\nand that's why professional\\nteams and the military\\nand others capitalized on them\\nvery quickly and use these.\\nOkay, now you may be asking\\nwhat about endurance, right?\\nNot everyone wants to be\\nable to bench press a lot\\nfor multiple reps and sets.\\nAnd I should just mention\\nfor the bench pressing,\\nit was, I believe they were\\nthey found people that\\ncould bench press two 25,\\nso that's two 45 pound plates\\non the 45 pound standard Olympic bar\\nfor repetitions of anywhere from six to 10\\nand then they had them do the same thing.\\nThey did a set, they'd\\nrest two or three minutes,\\nsometimes up to four minutes,\\nthen do another set,\\nrepeat, repeat, repeat,\\nand with cooling, they were able\\nto increase the amount of work,\\nthe number of reps with the same weight.\\nSometimes they did have to increase sets\\nto approximately double,\\nso it was pretty fantastic.\\nSo with endurance, similar\\nincreases have been shown\\nand the way that they do those tests\\nare a little bit different\\nand they also point to a\\nreally important mechanism\\nof why we stopped doing work at all\\nwhen we perceive that we are\\nputting in too much effort.\\nSo it gets right to the\\nheart of the relationship\\nbetween temperature in\\nmuscle and your willpower,\\nthose are directly related.\\nYour body heat and your willpower\\nare linked in a physiological way.\\nSo I'm not talking about the kind of stuff\\nthat you see as kind of like\\nclickbait on the internet,\\nor like increase willpower\\nnow or become resilient now,\\nor never do this again if you\\nwant to be mentally strong,\\nI'm talking about a\\nphysiological mechanism\\nthat exists in the body and\\nbrain that causes you to stop\\nor that will allow you to\\ncontinue to go harder and further\\nthan you normally would.\\nOkay, so let's talk\\nabout willpower and heat\\nand how heat shuts you down.\\nIn other words, if you are cool,\\nif your body temperature\\nis in a particular range,\\nnot only can you go further,\\nbut you will go further if you want to.\\nSaid differently, if you heat up too much,\\nyou will stop or you will die.\\nTypically people stop, there\\nare individuals who will push\\nto the point where they black out and die,\\nin the same way that, and\\nplease don't do this experiment,\\nthere are people who can\\nsit down face to face\\nand say, let's hold our breath\\nand whoever breathes first loses.\\nSome people will just\\ngo until it's painful\\nand then they'll gasp\\nand take a big breath.\\nThere are always those individuals\\nwho can override that reflex\\nand they will go until\\nthey pass out, okay?\\nAnd if you do that in water,\\nyou can very easily die,\\nso please don't do that experiment.\\nBut there's a reflex that\\nrelates the body to the brain\\nand the brain to the body\\nthat shuts off our effort\\nwhen we get too hot.\\nSo what Craig and his colleagues\\nand now others have done\\nis to do a test in the laboratory\\nwhere rather than ask\\npeople to run outside\\nuntil they absolutely\\ndon't want to run anymore,\\nyou put them on a treadmill\\nand you set the speed, okay?\\nSo they have to keep up with the treadmill\\nand at some point they quit.\\nAnd you take groups and you do those\\nin different temperature environments.\\nSo some people are running\\nin a nice chilly laboratory,\\nthey get their heart rate up.\\nSo maybe their heart rate goes from,\\nyou know, 40 or 50 baseline heart rate,\\nmaybe it gets up to 80 or a hundred\\nand then they keep the rate of\\nthe treadmill going the same\\nand they'll just plateau.\\nSo they're getting into a\\nsteady state cadence or rhythm\\nand their heart is beating it\\nmore or less a steady state.\\nEventually they'll probably stop\\n'cause they have something else to do\\nbut people will continue\\nat that temperature\\nand at that heart rate,\\nunless you start turning up\\nthe temperature in the room\\nand at some point they will stop\\nand they'll stop much\\nearlier when it gets hot\\nbecause of something\\ncalled cardiac drift, okay?\\nSo let's say I'm running\\nand I'm running at a steady\\ncadence on this treadmill\\nand my heart rate is 85 beats per minute\\nor a hundred beats per\\nminute, doesn't matter,\\nlet's say a hundred just\\nfor sake of example.\\nWell, just making the room hotter\\nis going to increase\\nmy heart rate further,\\neven though I'm at the same output\\nand the brain does a computation,\\nit somehow figures out that\\nthere's a heat component\\nthat's increasing heart rate\\nand there's an effort\\ncomponent from running\\nthat's driving heart rate.\\nAnd if the heat component\\nand the heart rate output\\nfrom the effort, get to hit\\na certain threshold, I stop.\\nOkay, ad some of you may think,\\nwell there are people who just run\\nand run and run and never stop,\\neventually everyone stops.\\nMaybe it's because of the race ended,\\nmaybe it's because, you\\nknow, everyone else quit.\\nI actually saw some stuff online,\\nthere are these races where people\\njust will continuously do the same loop\\nuntil everyone else drops out\\nand then one guy or girl\\nkeeps going past everybody.\\nBut typically it stops\\nbecause the race is over\\nor because people quit.\\nIncreasing temperature\\nincreases the rate of quitting\\nin part, not entirely, but in part\\nbecause of this thing called cardiac drift\\nwhich you've probably experienced\\nif you've been out on a hot\\nday and you're walking uphill\\nyou might stop to take a breath.\\nIf you sit in a sauna, your\\nheart rate will increase.\\nHeat increases heart rate,\\neffort increases heart rate.\\nAt a steady effort, you'll\\nhave a steady heart rate.\\nIf you increase the\\nheat in the environment\\nthat you're engaging in\\nthat steady heart rate,\\nyour heart rate will now\\ngo up due to cardiac drift\\nand you will quit, okay?\\nSo Heller and colleagues\\nhave done experiments\\nwhere they do palmer cooling\\nunder these environments.\\nAnd that's wonderful because\\nnot only does it enable people\\nto go further and faster for much longer\\nthat's been shown statistically\\nsignificant every time\\nbut it also protects the brain and body\\nagainst hyperthermia,\\noverheating, coma, nerve injury,\\nnerve death, and actual death, okay?\\nSo you can see why this\\nis such a valuable tool.\\nSo what are they doing?\\nWell, in this case too they're\\nhaving them cool their hands\\nand they're cooling the palms.\\nCooling the bottoms of the\\nfeet is a little trickier\\nbut cooling the face could\\nactually work as well.\\nAnd we're going to talk\\nabout cooling the face\\nand how to incorporate this.\\nSo at this point, I've just really wanted\\nto impress upon you not impress\\nyou, but impress upon you\\nthe fact that you have these\\nthree surfaces of your body\\nthat are very good at\\npassing cold into the body,\\nsuch that it cools the\\ncore body temperature\\nand that's a good thing\\nfor health and safety\\nand in order to maintain work output\\nover longer periods of time,\\nor actually just do more work.\\nI mean to me the result\\nis just so staggering\\nis the hundred to 180\\npull-ups in the controls\\nand then 600 pull-ups in the\\ncooled individuals, right?\\nThey actually also feel mentally\\nas if they can do more work.\\nIt's not just that they can,\\ntheir willpower is adjusted somehow\\nby these shifts in temperature.\\nNow, before we continue\\nand get to the exact ways\\nthat any number of us can\\nstart to use this information,\\nI want to talk about the\\nopposite thing, which is heating.\\nAnd you have to remember\\nthat these surfaces,\\nthe palms and the bottoms\\nof the feet and the face\\nwill not just a range with these AVAs,\\nthese special ways to pass\\nblood from arteries to veins\\nin order to cool us for\\nbetter athletic performance\\nor to heat us for on cold days\\nbut for both of those things.\\nNow Heller and colleagues\\nand others have also explored\\nhow these can be used to heat up the core.\\nThere are times when we\\nwant to heat up our core.\\nTypically we hear that most of the heat\\nescapes through our heads,\\nso we'll put on a hat when we go outside,\\nthat's actually not true.\\nMost of your heat escapes\\nthrough your face,\\nthe palms of your hands and\\nthe bottoms of your feet.\\nNow you should know why that's the case.\\nWhat this means is that\\nfor post-surgery patients\\nor for people that are hypothermic,\\nindeed you want to heat the core, right?\\nBut actually I was on a swim recently\\nwhere a friend became hypothermic.\\nHe was kind of slurring his words\\nand kind of staggering around\\nwhen we got him back on the beach,\\nwe brought him over to\\nthe lifeguard station,\\nhe turned out to be fine.\\nAgain, this is why cold water swims\\nare something that you\\nreally need to do in groups,\\nnot alone and you really have\\nto know what you're doing.\\nThere were reasons for why\\nthis happened that day,\\nbut, you know we were basically\\npeople thought we were a little strange\\nuntil they realized what was happening.\\nWe were walking down the beach\\nbasically sandwiching him\\nbetween at our chest\\nbecause we were still warmer\\nthan the ambient environment,\\nthe environment around us.\\nAnd we were pushing our chest against him\\nto try and warm him up\\nto warm up his core.\\nIn retrospect, that was\\nthe wrong thing to do.\\nIn talking with Craig and\\ntalking to other colleagues\\nthat work on thermogenesis.\\nWhat we should have done was warm,\\nhit the palms of his hands,\\nthe bottoms of his feet\\nand his face because that\\nwould insulate the heat loss.\\nNow he was very cold\\nso presumably there was vasoconstriction\\nof the veins at these locations.\\nAnd so it's not clear\\nthat that would have been\\nthe only strategy to use\\nbut they have explored how to\\nheat up post-surgery patients\\nand one of the best ways to do that\\nis to get warm socks on\\nthe bottoms of the feet,\\nget gloves on the hands\\nand if it can be done\\nsafely to warm the face.\\nNow, of course you don't\\nwant to obstruct respiration\\nand things of that sort.\\nBut again the ability to\\npass heat into the body\\nor to remove heat to the body\\nis best done through these three surfaces.\\nI can't emphasize that enough.\\nSo I mentioned before that\\nyou want to cool the palms\\nor the bottoms of the feet\\nalthough that's a little\\nharder to do or the face\\nbut not so much that the\\nblood vessels constrict\\nbecause then you won't be able\\nto pass cool into the body\\nbecause those pipes got smaller\\nand therefore you can't\\npass cool into the body.\\nSo how can you start to incorporate this?\\nWell, Craig and colleagues have a company\\nthat they've spun out through Stanford.\\nWe'll talk about that when\\nwe sit down with Craig\\nthat has made engineered devices\\nthat are optimal for this\\nthat are going to keep\\nthose passages open,\\nkeep the size of the, those\\nveins correct to pass cool\\ninto the body quickly for sake\\nof elite sports performance\\nand even recreational sports performance\\nbut you can actually\\nstart to incorporate this.\\nFirst of all, I always get asked\\nhow cold should the water be?\\nShould it be ice water?\\nShould it be very cold water?\\nThe answer is no.\\nIf you want to experience\\nsome of this effect\\nwithout a device, one thing you could do\\nwould be for instance to do, I dunno,\\nI'll use the, the, the gym or\\nthe treadmill as an example.\\nYou could do your maximum\\nnumber of pull-ups, stop\\nand then you could actually\\nput your hands into\\nor on the surface of a sink\\nthat is presumably stopped up\\nwith cool water.\\nSo not ice water, not\\nfreezing cold, but cool water,\\nslightly cooler than body temperature\\nbefore you started training\\nwould be a good place to start.\\nYou do that for 10 to 30 seconds.\\nThen you could go back\\nand do your next set.\\nYou would repeat the cooling,\\nyou would want to extend the\\namount of cooling somewhat\\nso you might want to do that\\nfor 30 seconds to a minute.\\nThis is not going to be perfect,\\nyou're going to have to play\\nwith how cold to make it\\nin order to get the optimal effect\\nbut you ought to see\\nan effect nonetheless.\\nThe same is true if you're\\nrunning and you're fatiguing,\\nobviously you don't want\\nto become hyperthermic,\\ncooling the hands or the\\nbottoms of your feet or the face\\nwould be the ideal way to dump heat\\nin order to be able to\\ngenerate more output.\\nNow, the face is something\\nthat we haven't talked a lot about.\\nEverything I've told you\\nup until now also says\\nthat if you are somebody\\nwho tends to get cold\\nwhen you are outside, say in\\nthe winter or even in the fall,\\nyou tend to run cold, warming your face\\nis going to be the most important thing\\nthat you can do.\\nNow, it's kind of hard to do\\nthat without looking strange\\nlike wearing a ski mask\\nor something like that\\nbut that is going to be more effective\\nthan covering and warming\\nany other part of your body\\nalthough it'd be quite strange\\nif you only had a ski mask on\\nand you weren't wearing clothes\\nanywhere else on your body,\\nI don't recommend doing that outside,\\nthat will get you into all\\nsorts of other kinds of trouble.\\nThat wouldn't be good for anybody.\\nBut now you understand the\\nprinciple and the locations\\nat which to deliver heat and cold.\\nSo let's say that you are out for a run\\nand you want to incorporate\\nthis cooling mechanism,\\nI talked to Craig about this,\\nI said, what would be the\\nkind of poor person's approach\\nto this before this devices\\ncommercially available?\\nAnd he said, well, you, you\\ncould take a frozen juice can,\\nif you have one of those\\nor a very cold can of soda\\nand you would want to\\npass it back and forth\\nbetween your two hands.\\nThe reason the passing back\\nand forth is really important\\nis because you, again you\\ndon't want it to be so cold\\nthat you constrict those veins portals\\nthat it will allow cold\\nto go into the body.\\nNow, there are certainly people\\nthat are working on bike handles,\\nand that can actually cool the hands.\\nYou can expect with\\nthe Olympics coming up,\\npeople are aware of these data\\nand are starting to incorporate\\nit into a number of things.\\nHere's what you don't want to\\ndo and there are sports teams\\nthat I won't mention by name or brand\\nthat have made this mistake\\nand it costs them dearly.\\nYou don't want to cool the core\\nif you want to cool the body, right?\\nIf it's very hot day and\\nyou're going to train,\\ngetting into an ice bath first,\\nsure it will cool you down,\\nbut it's not going to be as\\neffective as cooling the palms,\\nthe bottoms of the feet and the face.\\nI have a friend who does some\\nimportant work in this space\\nwith people in various,\\nlet's just say cultures\\nwhere heat is generated quite a lot\\nand they need to dump heat,\\nice packs delivered to the face\\nare something that they actually use\\nin order to dump heat quickly.\\nNow, again, you don't want\\nto keep the ice pack on your face.\\nThese are people that are\\nvery high work output, right?\\nFirefighters and similar,\\nat very high work output\\nand then they'll put this essentially,\\nit's like a cool face mask on their face.\\nIt allow their core body\\ntemperature come down\\nand then they remove it,\\nthey're not keeping it on there so long\\nthat they're getting the\\nvasoconstriction, okay?\\nSo there are a number of\\nways that you could do this.\\nAnd again, I'm not giving\\nspecific temperatures\\nbecause it depends on how hot that day\\nand how hot your body temperature is.\\nSo you can see why there's a\\nneed to create more devices\\nfor this, but you can see\\na considerable improvement\\nin endurance, in strength\\nand in all kinds of explosive\\nand sort of, you know,\\nexplosive power type output\\nin athletics by using\\nthese surfaces of the hands\\nand bottoms of the feet and face.\\nThe one that I've tried\\nbecause in anticipation of\\nthis episode was the dips\\nwhere then I would cool my hands,\\nI actually decided to cool the\\nbottoms of my feet as well,\\nbecause it just feels good\\nand it's particularly hot out lately,\\nso no shoes or socks on,\\nput my feet into the bottoms of my feet\\njust kind of hovering\\nabout a centimeter or two\\nbelow the surface of a bucket of water\\nthat was just slightly, it felt cool,\\nslightly cooler than\\nbody temperature or so.\\nIt just basically what\\ncame out of the spigot\\nafter I let it run for a little bit.\\nAnd indeed I saw a 60% increase\\nin the number of dips I\\ncan do in a single session.\\nSo it's actually a\\nquite significant effect\\nand you don't have to be perfectly precise\\nin order to do it.\\nAnd of course, if you want to\\nheat up for whatever reason,\\nlike you're camping or you're\\nlost in the environment,\\nremember these three surfaces\\nare going to be the best\\nway to heat your as well.\\nSo up until now, we've been\\ntalking about how to use cold\\nduring a workout in order\\nto improve performance\\nand indeed cold applied\\nto the appropriate parts of\\nthe body, the appropriate times\\ncan vastly improve our performance\\nand endurance and strength.\\nNow, I want to talk about\\nthe use of temperature\\nin particular cold to improve the speed\\nand the depth of recovery.\\nRecovery is obviously vital, right?\\nDuring a weight training session\\nor during an endurance session,\\nthat's just the stimulus for\\ngetting better the next time\\nand if you don't recover, you\\nnot only won't get better,\\nbut you'll get worse.\\nThere's a lot of interest\\nin the use of cold\\nin order to improve\\nrecovery in the short term.\\nWe see this and probably\\nthe best example of this\\nwould be fighters in combat sports\\nbetween rounds or athletes during\\nin between quarters or halftime,\\nthat's one form of recovery.\\nThe ability to go back\\ninto the sport very soon\\non an order of minutes,\\nanywhere from like one minute\\nin between rounds and\\ntypical combat sports\\nor several minutes and\\na half time, et cetera.\\nTypically what we see is\\npeople cooling their core,\\ncooling the back of their neck,\\ncooling the top of their heads.\\nSo it might be, you know,\\na sponge with cold water\\nover the top of the head\\nor an ice pack on the back of the neck,\\nor in some cases even\\nwearing cold ice vests,\\nthat's actually been done.\\nThat's going to be a very inefficient way\\nto improve recovery of that kind.\\nFar better would be to cool the face,\\nthe palms of the hands\\nor the bottoms the feet\\nfor the reasons that I\\ndescribed up until now.\\nSubmerging the body in an ice\\nbath, or taking a cold shower,\\nsay up to the neck or up to the chest\\nor getting under cold water\\nor jumping in a cold lake\\nor something of that sort,\\nor in the locker room,\\ngetting under the cold shower\\nalso would be a terrible way\\nto cool off the body quickly\\ncompared to the ways that I described\\nthrough the palms of the\\nhands, the bottoms of the feet\\nor the face for the following reason.\\nFirst of all, it's not optimizing\\nthose portals of the face,\\npalms the hands and the feet\\nand in addition, if it's\\nvery cold and you submerge\\nor you cover a lot of\\nthe body with that cold,\\nyou're going to cause constriction\\nof the very vessels and pathways\\nthat allow the body to\\nefficiently dump heat.\\nSo again, the key thing\\nis to cool these one\\nor two or three of these surfaces\\nbut not so cold that you\\ncause the vasoconstriction.\\nSo what does this mean for you?\\nIt means that getting in an\\nice bath or a cold shower\\nor putting an ice pack\\non the back of your neck\\nin most cases is not going to be as good\\nas splashing cold water on your face\\nor even just holding your\\nface in a damp cool cloth\\nor something of that sort.\\nIt seems kind of counterintuitive,\\nyou think, oh if I just\\njump into an ice bath,\\nI'm going to cool down much faster\\nthan if I just cooled these,\\nyou know one or two or three\\nof these select regions of the body\\nbut that's actually not the case.\\nAnd then of course\\nthere's recovery that occurs\\nfrom session to session.\\nSo outside of the game or the\\nmatch or the exercise session\\nand many people are now relying\\non things like cryotherapy\\nwhich requires a lot\\nof expensive equipment,\\nbig, you know liquid\\nnitrogen driven machine.\\nThose aren't so common for most people\\nor accessible for most\\npeople, but a lot of people\\nare using cold baths or\\nice baths or cold showers.\\nAnd again, that's not\\ngoing to optimize recovery.\\nIn fact, it's going to\\nhave an additional effect\\nthat is going to potentially\\nblock the training stimulus.\\nWhen you get into an ice\\nbath indeed, there are,\\nprovided it's not very, very cold,\\nif you get into a cold shower,\\nprovided is not very, very cold,\\nyou are indeed blocking\\nsome of the inflammation\\nthat occurs because of\\nthe training session.\\nBut in doing so you also\\nare blocking pathways,\\nsuch as mTOR, mammalian\\ntarget of rapamycin,\\nwhich are involved in the adaptation\\nfor a muscle to become stronger or bigger.\\nPut simply, covering the body in cold\\nor immersing the body\\nin cold after training\\ncan short circuit or\\nprevent the hypertrophy\\nor muscle growth response.\\nIt has other effects that\\ncan be positive, right?\\nIt can induce thermogenesis, et cetera,\\nit can reduce inflammation\\nbut it can prevent some of the\\npositive effects of exercise.\\nNow, it hasn't been examined\\nso much for endurance work\\nbut let's say you come back\\nfrom around of endurance work\\nor run or a bike or a swim,\\ngetting into a cool bath\\nor cooling the palms, the\\nbottoms of the feet or the face,\\nin my opinion, based on\\nthe science would be better\\nthan completely immersing\\nthe body in the ice bath\\nor the cold shower.\\nThere is a time and a place\\nfor the use of the ice\\nbath or the cold shower\\nor the cold plunge, those tend to be\\nwhen you want to deliberately\\nincrease brown fat thermogenesis\\nor when you want to deliberately\\nwork on mental resilience.\\nAnd in a subsequent episode on fat loss\\nI'm going to talk about how\\nto optimize the use of cold\\nspecifically for increasing\\nmetabolism and fat loss.\\nBut for now, since we're\\ntalking about the use of cold\\nfor improving performance and recovery,\\nthe suggestion that I'm going\\nto provide is based on the work\\nof Craig Heller and colleagues\\nthat I've been talking about\\nas well as a excellent book\\nI mainly rely on textbooks\\nand special volume books which\\nare collections of papers\\nfrom experts in a particular area\\nthat go beyond standard kind\\nof college level textbooks.\\nThe one that I've been relying on\\nis called \\\"Thermoregulation\\nin Human Performance,\\nPhysiological and Biological\\nAspects\\\" by Effie Marino.\\nI don't know the publisher,\\nI don't know the author.\\nI do recognize some of the names\\nof the particular papers there,\\nbut I just want to be clear\\nthere's no sort of business\\nrelationship or deal with them\\nbut it's an excellent text,\\nit's called \\\"Thermoregulation\\nin Human Performance\\\".\\nYou can find it online\\nif you want to go really deep into this\\nbut basically what they show is that\\nif you can cool the body back\\nto its resting temperature,\\nfor and by resting temperature, I mean\\nwithin the range that you would see\\nat any time of waking\\nday, but not in exercise.\\nSo just bringing that the body\\ntemperature down to baseline.\\nIf you can do that,\\nthe sooner you can do\\nthat after a workout,\\nthe sooner that the muscle will recover,\\nthat the tendons will recover\\nand that the person you\\ncan get back into more endurance training,\\nmore weight training, et cetera.\\nSo cold actually can be a very\\npowerful tool for recovery\\nbut to maximize return to\\nbaseline levels of temperature,\\nit's my belief based on the studies\\nthat are published in this book\\nas well as my discussions with\\nmy colleague, Craig Heller\\nand in reviewing the literature overall\\nthat just simply cooling the entire body\\nby jumping into an ice\\nbath or a cold shower\\nis not the best way to go.\\nYou really want to rely\\non one of these three\\nglaborous skin portals of the palms,\\nthe bottoms of the feet or the face.\\nSo now you probably know more\\nthan you ever wanted to know\\nabout how we regulate body temperature\\nand how it can be applied to exercise\\nboth during the exercise session\\nand afterward to optimize recovery.\\nMany of us, all of us, presumably\\nare also eating and drinking\\nthings and taking things\\nat various times that\\ncan impact this process.\\nAnd so, because of that, we should ask\\nwhether or not those things\\nare impacting body temperature.\\nAnd when we do that, we find\\nthat there are certain things\\nthat many of us are doing\\nthat are actually\\nimpairing our performance.\\nSo for instance, if you are\\ntaking a pre-workout drink\\nor you're ingesting a lot of\\ncaffeine or other substance\\nto bring your body temperature\\nup before exercise,\\nyou are limiting the amount\\nof exercise that you can do.\\nI can recall a time in college\\nwhen I would drink a lot of espresso\\nback then ephedrine was\\nsold over the counter,\\nI remember taking it,\\nit will really energize you for workouts.\\nYou can generate a lot of energy\\nand get extremely focused\\ntaking those things.\\nThey do increase heart rate,\\nthey can be quite dangerous,\\nI don't recommend people take them.\\nIn fact, I think ephedrine\\nis now off the shelves\\nas a non prescription compound\\nbecause various people died from taking it\\nwho were sensitive to\\nit or exercised in heat.\\nBut looking back at that,\\nI realized it was a foolish approach.\\nIt was increasing core thermogenesis.\\nSure I might've burned a few more calories\\nbut actually when I look at the data\\nthat are coming from specific cooling\\nand how that can so\\nincrease in performance\\nif done properly and then I\\ncompare that to the effects\\nof taking some sort of thermogenic\\ncompound, whatever it is\\nsome pre-workout or some pill\\nor high levels of caffeine,\\nit's very clear that\\nincreasing body temperature\\nprior to working out is\\nthe exact wrong thing\\nthat one would want to do.\\nYou don't want to stay so cold\\nthat you can't generate\\ngood muscle contractions.\\nYou don't want to be like I am\\ncoming out of the cold ocean,\\nyou know, with claws for hands\\nbut one wants to have your\\nbody temperature in a range\\nthat still allows you to\\nwork hard and perform well.\\nNow, in terms of recovery,\\nthings like alcohol,\\nwe know our vasodilator.\\nSo those are going to cause\\npeople to drop body temperature.\\nSo you might think, oh, well\\nthat sounds great for recovery\\nand I don't think people\\nshould be drinking who are\\nyou know, have problems\\nwith alcohol intake,\\nyou know, alcoholics\\nor they're not of drinking age, et cetera.\\nI'm not a drinker, but\\nI do have a good friend\\nwho's a quite accomplished athlete\\nwho basically drinks a beer or two\\nafter his long runs or cycling\\nand you know, his argument\\nis well, I'm dumping body\\nheat and I like a beer\\nand he's probably right, it's\\nprobably a really good tool\\nprovided you don't have\\nissues with alcohol\\nthat would preclude that as a tool\\nor you're not of drinking age.\\nBut anything that you\\ningest after exercise\\nthat would increase body temperature\\nis going to impede recovery.\\nAnything that you do that\\nlowers body temperature\\nprovides it's in safe ranges\\nis going to accelerate recovery.\\nAnd that brings us to the\\nwhole host of compounds\\nthat people take that can\\nincrease body temperature.\\nAnd many people are taking these things\\nin order to increase fat\\nburning and increase metabolism\\nbut in my opinion\\nit's impeding their\\nability to perform well.\\nAnd especially if the performance\\nis something that you're focused on\\naside from body recomposition,\\nlosing fat building muscle.\\nBut even if you're focused on\\nlosing fat, building muscle\\nyou have to ask yourself, is\\nthe body temperature increase\\nthat I'm getting from these\\ncompounds really worth it\\ngiven that it can block\\nor prevent my performance\\nfrom being as good as it could?\\nIn other words, is it\\nworth taking something\\nthat makes you feel very\\nenergized to go work out\\nbut then you now know that\\nyou are stopping earlier\\nand you're performing\\nless well, fewer reps,\\nfewer steps overall, is it worth it?\\nIf you had not taken that thing\\nthen you could perform much longer\\nand at much higher capacity.\\nSome of you are probably\\nsaying, well, that's ridiculous\\nbecause when I drink a quadruple espresso\\nand I pop a whatever pre-workout\\nor drink a pre-workout\\nthen I know I can go much further.\\nAh, that might be true but\\nthe increase in temperature\\nis also costing you on the recovery side.\\nAnd unless you're doing other things\\nto improve your recovery and\\nI know many people that are,\\nI don't judge but many people\\nwho are doing those things\\nare also augmenting their recovery\\nthrough hormone augmentation\\nand other performance enhancing tools,\\nthen for the typical\\nperson who's not doing that\\nit's probably shooting\\nyourself in the foot.\\nSo let's take a look at what\\nsome of those compounds are\\nand what they and just briefly review\\nwhether or not they would be a\\ngood or a bad idea to include\\nif your main goals are performance\\nor your main goals are\\nbody recomposition or both.\\nSo let's just briefly discuss stimulants.\\nThis could be caffeine,\\nthis could be any other kind of stimulant\\nthat are typically in a pre-workout drink\\nor anything that might get you\\nrevved up before exercising.\\nThis could even be very strong tea,\\nI've mentioned I'm a big consumer of mate.\\nI like a yerba mate, I love that stuff\\nand I also drink caffeine.\\nI drink love coffee of various kinds\\nmushroom coffee, black\\ncoffee, espresso, et cetera.\\nI'm a chronic caffeine user,\\nI don't think I'm an addict\\nbut I'm a chronic caffeine user.\\nMeaning when I drink caffeine\\nmy heart rate doesn't increase so much\\nthat it feels like a shock to my system.\\nSome people are not caffeine adapted\\nor they're very caffeine sensitive.\\nHere's the straightforward rule.\\nCaffeine for somebody who\\ndoesn't drink caffeine very much\\nwill constrict the blood vessels\\nand will increase retention of body heat\\nand it's probably a bad\\nidea before exercise.\\nFor somebody who's caffeine adapted\\nand is used to drinking caffeine,\\nit won't have that\\nvasoconstriction effect,\\nthat's what the data point\\ntoo, because I'm adapted to it\\nbut it will cause vasodilation\\nand will allow me to dump body heat.\\nSo for me, I use it before I train\\nor do any kind of exercise\\nbecause I tend to do\\nthat early in the day,\\nit won't prevent me from sleeping\\nand it causes vasodilation.\\nAnd then afterwards I'm aware\\nthat it causes vasoconstriction\\nafter the caffeine wears off.\\nSo for somebody who drinks two or three\\nor more cups of coffee\\na day or mate a day,\\nso we're talking intake\\nof anywhere from a hundred to\\n400 milligrams of caffeine,\\nwhat you want to do is\\nyou want to make sure\\nthat you would do that before exercise\\nand probably not after exercise,\\nnot just makes logical sense\\ngiven what we know about\\nthermal regulation.\\nAnd if you're somebody who\\ndoesn't drink caffeine,\\ndrinking caffeine before a workout\\nis going to be about the worst thing\\nthat you could possibly do\\nbecause it's going to\\nincrease core body temperature\\nthrough its thermogenic effects\\nand it's going to constrict\\nyour blood vessels\\nand make it even harder to dump heat.\\nSo I don't suggest that\\npeople drink caffeine or not,\\nI just suggest that you think about\\nwhether or not your\\ncaffeine adapted or not,\\nand decide whether or not\\nyou want to drink caffeine.\\nIn general, you're going to be\\nbetter not drinking any caffeine\\nthan you are drinking caffeine\\nunless you're a heavy\\ncaffeine user or abuser.\\nIn which case not drinking caffeine\\nis going to give you vicious headaches\\nand is going to make it\\nvery hard to get motivated\\nbecause you're just not used to it.\\nIt takes about three weeks\\nto get used to no caffeine.\\nIt's brutal, I've done it\\nbefore, I've done caffeine fast,\\nI don't know that I ever\\nwant to do it again,\\nthat's how painful it was.\\nBut you get headaches\\nbecause of the effects on\\nvasodilation and constriction.\\nIf you like caffeine\\nuse in moderate amounts\\nand use it before your not after.\\nIf you don't like caffeine or\\nyou don't use it very often,\\nstay away from it\\nanywhere close to exercise\\nbefore or after for that matter.\\nOne of the more commonly used compounds\\nthat's sold over the counter\\nare non-steroid anti-inflammatories\\nso things like Tylenol and\\nAdvil and other trade names\\nand Neproxin sodium things of that sort,\\nalmost all of those drop body\\ntemperature to some extent.\\nAnd that's why it's often recommended\\nthat people take them\\nwhen they have a fever\\nalthough the whole business\\nof dropping body temperature artificially\\nwhen you have a fever is itself\\nan interesting discussion\\nwhether or not that's the most\\nadaptive or best thing to do\\ncertainly you don't want\\nfever to go too high,\\ncan be very dangerous, can kill you\\nbut artificially dropping body temperature\\nwith these compounds can be tricky.\\nNow, a number of athletes\\nespecially endurance athletes\\nwill rely on these non-steroid\\nanti-inflammatory drugs\\nspecifically to keep\\nbody temperature lower\\nduring long bouts of exertion.\\nThis is a little bit of\\na pharmacologic version\\nof dumping heat instead\\nof using palmer cooling\\nor you know, face ice pack cooling,\\nthey're relying on pharmacology\\nto drop their core body temperature.\\nThat has certain obvious advantages,\\nthose advantages should be obvious\\nand the reasons for them should be obvious\\nbased on everything we've\\ntalked about up until now\\nlower temperature allows\\nyou to go further harder\\nwith more intensity.\\nHowever, they do have effects on the liver\\nand they can also have\\neffects on the kidneys\\nand during long bouts of exercise\\nor even short bouts of exercise,\\nwater balance and salt balance\\nare also going to be vital\\nto maintain in order to perform well,\\ngenerate the best muscle\\ncontraction, stay mentally alert\\nand also to stay alive.\\nWe will do an episode on\\nsalt electrolytes and water\\nand water balance but you\\nprobably want to think carefully\\nabout whether or not\\nyou want to use non-steroid\\nanti-inflammatories\\nbefore any training session\\njust for the performance\\naugmentation effect\\nunless you're working\\ncarefully with a coach\\nwhether or not you've\\ndone that in practices\\nand of course, whether or\\nnot you are in a situation\\nwhere monitoring your\\nbody temperature carefully\\nis going to be important.\\nYou might ask, well, when would that be?\\nWell, desert races, summer\\ntraining and races, winter rides,\\nyou certainly don't want\\nto get too cool either.\\nSo alcohol, caffeine and\\nnon-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs\\nbecause of their effects on temperature\\nwill impact performance and recovery\\nbut you want to be cautious\\nabout how you approach them.\\nI personally am more a\\nfan of using caffeine\\nin moderate doses for the\\nreasons I described before\\nas well to use the cooling of the palms,\\ncooling of the bottoms of my feet, right,\\nby placing them into a\\nbucket or into a cool bath\\nafter training or cooling\\nthe face after training\\nor sometimes even during training.\\nIt just seems like\\nthere's more of a margin\\nto play with the variables,\\nto heat up the water\\nor cool it down a little\\nbit to include one palm\\nor the other palm.\\nThere's all sorts of good parameter space\\nas we call it in science\\nthat you can play with\\nand work with to find what works for you\\nwhereas when you pop a pill,\\nsure you can adjust the dose\\nand you can adjust it next time\\nbut once it's in you, it's in you\\nand there's going to\\nbe some period of time\\nbefore you can modulate it.\\nWhat I've offered today\\nare ways in which you can use temperature\\nto powerfully improve performance.\\nAnd if you think about it,\\nyou can vary that from set to set,\\nyou could do your pull ups or your sprints\\nand then cool your palms,\\nand then try and go with\\ncolder water the next round\\nor warmer water the next round\\nor do both feet and palms and face.\\nI mean, you can do all sorts\\nof things moment to moment\\nand see what works for you again\\nessentially zero cost or no cost.\\nWhereas when you pop\\nsomething, you take a pill,\\nyou're basically in that regimen\\nfor the next hour or two or more.\\nYou can always take more, but\\nyou can't really take less.\\nYou can't really extract it\\nfrom your body in real time\\nso it doesn't give you\\na lot of opportunity\\nto play scientists, which\\nis what I like to do\\nbecause what I'm always trying to do\\nis trying to dial in the\\nbest protocols possible\\nbased on the mechanisms and data.\\nAnd if you can do that moment to moment\\nthat places you in a position of power.\\nOnce again, we covered a lot of material.\\nBy now, after seeing this episode\\nor listening to this episode,\\nyou should understand a lot\\nabout how your body heats and cools itself\\nand the value of that\\nfor physical performance.\\nI hope you'll also appreciate\\nthat you have tools at your disposal\\nto vastly improve your\\nphysical performance.\\nAnd should you try those,\\nplease let us know how it goes.\\nIf you decide to do palmer\\ncooling during your runs\\nor after your runs, during\\nyour weight workouts,\\nduring your yoga sessions,\\nwhatever it is, let us know,\\nplease place that in the comments.\\nI've given you specific\\nprotocols and some direction,\\nbut I've also left it slightly vague\\nbecause it, as I mentioned earlier\\nI don't know all the\\nenvironmental conditions,\\nI don't know how hot your yoga studio is\\nor how cool your gym happens to be\\nor your body temperature or time of day.\\nRemember your temperature will vary\\naccording to the time of day,\\nwe did a whole episode\\nabout that related to sleep.\\nTypically your body temperature\\nis rising early in the day\\nand is coming down as you\\napproach the late evening\\nand late night hours for sleep,\\nin the middle of the night\\nyour temperature is very low\\nat its absolute lowest\\nsomething we call the temperature minimum.\\nSo we don't know exactly where you're at.\\nYou need to take the information\\nthat you receive today\\nand should you try and incorporate it\\ntry and do it intelligently.\\nDon't cool yourself off\\nso much that you know\\nbecome cryogenic and please\\ndon't warm yourself up.\\nIn fact, we didn't talk at\\nall about warming yourself up\\nbecause warming yourself up too\\nmuch can be quite dangerous.\\nYou never, ever, ever\\nwant to be hypothermic,\\nthat's what your body and your\\nbrain are trying to avoid.\\nWe talked a little bit about supplements\\nbut not the standard sorts of supplements\\nI usually list off on these episodes.\\nRather, we talked about caffeine,\\nnon-steroid anti-inflammatories\\nand how those can impact temperature,\\nhow alcohol can impact temperature.\\nAnd I should just mention in closing\\nthat every time we eat, we\\nalso increased temperature.\\nThere's a eating induced\\nthermogenic effect\\nbut that's a minor one,\\nthat's a small one.\\nSo you wouldn't worry about\\neating before training\\nbecause of its effects on temperature\\nbecause it tends to be really minor.\\nGoing forward, we're going to\\ntalk more about temperature\\nand other ways to improve\\nphysical performance\\nand skill learning.\\nWe're going to talk about specific ways\\nto accelerate fat loss,\\nto improve muscle growth,\\nto improve suppleness and flexibility.\\nThese approaches and\\nmechanisms are anchored deeply\\nin neuroscience and physiology\\nand the relationship\\nbetween our peripheral\\norgans, which include our skin\\nand our brain and all\\nthe organs in between.\\nSo it's really a pleasure for\\nme because I'm able to look\\nto the textbook literature that exists\\nand really came out over the\\nlast 50 to a hundred years\\nand unlike a lot of areas of neuroscience\\nwhich are still sort of mystical,\\nlike consciousness and dreaming,\\nof which we understand a little bit\\nabout these core mechanisms\\nof temperature and physiology\\nwhich are so powerful,\\ninvolve very concrete studies\\nthat as you learn today\\nare very actionable.\\nIf you're enjoying this podcast\\nand you like the information\\nthat you're receiving,\\nif you're

              "'- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\\nwhere we discuss science\\nand science based-tools for everyday life.\\n[light music]\\nI\\'m Andrew Huberman,\\nand I\\'m a Professor of\\nNeurobiology in Ophthalmology\\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\\nRecently, I had the pleasure\\nof hosting two live events,\\none in Seattle, Washington,\\nand one in Portland, Oregon,\\nboth entitled \"The Brain Body Contract,\"\\nwhere I discussed science\\nand science-related tools\\nfor mental health, physical\\nhealth and performance.\\nMy favorite part of each evening, however,\\nwas the question and answer period\\nthat followed the lecture.\\nI love the question and answer period\\nbecause it gives me an\\nopportunity to hear directly\\nfrom the audience as to\\nwhat they want to know most,\\nand indeed to get into a bit of dialogue.\\nSo we really clarify what\\nare the underlying mechanisms\\nof particular tools,\\nhow best to use the tools for\\nthings like focus and sleep.\\nWe also touched on some things\\nrelated to mental health\\nand physical health.\\nIt was a delight for me,\\nand I like to think that\\nthe audience learned a lot.\\nI know that many of you weren\\'t\\nable to attend those events,\\nbut we wanted to make the\\ninformation available to you.\\nTherefore, what follows\\nthis is a recording\\nof the question and answer period\\nfrom the lecture in Portland, Oregon.\\nI hope you\\'ll find it to be\\nboth interesting and informative.\\nI\\'d also like to thank our\\nsponsors of these live events.\\nThe first is Momentous Supplements,\\nwhich is our partner with\\nthe \"Huberman Lab Podcast,\"\\nproviding supplements that are\\nof the very highest quality\\nthat ship international and\\nthat are arranged in dosages\\nand single ingredient\\nformulations that make it possible\\nfor you to develop the optimal\\nsupplement strategy for you.\\nAnd I\\'d also like to\\nthank our other sponsor,\\nwhich is InsideTracker,\\nwhich provides blood tests and DNA tests\\nso you can monitor your immediate\\nand long-term health progress.\\nI\\'d also like to announce that there are\\ntwo new live events scheduled.\\nThe first one is going to take\\nplace Sunday, October 16th,\\nat The Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles.\\nThe other live event will take place\\nWednesday, November 9th,\\nat the Beacon Theatre in New York City.\\nTickets to both of those\\nevents are now available online\\nat hubermanlab.com/tour.\\nThat\\'s hubermanlab.com/tour.\\nI do hope that you learn\\nfrom and enjoy the recording\\nof the question and answer\\nperiod that follows this.\\nAnd last, but certainly not least,\\nthank you for your interest in science.\\n[light music]\\n\"What are the current best\\npractices for post TBIs,\"\\ntraumatic brain injuries for those of you\\nthat aren\\'t familiar with TBIs,\\n\"Especially long term,\\nmultiple,\" ooh, \"et cetera.\"\\n\"Thoughts on hyperbaric O?\"\\nI\\'m so glad you asked\\nthis, Danny Morledge,\\n\"As treatment for TBIs?\"\\nOkay, TBI...\\nNow, one thing about TBI and concussion,\\neveryone thinks football.\\nGuess what?\\nMost of the TBI is not football.\\nThere aren\\'t that many football players,\\nthey\\'re just large so they stand out.\\nThere might be a few here this evening.\\n[audience laughing]\\nOf course, football players are a concern\\nwhen it comes to TBI.\\nMost head injuries are going\\nto be construction workers.\\nHave you ever seen the\\nhard hats they wear?\\nThose, I don\\'t even know if\\nthey are just there for show.\\nIt doesn\\'t make sense.\\nAnd that we actually\\nhave a lab at Stanford\\nthat\\'s focused very hard on\\ntrying to solve this problem.\\nSo, construction workers, car\\naccidents, bicycle accidents.\\nPortland, amazing city to cycle;\\nI\\'m frankly afraid to cycle.\\nYou\\'re a small moving object\\naround these big objects\\nand people are staring\\ninto their little aperture\\non their phone while driving.\\nI mean, whatever happened\\nto that by the way,\\nof not texting while driving?\\nSomehow that just disappeared.\\nIt\\'s like, it really has just disappeared.\\nThere was all this science\\nshowing that it\\'s worse\\nthan drunk driving.\\nTBI.\\nWell, the basic rules\\nof the \"don\\'ts\" apply.\\nIf you get a head injury,\\ndon\\'t get a second head injury.\\nBut that often isn\\'t feasible\\nfor people that need to work,\\ncontinue working in construction,\\nor that are struggling.\\nWhat do we know?\\nWell, this is a great\\nopportunity for me to distinguish\\nmodulatory foundational tools\\nfrom things that directly\\nchange your brain\\nand nervous system the\\nway that you want to.\\nWhat do I mean by modulatory?\\nWe hear so much and\\nthere\\'s so many studies\\nshowing that great\\nsleep, quality nutrition,\\ngood social interactions,\\navoiding chronic stress,\\nand on and on and on are\\nimportant for everything;\\nthey\\'re related to Alzheimer\\'s,\\nthey\\'re related to ADHD.\\nI mean, we could do\\nthousands of podcast episodes\\njust returning to the same 10 things:\\nSleep, don\\'t stress too much or too long,\\ngood social connection, avoid\\ntoxic people, eat good food,\\nnot too much processed food;\\nWe could have an argument all night\\nand I don\\'t want to have one about whether\\nor not it\\'s mainly plants or this.\\nI mean, this is obviously\\neating high quality food\\nis something that we should all be doing,\\nwhich foods you select is a\\ntopic that is very barbed wire,\\nand I can give only my opinions.\\nAll of that modulates your brain function,\\nbut it doesn\\'t mediate or\\nchange anything directly.\\nIt\\'s setting a foundation\\nof what\\'s possible.\\nSo we should all be doing those things,\\nand especially people who have TBI.\\nNow, this question relates\\nto hyperbaric chamber.\\nHyperbaric chamber, there\\'s\\nsome very interesting data.\\nIt\\'s essentially a\\nhyperoxygenation of the brain\\nfor very brief periods of time.\\nI think the data on\\nhyperbaric chamber and TBI\\nare very encouraging.\\nThe problem is, much in the\\nway that a few years ago,\\ncryo was only available in a few places.\\nAnd now people are doing ice baths\\nand cold showers on their own.\\nIt\\'s hard to find a hyperbaric chamber.\\nThey aren\\'t just laying around,\\nand they don\\'t have\\nthem at spas typically,\\nand they are quite expensive.\\nSo, yes, there are\\ninteresting and important data\\nI think on hyperbaric chamber.\\nYou definitely want to\\nwork with a physician\\nor somebody who is very skilled,\\na practitioner who\\'s very\\nskilled in hyperbaric chamber.\\nThey do seem to improve brain\\nfunction by hyperoxygenating\\nthe brain for brief periods of time.\\nIt seems to improve a number\\nof things, but above all,\\nit seems to improve the\\nquality and duration of sleep,\\nwhich indirectly allows\\nthe brain to repair itself,\\nbecause as I mentioned earlier,\\nbrain change largely occurs in sleep.\\nSo if you don\\'t have access\\nto a hyperbaric chamber,\\nbut you do have TBI, what\\nare some of the other data?\\nWhat do those point to?\\nWell, I\\'d go on and on,\\nand you don\\'t have to get\\nthis from supplements,\\nyou can get it from food,\\nbut this threshold level of\\nthese EPA essential fatty acids.\\nThere are now so many data,\\nso much data on the valuable role\\nof these essential EPA fatty acids.\\nThresholds being somewhere\\nbetween one and two grams\\nper day of the EPA.\\nSo much so, actually, that\\nthere are now prescription forms\\nof EPA that doctors are\\nstarting to prescribe\\nfor people with TBI.\\nAlthough for most people\\nyou can get this through...\\nYou can look up and we\\'ve\\ndone podcast episodes\\nabout different ways to access this.\\nAlso functions as an antidepressant;\\nequally good, believe it or not,\\nin clinical trials to SSRIs\\nonce one gets over the one or\\nbasically two grams per day\\nof the EPA.\\nThe resident expert on\\nthe internet about this\\nis pretty extreme about the dosages,\\nand that\\'s Dr. Rhonda\\nPatrick, who by the way,\\ndeserves a nod of\\nacknowledgement and support\\nbecause it turns out that\\nbefore me or David Sinclair\\nor Matt Walker or any of these guys\\nwere blabbing to the world about\\nstuff that they had learned\\nin the archives of science\\nand in their laboratories,\\nthe first person in was this\\nwoman named Rhonda Patrick.\\nAs far as I know, the first\\npublic facing formerly trained\\nscientist to start going\\non all these podcasts\\nand risk her reputation\\nand this kind of stuff\\nthat you deal with when\\nyou put your neck out\\nthere like that.\\nAnd Rhonda\\'s, I think, terrific.\\nWe don\\'t agree on everything\\nand it would be weird if we did,\\nbut I think she\\'s really\\nbeen the proponent\\nof these higher doses of EPAs for TBI\\nand for cognitive function into all ages.\\n\"We often hear about ways\\nto increase dopamine.\\nHowever, are there effective\\nways to decrease dopamine\\nwhen you get too much of\\nit for certain behaviors\\nor habits we want to break?\"\\nKatie Hamm, I think is the last name.\\nThank you, Katie, for your question.\\nYeah, dopamine is a slippery slope.\\nAnd Dr. Anna Lembke is the expert in this,\\nand we\\'ve had a lot of conversations.\\nShe\\'s one of my closer\\nfriends on the faculty.\\nUnfortunately for her,\\nour coffee discussions\\noften last four hours or more.\\nHer poor patients and family.\\nHere\\'s the thing,\\nwhen dopamine is higher\\nin your brain and body,\\nwhen you\\'ve deployed it through excitement\\nor pharmacology or otherwise,\\nit tends to narrow your focus\\nand make you seek more of it\\nin that general theme that\\nyou happen to be focused on.\\nIt could be anything.\\nThat\\'s the scary thing about dopamine.\\nWhat can you do to control\\nit and to reduce it?\\nWell, for those of you\\nthat are engaging in habits\\nthat are healthy,\\nmaybe that doesn\\'t\\nrequire reducing dopamine.\\nHow do you define\\nhealthy versus unhealthy?\\nWell, I think the simplest\\nway to define addiction,\\nat least by my mind,\\nis that addiction is a\\nprogressive narrowing\\nof the things that bring you pleasure.\\nAnd a good life is a progressive expansion\\nof the things that bring you pleasure.\\nA rather simple definition,\\nand yet when we think about\\nthe biology of dopamine,\\ndopamine is not unique to one pursuit.\\nIt\\'s not unique to the pursuit of sex\\nor the pursuit of warmth when you\\'re cold\\nor cool environments when you\\'re too warm\\nor food or social media,\\nit\\'s just a dumb molecule that puts you\\ninto this forward state of\\nmass, small visual aperture,\\nand a kind of obsessive-like nature.\\nWhat can you do to counter that?\\nWell, the best thing to do\\nis to not get into that state too long,\\nbut if you do, the best\\nthing you can do is to try\\nand switch off that system,\\nnot through pharmacology,\\nbut by not pursuing more dopamine.\\nThe day after a big event,\\nthe so-called postpartum depression,\\nnamed of course because of true postpartum\\nafter the delivery of a child.\\nIt\\'s quite common for people\\nto get very, very depressed.\\nThere\\'s a lot of neurochemical\\nand hormonal adjustments\\nthat are occurring,\\nbut different types of\\npostpartum depression occur;\\nafter a big party, the Monday\\nblues, the Sunday blues,\\nthe post-whatever blues.\\nThe four month mark in a\\nrelationship is typically\\nwhen dopamine starts to drop.\\nI always tell people, just wait.\\nI\\'m telling somebody very\\nclose to me right now,\\njust wait four months,\\nfour months, four months,\\nand also spend as much time\\nwith that person as possible.\\nI don\\'t know what this deal is\\nabout not spending as\\nmuch time with people.\\nI think people are afraid\\nthat the dopamine wave pool\\nis just going to pull them both under.\\nI think they\\'ve called that\\nthe escalator model of relationship,\\nwhere you just sort of find\\nyourself in the relationship\\nbecause you went through\\nthe stages without\\nactually deciding on them.\\nIn any event, four months\\nseems to be the stage in which\\nthe dopamine crescendo\\nstarts to relax a little bit,\\nnot in a long distance\\nrelationship, however.\\nWe know this, right?\\nAnticipation is dopamine,\\nthat positive anticipation,\\nand there\\'s a whole\\nbeautiful science of this,\\nand I should say psychology of this.\\nThere\\'s a wonderful book actually.\\nThe name of the book\\nis embarrassing always,\\nI don\\'t know why, for me to say.\\nIt\\'s by a psychologist\\ncalled \"Can Love Last?\",\\nwhich is a psychoanalytic book\\nabout this dopamine-serotonin system\\nand the kind of seesawing back and forth.\\nAnd the fact that in relationships,\\npeople often just slam on\\nthe dopamine side of things\\nand then they hit a wall\\nand want to break up.\\nOr they go into this like warm,\\ncozy, fuzzy feeling thing,\\nand they go, \"Well, I guess\\nthe exciting part is over.\"\\nAnd this idea that one could actually,\\nor two people or however\\nmany people were in Portland\\ncould oscillate this seesaw.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI don\\'t think that you\\nwant to use pharmacology\\nto turn off the dopamine system,\\nbut for people that have\\na hard time sleeping\\nand that are really in\\na state of agitation\\nand constantly obsessing,\\nthe psychiatrists...\\nOne of the oldest and\\nmost effective treatments\\nis that the psychiatrists,\\nand this does have to be prescribed,\\nwe use a very, very low dose\\nof a dopamine receptor blocker,\\nlike Haloperidol, which is\\nused to treat schizophrenia.\\nA very low dose to shut down\\nthe obsession component.\\nThe smart, well-educated psychiatrists\\nknow this as a useful tool,\\nbut this is a one time\\nthing with a very low dose\\nbecause having your\\ndopamine blocked sucks.\\nIt does not feel good,.\\nBut not being able to sleep\\nand being in an obsessive mode also sucks.\\nSo it\\'s actually a very\\npotent clinical tool.\\nSo pharmacology is one tool,\\nbut really at the far end of things.\\nI believe that one should try and modulate\\ntheir own dopamine by\\nnot rewarding one\\'s self\\non a regular basis, but only randomly.\\nRandom intermittent reward\\nis truly the best schedule\\nof reward, hence slot machines and so on.\\nAnd you should engage\\nrandom intermittent reward.\\nAnd I think this is also the\\nway that we should train kids.\\nI call it training kids.\\nYou can tell I don\\'t have kids.\\n[audience laughing]\\nYou don\\'t reward them every time.\\nI don\\'t believe everyone\\nshould get a trophy every time,\\nnor should you always\\njust reward the winners\\nbecause those winners often,\\nwe see cases of this, high\\nprofile cases of this,\\nthey often crash and burn.\\nI mean the number of high performers\\nthat crash and burn publicly\\nand Lord knows how many do\\nit privately is remarkable.\\nIt\\'s \\'cause their dopamine\\nsystem is all messed up.\\nSo random intermittent reward\\nis the schedule of reward\\nthat we should impart on ourselves.\\n\"If you had 10 minutes a day to improve\\nyour brain plasticity, what would you do?\\nAnd when would you do it?\"\\nRichard Conlin, thank you.\\nWell, I\\'m going to say again,\\nI would absolutely anchor my physiology\\nwith morning sunlight viewing.\\nI can\\'t help it.\\nDo you know what\\'s interesting?\\nAnd I\\'ll tell you very briefly,\\nyou know what\\'s special\\nabout morning sunlight?\\nThis low solar angle sunlight.\\nI don\\'t think I\\'ve talked\\nabout this much on social media\\nor on the podcast.\\nThere\\'s a group at the\\nUniversity of Washington,\\na couple, Jay and Maureen Neitz.\\nThey run a lab together.\\nThat sounds like a horrible thing,\\nbut they do it and they\\nget along very well.\\nAnd they\\'ve discovered\\nthat the cells in your eye,\\nthe neurons that set your circadian clock\\nmake you alert during the day\\nand make you sleepy at night,\\nand so on.\\nThose cells respond best\\nto yellow-blue contrast\\nand orange tones.\\nNow, this is important\\nbecause when you go out\\nin the morning, even\\nif it\\'s not at sunrise,\\nbut it\\'s close to sunrise\\nor you look at the sun in the evening,\\nwhat you\\'ll see is yellow-blue\\ncontrast or orange;\\nyellow, blue, orange,\\nthat old thing from\\nkindergarten or first grade.\\nThat\\'s not the color of light\\nthat you\\'re going to see\\nwhen the sun is overhead.\\nNow, this also is really interesting\\nbecause artificial lights,\\nat least to my understanding,\\neven the daylight simulators\\nhave not picked up on this.\\nIt\\'s just about bright light.\\nSomeone ought to design\\nsomething that can mimic this,\\nbut nature has done\\nthis beautifully for us.\\nAnd so viewing low solar\\nangle sunlight in the morning\\nand in the evening is most effective\\nbecause of those yellow-blue contrasts.\\nNow here\\'s the really wild thing.\\nThose circuits that set your\\nlevels of alertness and sleep,\\nyes, they respond best\\nto yellow-blue contrast,\\nbut what that tells us is crazy.\\nWhat that means is that color vision\\nwas probably not related\\nto color perception first\\nbecause all of that is\\ncompletely subconscious.\\nThe pathways that do this\\nare present in people\\nwho are pattern vision blind.\\nSo, what do I mean?\\nI mean that color vision likely evolved\\nfrom a need to synchronize\\nyour internal state\\nwith the external world.\\nAnd the best stimulus in the outside world\\nto do that is yellow-blue contrast.\\nIn other words, our\\nability to detect color\\nwas first and foremost, and\\nwe understand this based on\\nevolutionary genomics and so forth,\\nto extract time of day information,\\nnot color of fruit or color\\nof skin or anything like that.\\nThat\\'s all secondary,\\nwhich is wild and crazy.\\nAnd this is yet another example of the way\\nwe think things work is\\nnot the way they work.\\nIt\\'s completely 180 degrees opposite.\\nI\\'m just going to give\\nyou a little teaser.\\nI had a guest on the podcast,\\nwe haven\\'t aired the episode yet.\\nHis name is Erich Jarvis,\\nhe works on speech and language.\\nHe also was admitted into\\nAlvin Ailey Dance Company.\\nAgain, who are these people?\\nHe\\'s a professor at the Rockefeller.\\nAnyway, I learned from Erich,\\nand you\\'ll learn when\\nthat episode comes out,\\nthat you only find elaborate\\nspeech and language\\nin species that also\\nengage in dance and song.\\nAnd the genomics point to the\\nfact that song and singing\\ncame first and language came second.\\nAnd that led me during that\\nepisode of the podcast,\\nI wrote down in my notes,\\nI was listening to him talk and\\nI wrote down in my notebook,\\nit\\'s just scrawled in big letters.\\nIt says, \"I am so happy right now.\"\\nI was just blown away.\\nAnd it makes so much\\nsense when you hear it,\\nthat the colors in the\\nsky were what our system\\nis trying to extract,\\nnot a perception of\\nthose colors in the sky,\\n\\'cause they\\'re informing us about time\\nand orienting us in time.\\nThat song and the communication\\nof emotional states\\nwould be simpler and more foundational\\nthan communication about\\nspecific patterns of language.\\nWhen you hear it, suddenly it makes sense.\\nBut of course we\\'re human beings,\\nand unless you\\'re Erich Jarvis\\nor Alia Crum or Anna Lembke,\\nyou think about all this\\nstuff backwards, as I do.\\n\"How can I navigate my way\\nthrough taking supplements\\nto optimize my health\\nwhen my career demands,\\nArmy infantry, prevent me\\nfrom being able to establish\\nconsistent routines?\"\\nAndrew Yagen, well thank\\nyou for doing what you do.\\nAndrew, so the consistent\\nroutine thing is tough.\\nHere\\'s what I can say\\nwithout going into a long\\ntwo and a half hour episode\\nabout jet lag and shift work,\\nwhich we\\'ve done.\\nThe most powerful way to anchor\\nyour brain and body in time\\nis indeed viewing sunlight\\nat consistent times of day.\\nThat\\'s not something I made up.\\nWe know this based on a\\nlot of work that dates back\\nto the 1930s.\\nThe second most powerful\\nstimulus is going to be movement\\nand changes in body temperature.\\nIn particular, increases\\nin body temperature\\ntend to make us alert,\\nand decreases in body temperature\\ntend to make us sleepy.\\nBody temperature drops\\none to three degrees\\nto get us into sleep.\\nWhy does a cold shower wake you up?\\nAdrenaline is released\\nand believe it or not,\\nyour body is heating up\\ninternally to combat that cold,\\nunless you make yourself hypothermic.\\nSo, sauna, hot baths to get sleepy,\\ncold showers, ice baths,\\net cetera to wake up.\\nSort of obvious when you hear it,\\nbut it\\'s counterintuitive\\nbecause you think,\\noh, heating up the body to wake up\\nand cooling down the body to go to sleep.\\nSo getting into cold\\nought to cool me down,\\nbut your body compensates\\njust like if you threw a\\ncold towel on a thermostat,\\nyou\\'d crank up the temperature in the room\\nand vice versa for heat.\\nOkay, so what do you do?\\nYou want to try and use\\nas many of these things,\\nlight, temperature, exercise, food.\\nWhen you eat is typically\\nassociated with waking.\\nVery few of us are capable\\nof eating in our sleep.\\nAnd then the other one is\\nsocial activity and rhythms.\\nNow the discombobulated person\\nis going to be the person\\nthat has not aligned these\\nthings in a consistent way.\\nSo while schedules vary,\\nand Andrew, I don\\'t know\\nyour exact schedule,\\nwhat I can say is if you\\nsuddenly go from daytime behavior\\nand sleeping at night to\\nthe so-called vampire shift,\\nas it\\'s called in the military,\\nand suddenly you\\'re up in\\nthe middle of the night\\nand you\\'re sleeping during the day,\\nthen when you come off that shift,\\nwhat you want to do is try\\nand combine as many of those\\nsame things at one time.\\nSo it would be get your sunlight,\\nso go jogging without your sunglasses,\\ndrink your coffee, engage with\\nother people and communicate,\\neat a meal afterwards or\\nas the case may be before.\\nTry and bring as many\\nof those things together\\nat the same time of day for a few days\\nand pretty soon your system\\nwill map around that.\\nSo the reason I encourage for those of us\\nthat are not doing shift work\\nto try and be fairly consistent\\nabout sunlight viewing\\nis it sets in motion\\neverything else that\\'s correct,\\nin terms of timing of\\neating, appetite will follow,\\nwhen your alert will follow.\\nYou\\'ll start to learn your own rhythms.\\nWhen you can\\'t control your schedule,\\ntry and combine as many of those cues;\\nagain, light, temperature, exercise, food,\\nsocial engagement into one period of time\\nand try and lock that into a more or less\\na one or two hour period or\\nplus or minus one or two hours\\nat a particular time of day\\nfor at least two or three days.\\nAnd your schedule, meaning\\nyour internal clocks\\nwill lock to that.\\n\"How is social media changing our brains?\"\\nThomas Adcock.\\nWell, you hear all the terrible ways\\nin which it\\'s changing our brains.\\nAnd I think that again,\\nwe go back to this thing,\\nis it the aperture that we\\'re looking at?\\nSo is it the format that\\nwe\\'re engaging in things?\\nOr is it the content?\\nWell, the way I like to\\nthink about the phone\\nis the way that we\\'ve been\\nengaging with the phone\\nand the laptop for that matter,\\nin staring into the small\\nvisual aperture each day\\nis sort of like walking like\\nthis all day long, right?\\nWe have this amazing\\nability to shuffle our feet\\nand take small steps\\nor to take big strides,\\nto run, to move...\\nI think that\\'s the sagittal\\nplane for movement.\\nI know it for the brain,\\nbut I always mess it.\\nThe PTs are vicious\\npeople online, by the way.\\nThe PTs and nutrition people,\\nI\\'ve learned to just not\\nsay anything about that.\\nI\\'m not a PT and I\\'m not\\na physical therapist.\\nAnd they do incredible\\nwork, but they\\'re like,\\nit\\'s a very spirited crowd.\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd the nutrition thing is really weird.\\nI mean, it\\'s just incredible.\\nPeople are either throwing liver at you\\nor they\\'re throwing celery at you\\nor they\\'re fasting or they\\'re not fasting.\\nIt\\'s nuts.\\nIn any case, the social media\\nand staring at a small visual aperture\\nis changing our brains.\\nHere\\'s one way I know in\\nwhich it\\'s changing our brains\\nand then I\\'ll tell you how to fix it.\\nIf you stare or look at\\nsomething within two feet of you\\nfor a certain number of hours each day,\\nyour eyeball actually gets longer.\\nAnd the visual image then is focused\\nin front of your neural retina,\\nnot onto your neural retina,\\nand you are becoming myopic; nearsighted.\\nAnd if you look at things\\nin the distance enough,\\nguess what?\\nYour eyeball changes shape\\nand your lens will focus\\nappropriately the image onto your retina.\\nIt takes some work.\\nKids that look at things\\nup close too much,\\nand adults that look at\\nthings up close too much\\nbecome nearsighted.\\nAnd there\\'s a beautiful\\nset of clinical trials now\\nwhere mainly in kids,\\nif kids get outside for two hours a day,\\ngetting a lot of this UVB and blue light\\nthat we\\'re told is so terrible for us,\\nbut they get it from sunlight,\\nthey actually can reverse myopia,\\nor reduce the incidence of\\nmyopia, maybe even glaucoma.\\nAlthough that\\'s a big maybe.\\nSo, how much staring into\\na small visual aperture\\nis too much?\\nI don\\'t know.\\nBut what we do know is that we\\nare literally becoming myopic\\nin terms of our vision\\nand we\\'re becoming myopic\\nin terms of our cognition.\\nAnd then there\\'s the whole business\\nof what\\'s actually\\ncontained in those Tweets\\nand those social media feeds\\nand those news stories.\\nWhich frankly, I feel\\nlike you lose either way,\\nwhether or not you\\'re\\nin one political camp\\nor another political camp,\\nyou\\'re upset about half of\\nthe information out there.\\nSo I feel like, and I\\'m\\nnot someone who knows\\nhow to talk about politics\\nwithout stumbling,\\nI didn\\'t do well in social\\nstudies in this sort of thing.\\nIt just never made sense to me.\\nIt just felt like the\\nprize goes to the person\\nwho can shout the loudest\\nand the most coherently\\nfor a moment.\\nBut I encourage, of course,\\npeople to be politically active.\\nAnd I vote.\\n[audience laughing]\\nBut the content is tricky to navigate.\\nAnd I can\\'t really speak to that,\\nexcept that it seems to\\nbe bothering everybody\\non one side or the other or in the middle.\\nAnd the format is something\\nthat we really understand.\\nAnd again, I don\\'t know of\\nmany people that are talking\\nabout this narrow visual\\nwindow format thing.\\nIt came up more during the\\nlockdowns when we were all inside\\na lot and not looking out at a distance.\\nThe data say really to try\\nand get at least 10 minutes\\nof long distance viewing,\\nso longer than 10 feet away from us,\\nfor every 30 minutes of closeup viewing.\\nAnd not a lot of us are doing that.\\nIf you\\'re walking to your\\ncar looking at your phone,\\nyou\\'re definitely losing an opportunity.\\n\"What new piece of neurological research\\nare you most excited about?\\nMateo Minato.\\nOoh.\\nI think the piece of\\nneurological research that I...\\nAll right, the weird stuff.\\nI\\'ve got this colleague at Stanford,\\nTony Wyss-Coray, and they\\'re\\nreally into literally taking\\nproteins from young blood\\nand young spinal cord\\ncerebral spinal fluid\\nand putting it into\\nolder people and animals,\\nand they get younger.\\nThat stuff\\'s pretty wild.\\nThe fecal transplant stuff is pretty wild.\\nYou take the microbiome from\\none person and as it sounds,\\nyou transplant it to somebody else\\nand they take on the physical\\ncharacteristics of the donor.\\nIt\\'s crazy.\\nUntil I talk to my [chuckling]...\\nThere\\'s some shouts for fecal transplant.\\nNice.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI have never read the method\\nsections of those papers.\\nI\\'m actually afraid to\\nread the method sections.\\nI would say this is not neurological,\\nbut the work from Chris\\nGardner and Justin Sonnenburg,\\nalso at Stanford,\\nit makes it sound like I just like,\\n\"Stanford, Stanford, Stanford.\"\\nBut these are the people I\\'m\\nclosest to and surrounded by.\\nThere are excellent places\\neverywhere, of course,\\nincluding OHSU and I\\'m not just\\nsaying that \\'cause I\\'m here.\\nI actually close colleagues\\nhere and friends here at OHSU.\\nAlso an amazing, although\\nthat tram thing freaks me out,\\nit\\'s like I always just\\nhave all these ideas\\nabout what\\'s going to\\nhappen if that thing breaks.\\nBut the microbiome data\\nare really interesting.\\nI never understood why\\ngetting your gut microbiome\\nwas important.\\nAnd it turns out it\\'s because\\nyour gut actually makes\\nmany of the neurotransmitter precursors\\nthat your brain uses.\\nSo that\\'s pretty cool.\\nAnd I always thought it\\nwould be a complicated thing\\nto get your gut microbiome right,\\nbut it turns out that it\\'s fermented foods\\nthat seem to have the biggest effect.\\nThere was all this argument\\nabout fiber and yes,\\nfiber is important and\\nhere I\\'m getting nervous\\ntalking about nutrition,\\n\\'cause the people are going\\nto come at me with fiber.\\nBut it\\'s very clear from\\nJustin and Chris\\'s data\\nthat people who are\\ngetting four servings a day\\nof fermented foods,\\nwhether or not it\\'s kimchi\\nor sauerkraut or kombucha,\\nthat stuff actually seems to encourage\\na healthy gut microbiome\\nand people feel better,\\nand their immune system works better.\\nAnd I like this because it actually,\\nit resolves an issue which\\nis that high dose probiotics,\\nthese very expensive need\\nto be refrigerated things,\\nthose actually can create brain\\nfog and other issues there\\nfor real severe cases of dysbiosis.\\nSo I always like an instance\\nwhere one can look to foods\\nwhich are good, \\'cause I like to eat,\\nin order to resolve these issues.\\nIn terms of other neurologic issues,\\nfrankly, I think the stuff on dopamine\\nis fundamentally important.\\nSo much addiction, that\\'s a severe case,\\nbut also so much waxing\\nand waning of motivation.\\nAnd once you understand the\\ndopamine system and you say,\\n\"What activities am I engaging in\\nor pharmacology am I engaging in?\\nWhat am I doing to spike dopamine?\"\\nYou start to go, \"Oh, I get it.\\nThe waves in this wave pool are too high\\nand that\\'s why I can\\'t\\ndo this consistently.\"\\nAnd then you do the counterintuitive thing\\nof approaching things with\\na little less excitement,\\nbut then you\\'re able to\\ndo them more consistently.\\nIt\\'s like, \"Ah!\"\\nAnd maybe with some luck, I\\'ll\\nend up finishing this book\\nthat I\\'ve been working on\\nfor four and a half years\\nas a consequence \\'cause I can\\'t seem to.\\n\"Thinking about the Wim Hof Method.\\nDo you believe it?\\nHow is it really working?\\nWhat process is happening in his brain?\"\\nOh, boy.\\nMadison Cameron and everyone\\nhere probably familiar\\nwith Wim Hof.\\nWhose occupation on Wikipedia\\nused to be \"Daredevil.\"\\nThat was cool.\\nIt\\'s like Evel Knievel\\nhad it and Wim had it.\\nI got a story about Wim.\\nActually in 2016, I heard\\nabout this guy, Wim Hof,\\nand I got a hold of him,\\nactually his children.\\nAnd I had one vacation that\\nyear and I flew to Spain\\nand I spent some time\\nmountaineering with Wim,\\nwhich was absolutely terrifying.\\nI almost lost a leg legitimately.\\nI tied in wrong on a bridge sling.\\nHe told me it was good for me.\\nHe told me to, \"Stare\\ninto the lizard\\'s eyes.\"\\nAnd I stared into the lizard\\'s eyes.\\nI jumped backwards off this\\nhomemade bridge sling thing.\\nAnd I had the rope wrapped through my leg\\nand I came back with basically the tendon\\non the back of my knee exposed.\\nAnd sitting next to me on the plane\\nwas our Vice Dean of Research at Stanford.\\nAnd I had to explain to him\\nwhat I was doing and why.\\nIt was very embarrassing.\\nWhat did we do on that trip?\\nWell, a couple of things that will help me\\nanswer your question.\\nFirst of all, when I arrived,\\nI suffered terribly from jet lag,\\nbut the moment I got there,\\nWim did not say hello.\\nHe literally told me to\\nget into the ice bath.\\nAnd I did 10 minutes in the\\nice bath not because I\\'m tough,\\nbut because he held me\\ndown in the ice bath.\\nHe is indeed one of the\\nstrongest human beings.\\nHe reminds me of the bus\\ndriver on \"The Simpsons\"\\nor the janitor, excuse me.\\nNo, Otto is the bus driver, right?\\nThe janitor on \"The Simpsons,\"\\nlike [grunts] that guy.\\nThat\\'s Wim.\\nIncredibly physically strong guy.\\nWhat do I think\\'s going\\non with Wim Hof stuff?\\nWell, Wim Hof, whether or\\nnot he understands it or not,\\nI always think he\\'s sort of\\nthe Bob Dylan of breathwork.\\nLike everything he says seems\\nto have some intuitive sense,\\nbut you don\\'t really\\nunderstand what in the world\\nhe\\'s saying.\\n[audience laughing]\\nHe\\'s going to come after me now.\\nWe\\'ve had a good but\\ncomplicated relationship,\\nI\\'ll just confess.\\nMaybe someday we\\'ll resolve that.\\nNo big scandal or story there,\\njust we communicate very differently.\\nWim has a couple methods.\\nOne is to deliberately hyperventilate.\\nThis is also called Tummo breathing.\\nMy lab actually studies this.\\nWe have a paper that I\\'m happy\\nto share with you the results\\nalthough they\\'re not published yet,\\nwhere people do deliberate\\ncyclic hyperventilation.\\nWhich as the name suggests,\\nyou just breathe really deeply in\\nand really deeply out 25 times.\\nOr if you\\'re Wim, you\\'d say, \"In and out.\\nIn and out.\"\\nI just tell people, here\\'s how it works.\\nYou go [deeply breathing].\\nYou do that 25 times and you heat up\\nand you feel really agitated,\\nand that\\'s because of adrenaline.\\nIf you throw yourself into an ice bath\\nor a cold shower, adrenaline.\\nIf somebody upsets you\\nor you get a triggering text, adrenaline.\\nAdrenaline sounds like a terrible thing,\\nexcept when you deliberately induce it.\\nAs my colleague, David Spiegel says,\\n\"There\\'s a big difference\\nbetween going into a state\\nand you controlling your\\nentry into a state.\"\\nSo it\\'s not just about\\nthe state you\\'re in,\\nit\\'s about how you got\\nthere and whether or not\\nyou had anything to do with it.\\nStates of high adrenaline\\nare very powerful.\\nWhen you self induce\\nadrenaline by cold shower,\\ncyclic hyperventilation,\\nAKA Wim Hof breathing\\nor Tummo breathing,\\nyou then have an opportunity to create\\na very distinct mind-body relationship.\\nWe all hear that interoception\\nand the mind-body relationship.\\nInteroception just your ability\\nto sense your heartbeats\\nand what\\'s going on in your body.\\nPowerful, right?\\nTerrible if how you feel sucks.\\nSo interoception is wonderful,\\nbut when you\\'re anxious it\\nactually is more adaptive\\nto be able to maintain your thinking\\nand get yourself out\\nof that anxious state.\\nSo if you\\'re trembling and\\nyour body\\'s freaking out\\nand your cheeks are flushing\\nand your brain is following\\nyour bodily state,\\nwell, that\\'s not good.\\nAnd if you\\'re somebody and sadly,\\nthis happens a lot where you\\'ve\\nexperienced a lot of trauma\\nor typically this is people\\nthat have been bombarded\\nwith extreme criticism or physical abuse\\nor other kinds of abuse\\nduring development.\\nThey actually can seem very calm,\\nbut internally they\\'re\\nfreaking out in their head.\\nAnd they\\'re just thinking,\\njust get me through this.\\nAnd they just go into a state\\nwhere no one knows they\\'re upset.\\nI\\'ve known people like\\nthis and it\\'s eerie to me\\nbecause I\\'ve never had\\nthat response to stress,\\nbut it\\'s very common.\\nAnd so we should learn and\\nbe careful about deciding\\nthat people are in one state or another\\nbased on their bodily or\\ntheir mental response.\\nVim Hof breathing, cold\\nshowers, et cetera,\\nare a great practice in my opinion,\\nbecause they allow you\\nto spike your adrenaline.\\nAnd you can do that, for instance,\\nby making the water colder\\nif you want more adrenaline,\\nstaying in longer if you\\nwant more adrenaline,\\nmoving your limbs around in the water\\nwill give you more adrenaline\\n\\'cause it breaks up that thermal layer.\\nIt makes it a lot colder.\\nOr doing 50 deep inhales and exhales.\\nThat is very useful because\\nthen you have the opportunity\\nto use that prefrontal cortex and to stop\\nand sense all that adrenaline in your body\\nand yet maintain clarity of mind.\\nAnd that\\'s an absolutely powerful tool.\\nI would even call it a power tool.\\nAnd Wim figured this out.\\nI don\\'t know if you know this,\\nbut the way that Wim discovered all this\\nwas he was in deep grief about\\nthe tragic death of his wife.\\nShe committed suicide, jumped\\noff an eight story building.\\nJust truly tragic death.\\nAnd he was in situation, he\\nhad four children at the time.\\nNow, he has five.\\nAnd he was in a state of depression\\nand he ended up going into\\nthe canal in Amsterdam\\nand it was very cold and\\nit shocked his system.\\nAnd in that shock to his system,\\nwhich is caused by adrenaline,\\nhe somehow was able to anchor his thinking\\nand in kind of genius\\nof sorts, Wim thought,\\n\"Wow, I can intervene in my physiology\\nwith this strange activity.\"\\nAnd then he realized that\\nbreathing would do it as well.\\nYou didn\\'t have to get into cold water.\\nAnd then, years later, we discovered,\\nnot we meaning my lab, but other labs,\\nthat when you get into cold water,\\neven just 60 degree water,\\nthat there\\'s a very long\\nlasting increase in dopamine.\\nThat is 2.5x above baseline,\\nwhich is on par with\\nsome prescription drugs\\nfor increasing dopamine.\\nSo when people laugh at me and go,\\n\"Oh this cold water thing,\"\\nI get teased a lot on the internet.\\nI\\'ve heard on the internet\\nthat I eat sticks of butter,\\nwhich I never said.\\nI said, \"I like butter.\"\\n[audience laughing]\\nI\\'ve been told all sorts of things.\\nI\\'ve been told I eat sticks of butter.\\nI don\\'t know why.\\nI\\'ve been told that I\\'m dead.\\nThat was an interesting one.\\nThat was one of the cooler ones.\\nBut when I was going out\\nthere as a serious scientist\\nand saying, \"Using\\ndeliberate cold exposure.\"\\nYou can use all sorts of things.\\nOr if you come to my lab,\\nI\\'d be happy to put you in VR\\nand expose you to all\\nsorts of scary stuff.\\nOr we can inject you with adrenaline\\nor you can inject yourself with adrenaline\\nand titrate that, adjust\\nthe levels of that.\\nSo it\\'s a very powerful tool.\\nAnd I think that Wim and\\nothers deserve credit\\nfor really tapping into that.\\nAnd as a last point,\\nthere\\'s a beautiful study\\nin the Proceedings of the\\nNational Academy of Sciences\\nyears ago using this deliberate\\ncyclic hyperventilation\\nthing; 25 breath [deeply breathing].\\nAnd then another group meditates.\\nAnd then they inject\\nthem both with E. coli.\\nAnd the people injected\\nwith E. coli who meditate\\nget nauseous, vomit, diarrhea,\\nand they get a fever.\\nAnd the people who\\n[deeply breathing] first,\\nfar fewer symptoms, if any.\\nWhy?\\nBecause adrenaline actually\\nsuppresses a lot of these\\ninnate immune responses\\nin a way that\\'s healthy\\nin the short term.\\nThis is why you can work,\\nwork, work, work, work,\\nwhere you can study for finals,\\nor you can take care of a loved one\\nand then you finally stop\\nand rest and go on vacation,\\nand then you get sick.\\nStress activates your nervous\\nsystem and in doing so,\\nit activates your immune system.\\nMakes perfect sense\\nwhen you think about it.\\nHow would we ever go through famine\\nif you\\'re just getting flus\\nwhenever you\\'re stressed?\\nWe can deal with a lot.\\nMy suggestion is if you\\'re coming off\\na period of high stress,\\nto do some sort of\\nadrenaline spiking behavior\\nas you taper out of that stressful period,\\nnot going strictly to massage, vacation,\\nand yoga nidra all day long,\\nas I would reflexively do.\\n\"Can red light therapy help\\ntreat exercise intolerance\\nand fatigue in mitochondrial disease?\"\\nAllison, I\\'m glad you brought this up.\\nThis is another case where I thought,\\n\"Oh no, this red light stuff is crazy.\"\\nAnd then I went into the\\nliterature and it turns out\\nthat in 1908, the Nobel\\nPrize was actually given\\nfor phototherapy.\\nSo, there we go again.\\nAnd I have this slide,\\nI chose not to use slides tonight,\\nbut I have this slide that shows Ken Kesey\\nand the magic bus and\\nstuff from the 1930s,\\nand psychedelics and people\\ngetting into cold water.\\nAnd then here we are, 2019,\\n2020, you\\'ve got Wim Hof,\\nand Matt Johnson giving people\\nmacro doses of psilocybin.\\nWe\\'re right back where we were.\\nAnd one of my major goals is to really try\\nand create some scientific\\ndiscussion around these things.\\nThis stuff is crazy on the face of it,\\nbut there are mechanisms that\\nare real that underlie it.\\nRed light, because it\\'s\\nlong wavelength light,\\nlonger literally as opposed\\nto a short wavelength light,\\ncan penetrate through things like skin\\nand can indeed change mitochondria.\\nOne of the more impressive\\nresults on red light\\ncomes from my good\\nfriend, Glen Jeffery\\'s Lab\\nat the University College London.\\nI\\'ve known Glen for years,\\nand a few years, he was\\na basic vision scientist.\\nAnd a few years ago he\\nstarted using red light.\\nHe\\'d have people look at red light\\nat a distance of about\\ntwo feet in the morning.\\nSo is long wavelength light.\\nAnd sometimes even just take a flashlight,\\na torch as they call it in England,\\nand cover it with a red film.\\nAnd they would look at this stuff\\nfor a few minutes each morning,\\nand it can reverse some forms\\nof age-related vision loss\\nand macular degeneration.\\nHow we now know it can\\nprove mitochondrial function\\nin photoreceptors by\\nreducing what are called\\nreactive oxygen species.\\nHere\\'s what\\'s interesting,\\nit only seems to work\\nin people older than 40,\\nand it seems to only\\nwork if you do it within\\nthe first three hours of waking.\\nAnd the incredible\\nthing is you can do this\\nfor one or two minutes a week,\\nand some of the positive effects last\\nas long as three weeks.\\nAnd it\\'s affecting a very specific form\\nof visual improvement, which is acuity,\\nkind of fine detail stuff\\nin a particular wavelength.\\nSo, particular colors\\nand objects and things.\\nPretty impressive.\\nSo, yes, red light can\\nimprove mitochondrial function\\nto the photo receptors.\\nIf you are going to try and do this stuff,\\ndon\\'t put it too close.\\nI don\\'t have any affiliation\\nto any red light panel company.\\nSo I can\\'t say anything there.\\nThey are rather expensive.\\nNowadays, people are putting\\nred light everywhere,\\nand I do mean everywhere.\\nPeople are putting red\\nlight on their stomach\\nfor improving ovarian function,\\nwhether or not it can\\npenetrate isn\\'t clear to me\\nall the way down there.\\nPeople are trying to do this.\\nI have a friend, I won\\'t name him.\\nRecently, he told me he is really into\\nthe red light therapy.\\nHe\\'s putting it on his testicles\\nto try and increase testosterone.\\nBut he told me that after\\nhe handed me the red light.\\n[audience laughing]\\nTrue story.\\nMy team knows who this is.\\nIt\\'s no one on my team.\\nThank goodness.\\nI was like, \"Oh, that\\'s\\nsuper interesting.\"\\nI actually don\\'t think you\\nwant to contact the red lights\\ndirectly to your skin.\\nSo red light is powerful.\\nI don\\'t think we have, aside\\nfrom the vision protocol,\\nI don\\'t think that it\\'s clear\\nwhich protocols are best.\\nI will say if you\\'re into\\nred light infrared sauna.\\nTypically those don\\'t get hot enough.\\nTypically if you want to\\nget the benefits of sauna,\\nyou want to get between 80\\nand 100 degrees Celsius,\\nwhich is 176 to 210 or 208 Fahrenheit.\\nAnd I don\\'t actually do\\nthe conversion in my head.\\nI memorize it.\\n\"You mentioned the consequences\\nof blasting your brain\\nwith too much dopamine.\\nIs it possible to overdo\\nice baths while following\\nthe same line of thinking?\\nWill you experience an\\nextreme low in dopamine\\nwith too many ice baths?\"\\nLucas Ancke, thank you for the question.\\nAny behavior that spikes adrenaline,\\nyou will eventually get\\nbetter at tolerating it.\\nYou will become cold adapted\\nand you\\'ll become comfortable\\nat high adrenaline states.\\nAnd you just have to ask yourself this,\\nit\\'s just like lifting\\nweights in the gym or running.\\nYou need to leave some\\nspace for improvement.\\nSo if you run, as people do,\\nand you do your 5k, then you\\'re 10k,\\nthen you\\'re half marathon,\\nmaybe a 10k is a half marathon.\\nI don\\'t know.\\nBut anyway, then you\\'re\\ndoing your marathon.\\nThen you\\'re doing ultras that\\nare 50 miles and 100 miles.\\nI mean, eventually you\\'re going\\nto start doing damage, right?\\nAnd eventually you look\\nat every ultra runner\\nand typically these are\\npeople who are very much\\non the dopamine pursuit system.\\nI mean, I don\\'t think that he would mind;\\nmy good friend and a podcaster\\nwho I have tremendous\\nrespect for is Rich Roll,\\namazing human being,\\nand also has an amazing\\nstory about addiction.\\nHe was an alcoholic.\\nAnd I\\'m not sharing anything\\nthat he hasn\\'t already shared\\nin his amazing book, \"Finding Ultra.\"\\nHe got really into running,\\nrunning, running all the time\\nand there\\'s a dopamine\\nhistory there for him.\\nSome of us can use ice\\nbaths so consistently\\nand making it so cold and\\ndoing them longer and longer\\nthat indeed you\\'re playing\\nwith the dopamine system.\\nIs it bad?\\nWell, it depends on what\\nyou\\'re trading that in for,\\nat the expense of what?\\nIs it giving up cocaine?\\nYeah, great, stick with the ice bath.\\nBut you know, can only make it so cold\\nand you can only stay in there so long\\nbefore you become Wim Hof, right?\\nAnd it worked out for Wim,\\nbut there\\'s really only one Wim Hof.\\nAnd in general, that\\nspeaks to a larger theme,\\nwhich is I love the idea\\nof people using tools\\nand understanding mechanism.\\nI mean, of course I love that.\\nIt\\'s what I talk about and\\nthink about so much in my life.\\nBut for most of us,\\nwe don\\'t make a living doing those things.\\nAnd so I do think that the ideal situation\\nis to have behaviors and\\ntools that you intersperse\\nthroughout your day and\\nthroughout the week.\\nFor instance, I think\\nthree times a week is fine\\nfor the ice bath.\\nNo one said you had to do it every day,\\nbut you should see sunlight\\nevery morning if you can.\\nJust because if you miss a\\nday, your system will be fine,\\njust spend twice as long\\noutside the next day.\\nSeriously, \\'cause it\\'s a\\nslow integrating system.\\nBut for most of these\\nhigh intensity things,\\nthe less often you do them,\\nthe more powerful they are.\\nIn fact, if you get into a very hot sauna\\nfor four 30 minute sessions on one day.\\nSo you go 30 minutes,\\nget out for five minutes.\\n30 minutes, get out for five minutes.\\n30 minutes, get out for five.\\nTwo hours a day in the\\nsauna, that\\'s a lot of sauna,\\nbut the growth hormone release\\nfrom that type of protocol\\nis a 16x increase in growth hormone.\\nThis has been measured in humans.\\nWhereas if you do it every day\\nor three or four times a week,\\nyou get diminishing returns on that.\\nSo I actually am a big fan\\nof doing really intense stuff\\nonly every once in a while.\\nThis is also why I only\\ntake one long run per week\\nor one long hike.\\nFirst of all, I don\\'t have time for it.\\nI\\'m not an ultra runner.\\nI got other things to do.\\nAnd second of all, it\\'s a strong stimulus.\\nI\\'m sore until Tuesday,\\nor I don\\'t want to run\\nuntil Tuesday anyway.\\nI actually think that\\'s fine.\\nAnd I actually encourage\\nkind of more healthy,\\nrational schedules of\\nthese kinds of behaviors.\\nThere\\'s no rule that says\\nyou have to do something\\nevery day, even if you\\'re trying\\nto engage neuroplasticity.\\nYou can learn French or an\\ninstrument by practicing\\nthree times a week.\\nAs long as your practice\\nis very focused, right?\\nDaily perhaps would be better,\\nbut very few of us have the opportunity\\nto do things every day consistently.\\nAnd I really want to encourage\\na more balanced approach.\\n\"Before working for\\nThrasher, what\\'s the best...\"\\nOh, goodness gracious.\\nThe skateboarders are always in the house.\\nMy first non-biological family\\nwas a skateboarding community.\\nWhen I have great relationship\\nwith my parents now,\\nbut because there was a\\ntime when there was no one\\nto go to soccer games\\nor do any of that stuff,\\nthe skateboard community took me in\\n\\'cause there were no parents involved.\\nIt was great.\\nThere were no referees or coaches\\n\\'cause I didn\\'t like\\nauthority and it was awesome.\\nAnd there was no nutritional plan.\\nYou drank your slurpy\\nand you sat on the curb,\\nand it was fantastic.\\nI don\\'t do that anymore.\\nBut the skateboarding community\\'s\\none that I\\'ve remained close with.\\nI did write for Thrasher\\nunder a different name\\nwhile I was a postdoc\\nto make some extra cash.\\nYou won\\'t find those\\narticles anywhere, I hope.\\nThey\\'re not very good.\\nAnd the best skate trick?\\nWell, I was involved in it\\nenough that this will only\\nmakes sense like three\\npeople in the audience,\\nbut I had decent heel flip.\\nI could nollie better than I could ollie.\\nAnd I was never very good.\\nOh, there\\'s more\\nskateboarders in the audience.\\nWhat I will say though,\\nis you have to be very\\ncareful with skateboarders,\\n\\'cause I don\\'t want to\\nclaim that I was any good.\\nAny success that I had was\\nout of sympathy of others\\nfor letting me hang around.\\nIt\\'s a great community.\\nAnd it gave me great\\nappreciation for indeed\\ncommunities of kids that\\ndon\\'t have structure\\nand sports leagues and teams\\nand all that kind of stuff.\\nNowadays, it\\'s actually a\\nmuch different landscape.\\nAnd I have to also say that\\nit\\'s really amazing to see\\nall the incredible girls and\\nwomen skateboarders also.\\nThere were none.\\nIt\\'s an Olympic sport\\nnow for women and girls,\\nand it\\'s an Olympic sport\\nfor boys of men too.\\nSo, it\\'s awesome to see that community.\\nOkay, \"What are your favorite brain hacks\\nfor doing hard things?\\nRanging from cold exposure to\\ngetting through selection?\"\\nHoby Darling, thanks for the question.\\nYeah, hard things.\\nWell, I\\'ll be honest.\\nI learned how to hack\\ninto my adrenaline system\\na long time ago through the\\nworst possible mechanism,\\nwhich is that I would set\\nup battles in my mind.\\nI would get into competition\\nwith people, imagined or real,\\nor I would get into states of\\nfearing shame and screwing up.\\nSo, this is what a lot\\nof people do I think,\\nyou end up scaring\\nyourself into trying to do\\nthe hard thing, and it works.\\nThe problem is it feels\\nrather like a downward spiral\\nbecause those negative states of mind\\nwork to liberate adrenaline and\\nget you through hard things.\\nSo being a kind of rebellious\\nkid, resistance was...\\nIf someone told me I couldn\\'t\\ndo something, I was like,\\n\"Yeah, try me\" and this kind of thing.\\nAnd as I mentioned before, I\\nwasn\\'t crazy about authority.\\nAnd so, that was the\\nmethod for a long time.\\nAnd then, I started reading\\nOliver Sacks\\'s books\\nand I started learning\\nfrom people who seemed\\nto access things through\\nthis whole love thing.\\nAnd I tried that love and\\nkindness meditation thing,\\nand that didn\\'t work.\\nAnd what I started doing was I actually,\\nI\\'ll just tell you before\\nI came out here tonight\\nand before I do anything challenging,\\nI just actually like to imagine the people\\nthat have supported me.\\nIt\\'s a weird tool.\\nI don\\'t think I\\'ve ever shared.\\nI\\'m actually slightly\\nembarrassed to share this out.\\n\\'Cause there are only two\\nthings that make me cry,\\nand that\\'s talking about my bulldog\\nand talking about my graduate advisor.\\nAnd if I talk it about any\\nlonger, I\\'ll probably cry.\\nBut I think about them a lot\\nbecause they were kind of similar.\\nThey were kind of ornery\\nand they were hard on me,\\nand I adored them both.\\nAnd so these days I try\\nand think about people\\nthat really, that I love.\\nAnd so I have been trying\\nto do this whole, like,\\ndoing things from a place of love thing.\\nAnd so, for me, that\\'s animals\\nand people that I love.\\nAnd okay, now, I better move on.\\nAh, thank you.\\n[audience applauding]\\nOkay, they\\'re telling\\nme one more question.\\nSo I\\'m going to answer one more.\\n\"What do I fear?\\nHow do you manage your fear?\"\\nKB, oh, gosh.\\nThis is going to turn into a\\nno one\\'s going to be satisfied\\nuntil I cry.\\nI get it, I get it.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI do cry, but again about the\\nthings I mentioned before.\\nI realized something, by the way.\\nWe just recorded an episode on grief.\\nIt hasn\\'t come out yet.\\nFascinating topic.\\nI realized at one point, by the way,\\nI\\'ll just give this away,\\nthat I thought I was really\\nsad about losing them.\\nI thought I would tear up really easily\\nbecause I was sad about them.\\nBut then I realized that this,\\ngosh, I can\\'t believe\\nI\\'m going to do this.\\nBut I realized that\\nfeeling that I was feeling\\nis the exact same feeling of love\\nthat I had when they were alive.\\nSo, grief is love.\\nAnd when you look at the literature,\\nit\\'s basically that, but\\nyour brain is freaking out\\nbecause that map of knowing\\nwhere people are in space\\nand time, grief is basically\\na remapping of the space:\\nWhere are they?\\nTime: When are they?\\nAnd then, this kind of\\nabstract map representation\\nthat we call closeness.\\nAnd grief is this process of\\nripping ourselves off of that.\\nSo, in any event, what do I fear?\\nTalking about things like this.\\nWhat do I fear?\\nQuite honestly, my biggest fear,\\nthe thing that would just\\nmake me feel just horrible\\nis I fear letting down my friends.\\nI have an amazing...\\nI love my family and they\\'re wonderful,\\nbut I have this incredible\\nrelationship to friendship,\\nand I adore my friends\\nand I would sooner give up\\nall my limbs and die before I would\\ndeliberately let them down.\\nSo, there you go, that\\'s what I fear most.\\n[audience applauding]\\nThank you.\\nThank you.\\nI also fear I\\'ve gone long.\\nAnd so my team has shut this down.\\nI just want to just briefly, two things.\\nFirst of all, I of course\\nwant to thank everyone\\nfor coming here tonight.\\nI realize it\\'s the middle of the week\\nand to commit some hours of your life\\nto thinking about these brain mechanisms,\\nwe got pretty nerdy there for a minute,\\nand hopefully the tools redeemed those\\nwho were only interested\\nor mostly interested\\nin practical tools,\\nbut hopefully some of the\\ninsights about how you work\\nwere useful as well.\\nI do want to just make brief\\nmention of the sponsors\\nthat made this possible, \\'cause\\nthey did make this possible.\\nAnd we made every effort to\\ntry and keep the ticket prices\\nmanageable for people.\\nAnd thanks to InsideTracker and Momentous\\nfor making this possible.\\nAnd then, of course I\\nwould be completely remiss\\nif I didn\\'t say thank you\\nfor your interest in science.\\n[audience applauding]\\n[audience cheering]\\nThank you.\\nThank you.\\nOh, wow, thank you.\\nThank you.\\nThank you.\\nThank you.\\n[light music]\\nThanks so much.\\nEveryone be sure to get\\nhome safely tonight.'"
