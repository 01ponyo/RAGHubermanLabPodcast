            "('73__transcript.txt', '- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\\nwhere we discuss science\\nand science based tools\\nfor everyday life.\\n[Upbeat music]\\nI\\'m Andrew Huberman,\\nand I\\'m a Professor of\\nNeurobiology and Ophthalmology\\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\\nToday, we are going to\\ntalk about the biology,\\npsychology and utility of play.\\nPlay is something that\\nnormally we associate\\nwith children\\'s games\\nand indeed with being a child,\\nmuch of our childhood\\ndevelopment centers around play,\\nwhether or not it\\'s organized play\\nor spontaneous play,\\nbut as adults, we also need to play.\\nAnd today I\\'m going to talk about\\nwhat I like to refer to\\nas The Power of Play.\\nThe Power of Play,\\nresides in plays ability\\nto change our nervous system\\nfor the better,\\nso that we can perform many activities,\\nnot just play activities, better.\\nPlay can also function\\nas a way to explore new ways of being\\nin different scenarios in work,\\nin relationships, in settings of all kind,\\nand indeed also in the\\nrelationship to oneself.\\nIn fact,\\nwe are going to explore how\\nassuming different identities\\nduring the same game of play\\nor the same forms of play\\nhas been shown to be immensely powerful\\nfor allowing people\\nto engage in more creative thinking\\nand dynamic thinking and\\nindeed to better leaders\\nand more effective workers\\nand students and learners\\nand happier people.\\nI\\'m also going to cover\\nsome data that shows\\nthat learning to play properly\\ncan enhance one\\'s ability to focus\\nand is an active area of research\\nfor treatment of things like ADHD,\\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,\\njust as a little sneak preview\\nof where that\\'s headed,\\nchildren who do not access enough play\\nduring certain stages of childhood\\nare more prone to develop ADHD.\\nThe good news,\\nis all of us regardless of\\nwhether or not we have ADHD\\nor not,\\nwhether or not we had ample access to play\\nduring childhood or not,\\ncan engage and grow the neural circuits\\nthat allow for this\\nincredible power of play.\\nAnd this can be done again\\nat any stage of life today.\\nWe\\'re going to talk about the protocols,\\nthe science, we will review all of that.\\nAnd I promise you\\'ll come away\\nwith a lot of knowledge,\\nwhether or not you\\'re a parent,\\nwhether or not you\\'re a child,\\nwhether or not you\\'re a person of any age,\\nyou\\'re going to have tools\\nand knowledge that will benefit you.\\nBefore we begin,\\nI want to share with you\\nthe results of what I think\\nto be an extremely exciting\\nand certainly an actionable study\\nthat was just published in the\\njournal Scientific Reports.\\nThis is an excellent journal\\nNature Press journal,\\nPeer Reviewed, et cetera,\\nand the finding center around\\nwhat sorts of devices we\\nhappen to be reading on\\nand accessing information on\\nand how that\\'s impacting our physiology\\nand our capacity to learn.\\nOne of the more frequent questions I get\\nis what are all these\\ndevices, phones, tablets,\\ncomputers, video games et cetera,\\ndoing to our brains.\\nAnd finally,\\nthere\\'s some good Peer reviewed data\\nto look at that and to\\naddress it directly.\\nThis study, first author Honma\\nH O N M A\\nHonma et al,\\nis entitled\\n\"Reading on a smartphone\\naffects sigh generation.\\nThat\\'s SIGH sigh generation\\nbrain activity and comprehension.\"\\nAnd to just summarize what they found,\\nthey ran a study on 34 healthy individuals\\nand had them either read\\nmaterial on a smartphone\\nor on regular printed paper or a book.\\nAnd what they found is that\\ncomprehension on devices\\nin particular smartphones\\nis much poorer much worse than it is\\nwhen one reads on actual paper.\\nNow some of you may\\nexperience this yourselves.\\nNow they compared smartphones with paper.\\nAnd what they found was\\nthat when they looked\\nat people\\'s breathing,\\nthe normal patterns of breathing\\nthat people were engaging in\\ndid not differ between people\\nreading on a smartphone\\nor reading from paper.\\nHowever, one particular feature\\nof breathing did differ.\\nAnd that particular\\nfeature is what we call\\nphysiological sighs.\\nI\\'ve talked a lot about\\nphysiological sighs on this podcast,\\nand on social media,\\nwe had a terrific guest,\\nProfessor, Jack Feldman from\\nUniversity of California Los Angeles.\\nWho\\'s a world expert in\\nbreathing and respiration\\nand its impacts on the brain\\nand how brain controls\\nbreathing and respiration\\nand what you can learn from that episode.\\nOr I\\'ll just tell you again right now,\\nis that every five minutes or so,\\nwhether or not we are asleep or awake,\\nwe do what\\'s called a physiological sigh,\\nwhich is a big, deep inhale,\\noften a double inhale\\nfollowed by a long exhale.\\nIt goes something like this.\\n[Inhaling]\\n[Sighs]\\nNow you might think, oh,\\nI never breathe like that,\\nbut you do,\\nunless there\\'s something severely\\nwrong with your brain stem\\nevery five minutes or so\\nyou do one of these physiological sighs,\\nwhich reopens all the little\\nhundreds of millions of sacks\\nin your lungs called alveoli\\nthat bring in more oxygen\\nas a consequence of that\\nbig deep, double inhale.\\nAnd then you are able to\\nexhale carbon dioxide,\\noffload carbon dioxide\\nthrough that long exhale.\\nI\\'ve also encouraged people\\nto use the physiological sigh\\ndeliberately,\\nnot just spontaneously\\nas a way to reduce their stress quickly.\\nAnd indeed my lab works\\non physiological sighs\\nand it\\'s been exploring this\\nand they\\'re quite effective in reducing\\nour stress very fast.\\nReading on our smartphone,\\nseems to suppress physiological sigh.\\nPeople aren\\'t aware that it\\'s happening,\\nbut it\\'s happening.\\nSome people have talked\\nabout so-called email apnea,\\nwhich is the fact that\\npeople hold their breath\\nwhile they email or while they text.\\nAnd indeed many people do that.\\nThis is distinct from\\nemail or texting apnea.\\nWhat\\'s happening here is\\npeople are reading on the phone\\nand for whatever reason,\\nand I\\'ll talk about what\\nthe likely reason is,\\nbut for whatever reason,\\nthey\\'re suppressing their sighing\\nAnd as a consequence,\\nthe brain is not getting enough oxygen\\nand is not offloading\\nenough carbon dioxide.\\nAnd another finding in this study,\\nwas that the prefrontal cortex,\\nan area of the brain that\\'s\\ninvolved in focus and attention\\nand learning\\nbecomes hyperactive in a kind\\nof desperate attempt to focus.\\nAll of this can be summarized by saying,\\nif you happen to read on a device,\\nwhether or not it\\'s a tablet,\\na standard computer screen of any kind,\\nbut in particular on a smart phone,\\nregardless of how small or\\nlarge that smartphone screen is,\\nyou want to remind yourself\\nto engage in these physiological\\nsighs fairly regularly.\\nAnd it might even be better to just\\nread the most or at least the key issues\\nand things that you\\'re trying to learn\\nabout the key information from paper,\\neither books or printed out material\\nof some other sort.\\nWhat\\'s the underlying mechanism here?\\nWell,\\none of the reasons I\\nlike this study so much,\\nis that it brings together\\ntwo of my laboratories\\nand my particular\\ninterests in neuroscience,\\nwhich is how does our visual system\\nand the aperture meaning the\\nsize of our visual window\\nrelate to our so-called autonomic function\\nor our internal state.\\nAnd basically what\\'s happening here is\\nas any of us bring our visual\\nwindow in more narrowly\\nas we contract our visual window,\\nwhich is exactly what happens\\nwhen we\\'re looking at a little\\nsmartphone in front of us.\\nIt seems to suppress\\nthe breathing apparatus\\nbecause we know that physiological sighs\\nare controlled by a\\nspecific set of neurons\\nin the brain stem called\\nthe parafacial nucleus\\ndiscovered by Dr. Jack Feldman.\\nAnd so there must be a mechanism whereby\\nwhen we tighten our visual window,\\nwe somehow, and we don\\'t\\nknow yet how this happens,\\nbut somehow suppress the\\nactivity of these neurons\\nin the parafacial nucleus\\nthat generate this physiological sighs.\\nSo again,\\nyou have two choices or I\\nsuppose you have many choices,\\nbut two main choices\\nto contend with this new information.\\nOne is that you remind yourself\\nto engage in deep breathing\\nand in particular, physiological sighs\\nevery five minutes or so,\\nwhile reading anything or\\ntexting on your smartphone,\\nthe other would be,\\nagain, if there\\'s material\\nthat you really need to learn\\nfor sake of regurgitation later,\\nor for something particularly important,\\ntry and read that from\\neither a larger screen\\nor even better would be from\\nprinted materials or books.\\nAnother reason I bring all that up\\nis that it relates to a larger theme,\\nwhich is that I get many,\\nmany questions about ADHD\\nand about people\\'s challenges with focus\\nand much of what we\\'re\\ntold these days is that\\nwe are challenged with focus\\nbecause of the hundreds of videos\\nthat we can see streaming by\\nus in any moment on our phone,\\nwhich probably is true.\\nThe fact that the information\\nthat we\\'re reading\\non the internet and on our phones\\nis emotionally disturbing\\nor distressing in some way.\\nAnd that probably is true\\nas well in many cases.\\nThis study really points to\\nthe fact that independent\\nof the information that we are looking at\\nor consuming\\nindependent whether or\\nnot it\\'s movies or texts\\nor anything of that sort,\\nthe mere size of the window, the aperture,\\nthe screen that we are looking at\\nis also strongly impacting\\nour ability to learn\\nand remember information.\\nSo broaden that visual window\\nprint things out,\\nlook at a book.\\nI didn\\'t design the system.\\nI always say, you know,\\nhowever our visual system\\nand respiratory system\\nhappened to evolve.\\nI wasn\\'t consulted at the design phase.\\nThis is just simply how\\nyour brain circuits work.\\nSo if you want to learn things,\\nwiden that visual window and\\neven better print things out,\\npick up a book or read on a tablet even,\\nbut try and make that tablet larger\\nthan a smartphone screen size.\\nBefore we begin our discussion\\nabout The Power of Play,\\nI\\'d like to emphasize that this podcast\\nis separate from my teaching\\nand research roles at Stanford.\\nIt is however,\\npart of my desire and effort\\nto bring zero cost to consumer\\ninformation about science\\nand science related tools\\nto the general public\\nin keeping with that theme,\\nI\\'d like to thank the\\nsponsors of today\\'s podcast.\\nOur first sponsor is Athletic\\nGreens also now called AG1.\\nI started drinking Athletic\\nGreens way back in 2012.\\nAnd so I\\'m delighted that\\nthey\\'re sponsoring the podcast.\\nAthletic Greens is an all in one\\nvitamin mineral probiotic drink.\\nThe reason I started drinking it in 2012,\\nand the reason that I still\\ndrink it once or twice a day,\\nis that with Athletic Greens,\\nI cover all of my basic\\nfoundational vitamin mineral\\nprobiotic needs.\\nIt\\'s filled with adaptogens for recovery.\\nThe probiotics are particularly important\\nbecause they encourage health\\nof the so-called gut microbiome.\\nWe\\'re going to be talking a\\nlot about the gut microbiome\\non this podcast in the\\nweeks and months to come,\\nbut to make a long story short,\\nwe have a lot of bacteria\\nliving in our gut\\nthat are healthy bacteria\\nthat support them like\\ndigestion immune system,\\nmetabolic function, hormone systems.\\nAnd perhaps most interestingly to me,\\nthe gut microbiome\\nsupports brain function,\\nincluding mood cognition and so forth.\\nThe probiotics in Athletic Greens\\nstrongly support the gut microbiome\\nand thereby the other systems of the body,\\nincluding the gut brain access,\\nwhich I just referred to.\\nIf you like to try Athletic Greens again,\\nalso called AG1,\\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\\nto claim a special offer.\\nThey\\'re giving away five free travel packs\\nand a year supply of vitamin D3, K2,\\nvitamin D3 is extremely important\\nfor many biological functions.\\nWe are told that we can get\\nenough D3 from sun exposure,\\nbut many of us we\\'re getting sun exposure.\\nAnd many of us who are not\\ngetting enough sun exposure\\nstill don\\'t have ample\\nlevels of vitamin D3\\nSo supplementing with\\nvitamin D3 is necessary\\nfor many many people.\\nAnd K2 is important for\\ncardiovascular function\\nfor proper calcium balance, et cetera.\\nSo again, if you go to\\nathleticgreens.com/huberman,\\nyou can get the five free travel packs\\na year supply of vitamin the D3 K2,\\nand of course your Athletic Greens.\\nToday\\'s episode is also\\nbrought to us by ROKA.\\nROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses\\nthat are of the absolute highest quality.\\nI\\'ve spent a lifetime\\nworking on the visual system.\\nAnd one of the many challenges\\nthat your visual system\\nhas to deal with\\nis for instance, when you\\nmove from a bright environment\\nto a dimer environment, you have to adapt.\\nYou have have to be able\\nto see things clearly,\\nmany sunglasses and eyeglasses\\ndon\\'t allow that adaptation\\nto occur seamlessly,\\nROKA sunglasses and eyeglasses\\nallow that to occur in\\nconcert with your biology\\nand in a way that makes it very seamless.\\nYou just don\\'t notice\\nthe transition at all,\\nwhich is wonderful.\\nI love it \\'cause I don\\'t have\\nto constantly be taking off\\nand putting on my\\nsunglasses when I\\'m outside.\\nI happen to wear readers at\\nnight, eye glass readers.\\nIt\\'s also terrific as the luminance\\nin your environment changes.\\nSo they work under low luminance,\\nhigh luminance, et cetera.\\nThey\\'re very lightweight.\\nIn fact, you can wear them\\nwhen running, when cycling,\\nthey were designed by\\ntwo All-American swimmers\\nfrom Stanford.\\nAnd so originally they were designed\\nfor the purpose of being\\nworn during exercise,\\nbut you can wear them anywhere.\\nThey have a great aesthetic,\\nso you can wear them to

second to none.\\nI started sleeping on a Helix\\nmattress about a year ago now,\\nand it\\'s the best sleep\\nthat I\\'ve ever had.\\nWhat\\'s unique about Helix mattresses\\nis that they tailor their\\nmattresses to your sleep needs.\\nSo if you go to their website,\\nyou can take a brief two minute quiz\\nthat asks questions like,\\ndo you sleep on your stomach\\nor your back or on your\\nside, maybe you don\\'t know,\\ndo you tend to run hot or\\ncold throughout the night?\\nOr maybe you don\\'t know,\\nand it matches you to the mattress.\\nthat\\'s perfect for your sleep needs.\\nI matched to the so-called Dusk mattress,\\nD U S K,\\nbecause I wanted a mattress\\nthat wasn\\'t too firm\\nand not too soft.\\nAnd so I sleep on a Dusk mattress.\\nYou should figure out what\\nmattress would be ideal for you.\\nIf you\\'re interested in\\nupgrading your mattress,\\nyou can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,\\ntake their two minute sleep quiz\\nand the match you to\\na customized mattress.\\nAnd you\\'ll get up to $200 off\\nany of your mattress orders\\nand two free pillows.\\nAgain, that\\'s $200 off\\nand two free pillows.\\nThe pillows are excellent.\\nI also use Helix pillows.\\nThey have a 10 year warranty.\\nYou get to try out the mattress\\nfor up to a hundred nights, risk free.\\nIf you don\\'t like it,\\nthey\\'ll come pick it up,\\ntake it away.\\nBut I think you\\'ll love it.\\nAgain if interested,\\nyou can go to helixsleep.com/huberman.\\nThere can get up to $200 off\\nand the two free pillows.\\nLet\\'s talk about play.\\nNow in researching this episode,\\nI thought that I was going to\\ncome across a bunch of papers\\nthat say this brain area\\nconnects to that brain area,\\nwhich controls play in animals.\\nAnd there\\'s similar areas\\nin babies and in adults.\\nAnd indeed, that\\'s true.\\nAnd we will talk about brain circuitry,\\nbut I think more\\nimportantly is to understand\\nwhat is the utility of play?\\nYou know, why do we\\nplay when we\\'re younger?\\nWhy do we tend to play\\nless as we get older?\\nAnd what in the world is play for?\\nSome of us would be\\ncategorized as more playful.\\nI\\'m sure that you know, people like this,\\nmaybe you are like this\\npeople that can walk into a room,\\na social setting of any kind,\\nand they seem to already\\nkind of have a playful,\\nmaybe even a mischievous\\nquality about them.\\nWe\\'ll talk about mischief\\na little bit later,\\nbut they sort of look at an environment\\nor a social setting as an opportunity\\nfor different kinds of novel interactions.\\nOther people and I\\'d probably\\nput myself into this category.\\nIf I walk into a novel environment,\\nI tend to be more in the\\nmode of just assessing\\nwhat that environment is like.\\nI\\'m not a particularly\\nspontaneously playful person,\\nalthough around certain individuals,\\nI might be more spontaneously playful.\\nWe are all on a continuum\\nof this kind of seriousness\\nto playful nature.\\nTurns out that all young animals,\\nincluding humans\\nhave more playfulness and tend to engage\\nin more spontaneous play\\nin their earlier years\\nthan in their later years.\\nAnd therein lies a very interesting portal\\nto understanding what the utility,\\nwhat the purpose of play is.\\nFirst of all,\\nI want to lay down a couple\\nof key facts about play\\nthat point to the fact that\\nplay is not just about games.\\nPlay is about much, much more\\nand play and in particular,\\nhow we played as a child\\nand still how we can play as adults\\nis really how we test\\nand expand our potential roles\\nin all kinds of interactions.\\nOne of the most important,\\ninteresting and surprising\\nfeatures of play\\nthat I\\'d like everyone to know about\\nis that it is homeostatically regulated.\\nSome of you are familiar\\nwith the term homeostasis.\\nHomeostasis is just this\\naspect of biological systems\\nto try and remain in balance.\\nYou know, if you stay awake\\nfor a long period of time,\\nyou tend to want to sleep\\nfor a long period of time.\\nIf you slept for a long period of time\\nand you\\'re very rested,\\nthen you tend to be very\\nenergetic the next day.\\nAnd of course, I know people\\nout there will immediately say,\\noh, well, if I sleep too long,\\nthen I\\'m groggy the next day.\\nOf course there are exceptions,\\nbut in general,\\nsleep and wakefulness are\\nin homeostatic balance.\\nThirst and water consumption\\nare in homeostatic balance.\\nIf you don\\'t drink any fluids for a while,\\nyou tend to get more thirsty,\\nyou drink fluids\\nand your thirst tends to diminish\\nlikewise with food.\\nLikewise, with most all\\nmotivated behaviors.\\nWell,\\none of the most important discoveries\\nof the last century,\\nwas largely the work of a\\nguy named Jaak Panksepp.\\nNo, it\\'s not Jack it\\'s Jaak Panksepp\\nwho really pioneered this understanding\\nof the biology of play\\nand relating that to\\nthe psychology of play\\nin animals and humans.\\nHe\\'s considered kind of\\nluminary in the field of play,\\nand what a great title to have, right?\\nIf you could have a title\\nand be a scientific luminary,\\nyou might as well be the, the play guy.\\nIn fact he was known and I\\'ll\\nget into this later as to why,\\nbut he was known as the \"Rat Tickler\"\\nbecause he tickled rats.\\nAnd he actually found that\\nrodents and animals of many kind\\ngenerate laughter in response to tickling.\\nAnd in fact,\\nthey don\\'t have the capacity\\nto tickle themselves\\nsomething we\\'ll also\\ntalk about why that is.\\nAnd he was called the \"Rat tickler,\"\\nbut then he discovered that\\nmany species of animals\\nengage in laughter in response to tickling\\nand they tickle each other.\\nAnd the reason you don\\'t\\nhear them laughing,\\nno you can\\'t hear your dog laughing\\nthat isn\\'t laughing it\\'s something else\\nis that most animals besides humans laugh\\nat kind of ultrasonic\\nlevels of auditory output.\\nMeaning the frequencies\\nof sound are just too high\\nfor you to hear,\\nbut with the appropriate devices,\\nhe was able with his colleagues\\nto isolate this so-called\\nthe \"Rat Laughter\"\\nand then turns out there\\'s kitten laughter\\nand there\\'s puppy laughter.\\nAnd of course there\\'s human laughter.\\nSo Jaak Panksepp was a very interesting\\nand pioneering person in this field.\\nAnd he also discovered that play\\nis homeostatically regulated.\\nMeaning if animals including children\\nare restricted from playing\\nfor a certain amount of time,\\nthey will play more when\\ngiven the opportunity\\nin the same way that\\nif I food restrict you\\nfor a long period of time,\\nyou\\'ll eat more when you\\nare finally allowed to eat.\\nNow this is important\\nbecause it moves this thing that we call\\nplay from the dimension\\nof higher order functions\\nor things evolved recently,\\nyou know, that are really\\nkind of at the front edge\\nof human evolution,\\ndeeper into the circuitry of the brain,\\nwhereby we say the brain stem,\\nthe kind of ancient parts of the brain\\nare going to be involved.\\nAnd in fact, that\\'s the case\\nas we\\'re going to learn\\nlater in the podcast,\\nplay is generated through the connectivity\\nof many brain areas.\\nBut one of the key brain areas\\nis an area called PAG Periaqueductal Gray.\\nThe Periaqueductal Gray\\nis a brain stem area.\\nSo it\\'s pretty far back\\nas the brain kind of transitions\\ninto the spinal cord.\\nAnd it\\'s rich with neurons\\nthat make endogenous opioids.\\nSo these are not the kinds of opioids\\nthat are causing the opioid crisis.\\nThese are neurons that you and I all have\\nthat release endogenous, meaning self-made\\nor biologically made opioids.\\nThey go by names like enkephalin\\nand things of that sort.\\nPlay evokes small amounts of\\nopioid release into the system.\\nThey kind of dope you up a little bit,\\nnot so much as one would see if\\none were to take exogenous opioids.\\nAnd in fact exogenous\\nopioids as we now know,\\nare potentially very hazardous,\\nhighly high addiction potential\\nhigh overdose potential.\\nThey cause all sorts of problems.\\nYes there are clinical uses for them,\\nbut they\\'re causing a\\nlot of problems nowadays,\\nbut these endogenous opioids\\nare released in children and adults\\nanytime we engage in play.\\nAnd that turns out to be a\\nvery important chemical state\\nbecause there\\'s something about\\nhaving an abundance of\\nthese endogenous opioids\\nreleased into the brain\\nthat allows other areas of the brain,\\nlike the prefrontal cortex,\\nthe area of the front that\\'s responsible\\nfor what we call executive function.\\nExecutive function is the\\nability to make predictions,\\nto assess contingencies.\\nLike if I do this,\\nthen that happens.\\nIf I do that, then that happens.\\nWell prefrontal cortex is often seen\\nas a kind of rigid executive\\nof the whole brain.\\nThat\\'s one way to view it,\\nbut probably a better way to view it\\nis that the prefrontal cortex works\\nin concert with these other\\nare more primitive circuitries.\\nAnd when the periaqueductal gray releases\\nthese endogenous opioids during play,\\nthe prefrontal cortex, doesn\\'t get stupid.\\nIt actually gets smarter.\\nIt develops the ability\\nto take on different roles\\nand explore different contingencies.\\nAnd we\\'re going to talk about role play\\nlater in different contexts.\\nAnd what we will find\\nis that so much of play\\nis really about exploring things in a way\\nthat feels safe enough to explore, right?\\nThis is not what happens\\nwhen we drive down the street\\nor when we bike down the street,\\nwhen we are headed to work,\\ncommuting on our bicycle\\nor walking or driving,\\nwe tend to be very linear\\nand we tend to be very goal directed.\\nWe\\'re not going to just take\\na new street just because\\nwe\\'re not going to be\\nspontaneously riding in the middle\\nof the road\\nand then on the sidewalk\\nand then back and forth.\\nAlthough I can remember as a kid,\\nI was doing some of that.\\nI like to jump off curb\\ncuts when I was a kid.\\nAnd then eventually I\\ngraduated, sorry to the cyclist,\\nbut I graduated to skateboarding.\\nAnd then I look on skateboarding.\\nYou\\'re always kind of exploring terrain,\\nbut you know, as I got older,\\nactually I find myself\\nbecoming much more linear.\\nI just don\\'t play with\\nmy commute very much.\\nIt\\'s really just about getting\\nto work and then working.\\nWhen endogenous opioids are in our system,\\nwhen we\\'re in this mode of play,\\nthe prefrontal cortex starts seeing\\nand exploring many more\\npossibilities of how we interact\\nwith our environment,\\nwith others and the roles that\\nwe can assume for ourselves.\\nAnd so we\\'re going to dissect one by one,\\nthe different aspects of play,\\nrole play, social play,\\nindividual play, imaginary\\nplay, competitive play\\nthey are enormous number\\nof dimensions of play.\\nAnd by the end of this episode,\\nwe are going to arrive\\nat a very key feature.\\nThe key feature is one that\\'s called\\nyour personal play identity.\\nAll of us have what we call\\na personal play identity.\\nThis personal play identity\\nwas laid down during development.\\nAnd it is the identity that you\\nassume in playful scenarios.\\nAnd it is identity that you\\nadopt in non playful scenarios.\\nNow the great news is that\\nyour personal play identity\\nis plastic throughout\\nyour entire lifespan.\\nYou can adjust your personal play identity\\nin ways that will benefit\\nyou in work in relationships\\nand your overall level of happiness.\\nWe will discuss protocols\\nand ways to do that.\\nBut I do want to give\\na nod to the late jack,\\nJaak excuse me,\\nJaak Panksepp, \"The rat tickler.\"\\nAnd I also want to just give\\na nod to play generally,\\nas we move forward in the discussion.\\nWhat I\\'d love for everyone to do\\nis to stop thinking about\\nplay as just a child activity,\\nnot just a sport related activity,\\nbut really as an exploration\\nin contingencies.\\nAgain, it\\'s an exploration of,\\nif I do A, what happens?\\nIf I do B, what happens?\\nIf someone else takes on\\nbehavior or attitude C\\nwhat am I going to do?\\nAnd play is really where\\nwe can expand our catalog\\nof potential outcomes,\\nand it can be enormously enriching.\\nAnd indeed as we\\'ll talk about\\nthe tinkerers of the world,\\nthe true creatives,\\nthe people that building\\nincredible technologies and art,\\nand also that just have incredibly rich,\\nemotional and intellectual\\nand social lives\\nall have a strong element of play.\\nAnd so today I hope to convince you\\nof some protocols that\\nwill allow you to expand\\nyour various roles in life,\\nthrough the portal of play.\\nSo we establish that play is homeostatic,\\nmeaning we all need to do it.\\nMany of us, including myself,\\nhaven\\'t played that much as adults.\\nWe\\'re all pretty busy.\\nNumber of us are stressed.\\nWe got a lot to do in life,\\nbut as children,\\nmost all of us engage in a lot of play.\\nAnd in looking at the way\\nthat very young children\\nand especially toddlers play,\\nwe can learn a lot\\nbecause it reveals the fundamental rules\\nby which the toddler brain\\ninteracts with the world.\\nNow,\\none of the key things\\nabout the baby brain\\nis that the baby brain somehow\\nknows that it can\\'t do\\neverything in the world, right?\\nIf a baby needs something,\\nit generally will cry or make\\nsome sort of vocalization\\nor some sort of facial expression\\nor combination of those.\\nAnd the caretaker, whoever\\nthat may be will provide it.\\nThis is an ancient hard wired mechanism\\nwhereby the so-called\\nautonomic nervous system\\nthat generates stress\\nwill create this kind of\\nwhining and discomfort,\\nmaybe arriving,\\nmaybe the baby gets\\nkind of red in the face\\nand the caretaker delivers some thing\\nbased on a good guess\\nof what that baby needs.\\nSo maybe it\\'s breast milk,\\nmaybe it\\'s bottle milk.\\nMaybe it\\'s a diaper change.\\nMaybe it\\'s to be warmed\\nup if the baby is cold,\\nmaybe it\\'s to be cooled\\ndown if the baby\\'s too warm,\\nmaybe if the baby\\'s in\\nits a little onesie thing,\\nit\\'s feeling restricted\\nand it just wants to move\\nand they\\'ll get taken out of their,\\ntheir crib or their stroller,\\nwhatever it is and allowed\\nto stretch out on the floor.\\nRemember the baby doesn\\'t\\nknow exactly what it needs.\\nIt only knows the state of discomfort.\\nAnd of course we don\\'t know\\nexactly what babies and toddlers\\nare thinking\\nbecause they can\\'t express\\nthemselves with language yet.\\nBut what\\'s key to understand\\nis the rule or the\\ncontingency that is set up\\nin that scenario.\\nIn that scenario,\\nthe child feels some discomfort\\nexpresses that discomfort verbally\\nor through a facial expression or both\\nand then some force some\\nperson from the outside world\\nresolves it.\\nAnd so the very young baby\\nand indeed many children\\nup to certain ages\\nand let\\'s confess many adults\\nare not able to meet or\\nadjust their internal states\\nof stress.\\nAnd so they look to\\nthings outside of them.\\nThat\\'s the first rule,\\nthe fundamental rule\\nthat we all learn when we come into life,\\nthat when in a state of discomfort\\nto look outside our immediate biology,\\nbeyond the confines of our\\nskin and find a solution,\\na sip of water for adults,\\nit might be sip of alcohol,\\nright?\\nProbably not the best\\ntool to relieve stress,\\nbut that\\'s one that many people do.\\nIn fact engaging for\\nthe baby that\\'s hungry.\\nThe bottle milk comes from the outside.\\nAs we gain more proficiency\\nin moving through life\\nand we can get things for ourselves.\\nWe still often bring things\\nfrom the external world in\\nto resolve this what I\\'m calling\\nautonomic discomfort or\\nautonomic dysregulation.\\nThat\\'s not a game, but that\\'s a rule.\\nAs we advance from infant to toddler,\\nwe start to think more\\nin terms of where we are\\nand what we own relative to\\nwhat\\'s out there in the world.\\nAnd now in the world of child psychology,\\nthere\\'s a somewhat famous poem\\nthat was written by a\\nresearch child psychologist.\\nHis name was Burton White,\\nand he wrote a poem called\\n\"The Toddlers Creed\"\\n\"The Toddlers Creed\" defines well,\\nwhat the rules and\\ncontingencies of play are\\nin very young children.\\nAnd it reveals to us just how narrow\\nand limited their world view is\\nand how self entered their world is.\\nSo \"The Toddlers Creed\" read quickly,\\ncuz\\' I don\\'t want to take up\\ntoo much time with this is.\\n\"If I want it.\\nIt\\'s mine.\\nIf I give it to you and\\nchange my mind later,\\nit\\'s mine.\"\\nFor anyone that\\'s played with a toddler,\\nyou can imagine this in your mind.\\n\"If I can take it away\\nfrom you, it\\'s mine.\\nIf I had a little while ago, it\\'s mine.\\nIf we are building something together,\\nall the pieces are mine.\\nIf it looks just like mine,\\nit\\'s mine.\\nIf it\\'s mine, it will never\\nbelong to anyone else,\\nno matter what.\"\\nAnd of course, as we hear this\\nsounds quite awful, right?\\nAnd yet this is actually\\na reflection of what\\na healthy toddler would\\nthink about the world.\\nThat the objects and things,\\nand even the people in\\nthe world are theirs,\\nthat they are actually\\npossessions that belong to them.\\nNow of course,\\nsome people never actually\\ntransition beyond this stage\\nof moral and social development.\\nAnd there are indeed some adults\\nthat fit \"The Toddlers Creed.\"\\nAnd you\\'re welcome to\\nshare this with them.\\nIf ever you think that\\nit might be of benefit\\nto their self-reflection.\\nBut in all seriousness Burton White\\'s\\n\"Toddlers Creed\" is really grounded\\nin this transition from\\nwhen we are infants.\\nAnd we have to have\\nthings delivered to us,\\nto the point where we are toddlers\\nand we can access things in the world,\\nbut we tend to assume\\nthat they are all ours.\\nAnd then the next stage\\nis the really key stage\\nas it relates to play\\nbecause is in the next\\nstage of development\\nis where young children start\\nto interact with other children\\nand there\\'s an exchange and a possession\\nand then a letting go of certain things,\\nlearning that not everything is yours\\nand that the entire world is not about you\\nis one of the key contingencies\\nthat is established during play.\\nIt\\'s one of the key way\\nin which children go\\nfrom being very self-centered\\nand basically unable to\\nengage with other kids\\nfor very long,\\nwithout some sort of eruption of crying\\nand some sort of battle of, you know,\\nkind of push pull over an object\\nto things like sharing and\\nthings like cooperative play.\\nSo as we transition from forms of play\\nthat are all about the self\\nthat are all me, me, me, me,\\n\"The Toddlers Creed\"\\nto forms of play that involve\\nsome discomfort in assuming roles\\nthat maybe we don\\'t want and\\nnot getting what we want.\\nIt\\'s really an opportunity for the brain\\nto start to explore different\\nroles that people take,\\nhow they work as individuals\\nand as pairs and in larger groups.\\nAnd to do that in a low\\nstakes environment, right?\\nYou wouldn\\'t want this to be worked out\\non the battlefield or\\nwhen searching for food\\nor in some high stakes environment\\nwhere the survival of the\\nspecies was important.\\nIt appears that these\\ncircuitry for play evolved.\\nSo that rules and contingencies\\naround who\\'s most important,\\nwhether or not the group is important,\\nwhether or not individuals\\nare going to be leaders\\nor followers, et cetera,\\nthat can be explored in\\na low stakes environment.\\nNow there are hundreds of\\ndifferent types of play\\nand hundreds of different\\ntypes of contingency testing.\\nBut the key theme here is that\\nplay allows children and\\nadults for that matter\\nto explore different outcomes\\nin a kind of low stakes environment.\\nIf you\\'re playing a board\\ngame or a card game,\\nyou might get really into that game,\\nbut unless there\\'s a lot of\\nmoney on the table, so to speak,\\nor you\\'re really playing\\nfor something important\\nor unless your ego is swollen\\nway out of proportion,\\nto reality,\\nif you lose, you might\\nnot feel good about it,\\nbut it\\'s truly not the end of the world.\\nAnd if you win,\\nyou might feel really good about it,\\nbut you\\'re not really incredible.\\nYou were just incredible in\\nthat particular situation\\nfor that particular moment,\\nit doesn\\'t really transform\\nthe rest of your life,\\nunless that game is of a\\nparticular type for sport\\nfor instance.\\nWe\\'ll talk about sport later.\\nSo the key theme here is that\\nplay is contingency testing.\\nplay is contingency\\ntesting under conditions\\nwhere the stakes are sufficiently low,\\nthat individuals should feel comfortable\\nassuming different roles,\\neven roles that they\\'re\\nnot entirely comfortable\\nwithin their outside life.\\nAnd that all relates again\\nto the release of these\\nendogenous opioids,\\nin this brain center periaqueductal gray\\nand the way that it allows\\nthe prefrontal cortex\\nin a very direct way I mean,\\ntruly it allows it in a biological way\\nto expand the number of\\noperations that it can run,\\nand start thinking about, oh, well, okay.\\nNormally I\\'m kind of a loner\\nand I like to read and work\\nand you know, hang out\\nalone maybe and play alone\\nbut you know okay,\\nI\\'ll play a board game\\nor a game of tennis\\nwhere I have a partner and\\nwe\\'re going to play as partners\\nagainst two other people.\\nOkay, that\\'s a little\\nuncomfortable, but I\\'ll do it.\\nAnd in doing that,\\nyou discover certain ways\\nin which you are\\nproficient in certain ways,\\nin which you are less proficient,\\nyou discover that the other person\\nactually tends to cheat a little bit\\nor the other person is\\nextremely rigid about the rules,\\nor maybe it is extremely rigid\\nabout the way they organize\\ntheir pieces on the board,\\nor they\\'re crossing the line\\ninto your side of the tennis court.\\nThere are all sorts of\\nthings that we learn\\nin these rather low stake scenarios.\\nThat\\'s the key theme here.\\nSo before I continue,\\nI just want to point to a\\ntool that anyone can use,\\nbut in particular, the\\nless playful of the group.\\nAnd I would put myself into this category.\\nAgain, I\\'m not somebody who really engages\\nin spontaneous play.\\nI enjoy sports.\\nI enjoy exercise,\\nbut that is distinct from play\\nbecause the sports and\\nexercise that I engage in,\\nI take pretty seriously.\\nThey\\'re not low stakes for me.\\nI put actually I put a\\nlot of importance on them.\\nWhich is I\\'m saying all this,\\nI probably should put a\\nlittle less importance on them\\nand have a little more fun with those.\\nAnd yet what I\\'m about to tell you is that\\nanyone and everyone can\\nbenefit from engaging\\nin a bit more of this playful mindset,\\nthe playful mindset is not necessarily\\nabout smiling and jumping\\naround or being silly.\\nThat\\'s not it at all.\\nIt\\'s not Tigger character\\nfrom \"Winnie the Pooh\" necessarily.\\nIt could be,\\nbut it\\'s really about allowing yourself\\nto expand the number of outcomes\\nthat you\\'re willing to entertain\\nand to think about how you relate\\nto those different outcomes.\\nSo what this means is putting yourself\\ninto scenarios where\\nyou might not be the top performer, right?\\nPlaying a game that you\\'re\\nnot really that good at.\\nI had this experience recently,\\nfriends that like to play cards,\\nthey like to do some low stake gambling.\\nThis is non illegal gambling ring.\\nThey play for trivial things.\\nAnd I generally don\\'t buy into the game.\\nI generally don\\'t play\\nmostly because they end\\nup winning and taking\\nwhatever it is that I have.\\nBut in the mode of assuming\\na more playful spirit,\\nthe idea would be well,\\nif the stakes are low enough,\\nthen to play simply for\\nthe sake of playing,\\nbecause there\\'s something to learn there\\nabout the other people in the group\\nand about one\\'s self\\nand how one reacts to things like\\nsomeone who\\'s clearly trying\\nto take everybody\\'s money\\nor somebody who is clearly trying to cheat\\nor somebody who\\'s clearly very, very rigid\\nabout every last detail,\\nincluding how the cards are\\ndealt and shuffled right?\\nThere is learning in this exploration.\\nAnd that is at a biological\\nlevel, the prefrontal Cortex,\\nstarting to entertain\\ndifferent possibilities,\\nstarting to entertain different outcomes\\nin this low stakes way.\\nAnd if you think about it,\\nthat\\'s not something\\nthat we allow ourselves\\nto do very often.\\nEven if we listen to new forms of music\\nor we go see new art or new movies,\\nthose are new experiences,\\nbut that\\'s not us making new predictions\\nabout what\\'s going to happen next.\\nIt\\'s not the brain working to figure out\\nnew possibilities.\\nAnd so you can immediately see how\\njust a small increase in your willingness\\nto put yourself into conditions\\nwhere you don\\'t understand\\nall the rules perhaps,\\nor you\\'re not super\\nproficient at something,\\nbut you enter it\\nbecause it is low stakes.\\nAnd because there is information to learn\\nabout yourself and others\\ncould start to open up these\\nprefrontal cortex circuits.\\nAnd when I say open up,\\nI don\\'t mean that literally\\nthere\\'s an opening\\nin your skull.\\nWhat I mean is that your prefrontal cortex\\ncan work in very rigid ways.\\nMeaning if A then B,\\nif I go down this street turn\\nleft and go that way to work,\\nit is fast.\\nIf I go down the other street, it\\'s slow.\\nIf there\\'s a traffic jam there,\\nI\\'m going to go there\\nbut it\\'s starting to explore\\ndifferent possibilities.\\nAnd there are very, very\\nfew opportunities in life\\nto explore contingencies\\nin this low stakes way,\\nsuch that it engages neuroplasticity,\\nthe prefrontal cortex.\\nSo play is powerful\\nat making your prefrontal\\ncortex more plastic,\\nmore able to change in\\nresponse to experience,\\nbut not just during the period of play,\\nbut in all scenarios,\\nbecause you get one prefrontal cortex,\\nyou don\\'t get a prefrontal\\ncortex just for play.\\nYou get a prefrontal cortex\\nthat engages in everything.\\nSo going forward,\\nI will layer on some more\\nconcrete aspects of tools,\\nbut for now,\\nif you\\'re somebody that\\ndoesn\\'t consider yourself,\\nparticularly playful\\nconsider,\\nand maybe even engage in\\njust a little bit of play\\nin some way,\\nthat is of discomfort to you\\nwith the understanding that is increasing\\nyour prefrontal cortical plasticity.\\nAnother really interesting\\nand important aspect of play\\nis so-called play postures.\\nThese are seen in animals,\\nand these are seen in humans.\\nAnd for those of you that\\nare watching this podcast\\non YouTube, I\\'ll do my\\nbest to adopt them here.\\nFor those of you that are listening,\\nyou\\'ll just have to imagine\\nthem in your mind\\'s eye,\\nbut Jaak Panksepp and\\nindeed Darwin himself,\\nstudy these play postures\\nthat all animal engage in.\\nPerhaps the most familiar one\\nis seen in dogs and in wolves\\nwhere they will lower\\ntheir head to the ground\\nand they\\'ll put their\\npaws out in front of them\\nand they will make eye contact\\nwith another typically dog or wolf\\nto so-called call the play.\\nNow, when they do this posture,\\nit\\'s obvious that they\\'re\\nlowering themselves.\\nThey\\'re not in an aggressive stance,\\nbecause they\\'re lowering their head.\\nAnd this is universally known\\namong canines as play posture.\\nThere\\'s some famous videos online.\\nYou can look these up\\nof dogs actually doing this with bears\\nthat they\\'re confronted with\\nand the bears, at least in these videos\\nin exchange also lowering their head,\\nand there you see bear\\ndog playful interactions.\\nNow you always have to be\\ncautious with bears in general.\\nI would say you have to\\nbe cautious with bears,\\nbut this speaks to the\\nuniversality of this bowing,\\nthis sort of the, the,\\nwhat some people call the puppy bow\\nor the play bow that dogs do\\nturns out that humans do this as well.\\nAlthough in a different form,\\nI\\'m sure there are some that go into the,\\nthe down-dog play posture,\\nbut more typically when\\nhumans want to play,\\nthey will do a subtle or\\nnot so subtle head tilt.\\nThe head tilt with eyes open\\nis considered the universal head\\nand facial expression\\nposture of play in humans.\\nSo when two people see one another,\\nif they are aggressive\\ntowards one another,\\nthey will assume certain facial\\nexpressions and postures.\\nBut if they\\'re feeling\\nplayful towards one another,\\noftentimes they\\'ll tip\\ntheir head to the side\\njust a little bit and\\nthey\\'ll open their eyes.\\nThey might even raise\\ntheir eyebrows briefly.\\nThis has been seen again\\nand again and again.\\nAnother hardwired feature\\nof so-called play postures\\nis what\\'s called soft eyes.\\nWhen animals are aggressive,\\nor when they\\'re sad,\\nthey tend to reduce the\\nsize of their eye openings\\nby basically making their\\neyelids closer together,\\nsomewhat,\\nby keeping their eyes together\\nin particular for aggression,\\nthey\\'ll bring their eyes towards\\nwhat we call a vergence eye movement.\\nBring it towards the center\\nthat actually narrows the\\naperture of the visual field.\\nWhen people or animals\\nwant to engage in play,\\nthey tend to open their eyelids somewhat,\\nand they tend to purse their\\nlips just a little bit.\\nSo it\\'s not like stronger\\npursing when your lips like this,\\nit\\'s, pursing their lips.\\nThey\\'ll open their eyes a little bit.\\nAnd they\\'ll often do\\nthe head tilt as well.\\nSometimes with a little bit of a smile.\\nThese are reflexive\\nthese are not trained up.\\nChildren do this.\\nAdults do this dogs, wolves do this.\\nEven certain birds will do this.\\nMost birds have eyes on\\nthe side of their heads,\\nbut they do a sort of form\\nof this soft eyes approach.\\nAnd certainly in raptors,\\nyou see a softening of the eyes\\nand indeed raptors like Hawks and Eagles\\nthey actually do have\\na certain form of play,\\nbut only early in life.\\nThe other thing that we see during play,\\nor what are called partial postures,\\npartial postures are a\\nkind of play enactment\\nof postures that would\\notherwise be threatening.\\nSo a partial posture that we\\nsee during play in animals\\nand humans that relates\\nto aggressive play.\\nSo things like wrestling\\nor things like rough and tumble play,\\nwhich is very common in animals\\nand kids and some adults.\\nIs that because there\\'s going\\nto be physical interaction\\nin animals,\\nwhat will happen is\\nthey will march toward one\\nanother often very slowly,\\nbut rather than having their hair up,\\nwhich is we call piloerection,\\nwhich is when the hair goes up,\\nanimals do this to make\\nthemselves look bigger.\\nThink of about the, the cat.\\nThat\\'s trying to look bigger or an animal\\nthat\\'s being aggressive,\\ntrying to look bigger\\nin the presence of a foe,\\na different animal that\\nthey\\'re either going to try\\nand kill or fight in some way,\\neven if it\\'s to defend themselves,\\npartial postures occur\\nwhen animals will approach\\none another,\\nbut they\\'ll keep their fur down.\\nHumans will do this to,\\nthey will approach during play,\\nbut unless it\\'s highly competitive play\\nlike a football game or a boxing match,\\nthey will actually shrink\\ntheir body size somewhat.\\nWe have hair on our bodies,\\nsome of us more than others,\\nand that hair is capable of piloerection.\\nIt can stand up.\\nThat\\'s the hair standing\\nup on end phenomenon,\\nbut most of us don\\'t have\\nenough hair on our bodies\\nthat we can actually use that\\nto make ourselves larger.\\nSo what you see with people\\nwho are about to engage in play\\nis they tend to make their\\nbody a little bit smaller\\nunless they are highly competitive\\nand highly competitive play\\nis its own distinct form of play.\\nThat we\\'ll talk about later,\\nsuch as during sport,\\nwhen the stakes are high,\\na Super Bowl football game,\\nI\\'m revealing my ignorance\\nabout sports here.\\nThe Super Bowl as it\\'s typically called\\nis a very high stakes game, right?\\nSalaries depend on it.\\nSponsorships depend on it.\\nIt\\'s on television,\\nreputations depend on it.\\nSo that\\'s not really playing a game.\\nThat\\'s playing a very high stakes game\\nand there you\\'re not going to\\nsee these partial postures.\\nYou\\'re not going to see soft\\neyes and tilting of the head.\\nAt least not between the\\nopposing players on the team,\\nyou\\'re going to see quite the opposite.\\nGrunting, screaming, shouldering\\npeople not blinking lowering their eyes,\\nor rather shrinking their eyes down to be,\\nto appear more aggressive.\\nThese kinds of things\\nstaring right through the other person,\\nyou know verbal threats et cetera.\\nSo that\\'s not really play,\\neven though we say they\\'re\\nplaying a game of football,\\nit\\'s very high stakes play.\\nWhat I\\'m referring to here\\nis when it\\'s fairly low stakes.\\nAnd we see this again\\nin animals and human.\\nSo there are many, many\\nof these partial postures.\\nAgain, they happen spontaneously.\\nSo if someone ever looks at you\\nand they tilt their head a little bit\\nand they raise their eyebrows\\nand they maybe smile a little bit,\\nthey\\'re looking at you playfully,\\nthat\\'s the universal human\\nexchange of, I want to play.\\nDo you want to play?\\nThere\\'s another play expression\\nthat is considered the\\nmost extreme of the come on\\nlet\\'s play express and postures.\\nAnd this is one that\\'s\\nseen in a lot of primates\\nand indeed in some humans as well.\\nAnd that\\'s the eyes wide open\\nand believe it or not tongue out,\\nit\\'s the, that kind of silly thing.\\nThat\\'s I don\\'t think that\\nI\\'ve ever done that before.\\nJust that kind of thing\\nis basically what primate\\nspecies of all kinds.\\nAnd indeed we are old\\nworld primates as well,\\ndo when they want to say,\\nI\\'m definitely here to play\\nand that\\'s why I\\'m here.\\nOkay it\\'s it has this kind\\nof silly look or connotation.\\nBut if you watch chimpanzees\\nor you look at Bonobos,\\nor even in the so-called\\nnew world monkeys,\\nwhich tend to be the smaller monkeys,\\nold world monkeys tend to\\nbe the ones that in general,\\nsee the world as we do,\\nthey have what we call trichromacy.\\nThey\\'re the ones that often\\ncan look very human-like.\\nThe new world monkeys\\ntend to be the little ones\\nin general I\\'ll give\\nyou a little trick here.\\nLittle tool based on primatology.\\nIf you see a monkey and it\\'s\\nmaking very slow movements,\\nor you see an ape of any kinds,\\nmaking very slow movements,\\nvery likely to be an old world primate.\\nIf you see a monkey\\nand it\\'s, it can very quick movements\\nlike it\\'s doing this kind of thing,\\nlike it\\'s like a could\\nbe a squirrel monkey\\ncould be a marmoset,\\nlikely to be a new world monkey.\\nAnd they don\\'t see the world\\nthat the same way we do,\\nthey see the world more like a dog.\\nThey don\\'t really see reds.\\nThey see reds as orange et cetera.\\nOkay that\\'s not a hard and fast rule.\\nAnd I\\'m sure the primatologists\\nare going to come after me\\nwith whatever primatologists\\ncome after you\\nwith monkey biscuits\\nor something like that.\\nBut in general, it\\'s a good rule.\\nIf you\\'re at the zoo and\\nyou see a slow moving monkey\\nwith slow deliberate gestures\\nkind of moves its eyes\\nmakes eye contact every once in a while,\\nthose tend to be the old world primates,\\nthose kind of jittery ones\\nthat look like they\\'re really\\nnervous wrapping their tail\\nand kind of hiding there\\nin a little bundle.\\nThose tend to be the\\nnew world monkeys, okay.\\nAgain, not a black and\\nwhite type division,\\nbut that\\'ll get you most of the way.\\nSo the whole purpose of\\nthese partial postures\\nor the tongue out thing\\nis to limit power in deliberate ways\\nto really take bodily expressions\\nthat could be portrayed or could be\\ninterpreted as aggressive\\nor as threatening or as wanting to mate,\\nor as willing wanting to do\\nanything for that matter.\\nAnd to limit the power with\\nwhich they are expressed\\nin very deliberate way.\\nSo that\\'s the putting the hair down,\\ndespite getting into a fighting stance.\\nThat\\'s saying let\\'s fight,\\nbut I\\'m not really here to fight fight.\\nIt\\'s low stakes fighting.\\nLike if I pin you,\\nthen I\\'ll let you go.\\nOr if you pin me, then\\nyou ought let me go.\\nAnd so immediately you can start to see\\nhow play starts to call into action,\\nsocial dynamics in which both parties\\nhave to make some sort of agreement\\nabout how high the stakes are.\\nNow, the failures to do this\\nare also very informative\\nin how we develop in social groups.\\nAnd this also can inform why some people\\nreally play well with others\\nand other people don\\'t.\\nAnd some people seem to\\nget along well with groups\\nand can handle other people.\\nAnd some people are very rigid.\\nIn fact, I have an anecdote\\nabout this when I was a kid,\\nwe used to play this game.\\nIt\\'s not a game I suggest,\\nbut we used to do what were\\ncalled \"Dirt Clod Wars.\"\\nSo a friend of mine,\\nhis parents were generally\\nnot home in the afternoon.\\nSo we must have been somewhere\\naround 10 or 11 years old.\\nAnd we would set up these\\ntwo big dirt mounds.\\nWe would shovel them to big\\ndirt mounds on two sides\\nof the yard.\\nAnd then we would just take dirt clods\\nand we throw them at one\\nanother and just have\\ndirt clod wars.\\nAgain, not suggesting this\\nI\\'m not responsible for what happens\\nif you do,\\nbut there were rules\\nand the rules were, for instance,\\nyou couldn\\'t pack rocks\\ninto the dirt clods\\nand you could run across to the other side\\nand you could jump on\\nthe other person\\'s mound\\nand you could throw dirt clods in there.\\nI guess, as the stuff that\\nwe thought was entertaining.\\nBut if someone got hit in the head,\\ngenerally there was an unspoken rule\\nthat you kind of stop\\nand see whether or not they were damaged\\nor not before you\\'d continue,\\nyou couldn\\'t continue pelting them.\\nAnd of course, people broke this rule.\\nIn fact I remember one kid\\nI\\'m not going to name him\\nbecause actually he\\'s grown\\ninto a very actually prominent\\nand functional adult,\\nbut he got hit once in the head.\\nAnd then I think someone\\nhad thrown a dirt clod\\nshortly thereafter,\\nand all of a sudden he\\njust went into a rage,\\npicking up rocks and sticks\\nand attacking another kid.\\nAnd so clearly that was a case in which\\nthe rules of the game\\nwere now being violated,\\nbut it served a very important purpose.\\nThere was, you know,\\nthe typical thing that the,\\nthere were some tears I think,\\nas I recall from one kid or the other,\\nthere was like snot coming out of the nose\\nand turning bright red, a kid went home.\\nIt was a mess.\\nThe parents had to say something,\\nor maybe there was a phone call.\\nI don\\'t quite recall how it got resolved.\\nBut the idea is that\\nthere\\'s an agreed upon set of rules\\nabout how high the stakes are\\nand what we\\'re all going to do.\\nAnd this is separate from sport\\nwhere there are clearly defined rules\\nabout what\\'s out of bounds.\\nWhat\\'s in-bounds.\\nWhat sorts of behaviors\\nwill get you a yellow card\\nor a red card for instance\\non the soccer field,\\nall animals including humans\\nare doing this low stakes\\ncontingency testing\\nand all animals including\\nhumans you\\'ll find,\\nstart to up the stakes.\\nAnd inevitably in group play,\\none member of the group\\nwill kind of break rules.\\nYou see this also in puppies.\\nSo for instance, puppies\\nwill bite one another\\nwith those sharp little\\nneedle-like puppy teeth.\\nI remember when Costello had those teeth,\\nthose things were so darn sharp\\nand puppies will yelp\\nwhen one of their littermates bites them,\\nthat Yelp actually serves a very important\\ninhibitory function.\\nThis is well defined\\nto tell the other one that\\'s too tough,\\nand this is how animals learn soft bite.\\nOkay.\\nIf they don\\'t get that feedback\\nfrom other littermates,\\nthey never actually learn.\\nWhat\\'s too hard and what\\'s soft.\\nAnd so humans do this as well.\\nNow you can look at your adult,\\ncounterparts,\\nand indeed we should probably\\nlook at ourselves and ask,\\nyou know did we learn\\nproper play contingency\\nwhen we were younger?\\nDo we tend to take things too seriously?\\nDo we tend to overreact aggressively\\nwhen other people are clearly engaging in,\\nyou know, playful, jabbing or sarcasm\\nor things of that sort.\\nSo each of you will have a\\ndifferent experience of this,\\nbut the point is that play\\nserves many functions,\\nit\\'s not just about the self.\\nIt\\'s also about interactions\\nbetween multiple people.\\nIt\\'s about rule testing\\nand low stakes contingency\\nrule breaking also\\nserves an important role\\nas is with the example\\nof the \"Dirt Clod War\"\\npuppies biting other puppies et cetera.\\nAnd last but not least,\\nthere are different forms of play\\nthat help us establish who\\nwe will become as adults.\\nOne of the more powerful of these\\nis role play when children\\nand sometimes adults\\nwill take on different\\nroles that are distinct\\nfrom their natural world roles\\nin order to for instance,\\nestablish hierarchies.\\nSo someone\\'s going to be the leader\\nand someone\\'s going to be the follower.\\nSomeone will be dominant.\\nSomeone will be submissive.\\nSomeone will work alone.\\nOther people will work in a group.\\nThese kinds of role playing\\nare again ways in which\\nthe prefrontal cortex\\nhas to expand the number of operations\\nin neuroscience we call these algorithms\\nthat it has to run in\\norder to make predictions.\\nYou have to take in a lot of information\\nabout your environment all the time\\nand make predictions.\\nBut if you are suddenly\\ncast into a new role,\\nwell then you definitely have to\\nmake even more predictions\\nfrom a different standpoint.\\nSo these are very powerful\\nfor teaching the brain,\\nhow to function.\\nI had a sister growing\\nup, I still have a sister,\\nfortunately,\\nand she and her friends\\nlargely played with dolls\\nand doll houses in the room next door.\\nAnd they take on different roles.\\nIn fact, some kids,\\nif they play alone\\nwill start to take on the role of leader\\nby taking on an imaginary or\\ncreating an imaginary friend.\\nAnd, you know, my apologies to my sibling,\\nbut for a long time,\\nshe had an imaginary friend\\neventually that imaginary\\nfriend disappeared.\\nI don\\'t know the science\\naround imaginary friends\\nand what it makes them disappear or not\\nat what stage of development,\\nbut imaginary friends are pretty common.\\nAnd that\\'s just another\\nway of being able to,\\nyou know boss somebody around,\\nif that\\'s your thing,\\nor to do engage in cooperative play.\\nSo we can look at this\\nstage of development,\\nwe call childhood\\nand we can look at each stage\\nof it and we can say, wow,\\nthere are all these\\ndifferent dimensions of play\\nthat really are about testing out\\nhow we feel comfortable or uncomfortable,\\nhow we react good or bad,\\nhow we react with stress or with glee\\nwhen others behave in certain ways.\\nAnd so what I\\'m hoping is coming through\\nis that play is not just about having fun.\\nPlay is about testing.\\nIt\\'s about experimenting\\nand it\\'s about expanding\\nyour brain\\'s capacity.\\nAnd that\\'s through early in development,\\nand it\\'s through throughout the lifespan.\\nSo at this point in the discussion,\\nI want to take a step back,\\nlook at the biology and\\nneurochemistry of play\\njust a little bit.\\nAnd that really define\\nwhat is effective play.\\nIf the goal of play is to\\nexplore different contingencies\\nin low stakes environments\\nand to expand the function\\nof our prefrontal cortex\\nso that we can see new possibilities\\nand new ways of being become\\nmore flexible, more creative,\\nmore effective outside\\nof the games of play\\nor the arenas of play, I should say.\\nWell then we should be asking,\\nhow do I know if I\\'m playing?\\nHow do I know if I\\'m playing correctly?\\nTurns out there\\'s an answer to that.\\nEarlier I referred to this brain area,\\nthe periaqueductal gray\\nthat releases opioids,\\nendogenous opioids into\\nour brain and body,\\nand tends to relax us a bit.\\nIt actually is what leads to\\nthese things like soft eyes\\nand head tilts and\\npuppies making, you know,\\npuppy postures and things of that sort,\\nand how that opens up the\\nnumber of different functions\\nor algorithms that the\\nprefrontal cortex can run,\\nbut there\\'s another piece of the puzzle,\\nwhich is for something to\\ngenuinely be play and playful,\\nand for it to have this\\neffect of expanding our brain\\nand engaging neuroplasticity\\nof really changing our brain\\nso that we can see and engaging\\nmore possible behaviors\\nand thoughts et cetera.\\nWe also have to have low\\namounts of adrenaline,\\nso called epinephrine\\nin our brain in body.\\nNow the background science\\nfor this is quite extensive,\\nbut for those of you that\\nare interested in papers\\nand manuscripts,\\nperhaps the best one is a review published\\nin Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews\\nby the very Jaak Panksepp\\nalthough he has a co-author,\\nwhich is Stephen Siviy,\\nS I V I Y\\nI\\'ll provide a link to this\\nin the caption show notes.\\nAnd the title of this paper is;\\n\"In Search of the\\nNeurobiological Substrates for\\nSocial Playfulness in Mammalian Brains.\"\\nAnd it\\'s a quite extensive review,\\nbut it basically boils down\\nto some key findings\\nwhereby, any sorts of drugs\\nor behaviors or scenarios\\nthat increase levels\\nof adrenaline too much,\\nwill tend to inhibit play\\nand drugs and scenarios\\nand I\\'m not suggesting\\nrecreational drugs here,\\nbut these were experiments that were done\\nin the laboratory setting\\nthat increase the endogenous opioid output\\nwill tend to increase playfulness.\\nAnd so really the state of mind\\nthat one needs to adopt when playing is,\\nfirst of all you have to\\nengage in the play it,\\nwhatever it happens to be\\nwith some degree of focus\\nand seriousness\\nand focus and seriousness in\\nthe neurobiological context\\ngenerally means epinephrine\\nbeing able to focus is largely reliant on\\nthings like adrenaline epinephrine,\\nbut also the presence of dopamine,\\nwhich is a molecule that\\ngenerates motivation\\nand focus in concert with epinephrine,\\nbut also that these endogenous\\nopioids be liberated.\\nAnd it\\'s really the low\\nstakes feature of play\\nthat allows those endogenous\\nopioids to be liberated.\\nWhat do I mean by that?\\nWell, if you are very, very\\nconcerned about the outcome,\\nlike you\\'ve put a lot of money\\non the table in a given game,\\nor you\\'re a football\\nplayer in the Super Bowl,\\nor you\\'re playing a game for which,\\nyou know, defeating the other person\\nor your team winning is\\nabsolutely crucial to you.\\nWell then that\\'s not\\nreally going to who engage\\nthe play circuitry.\\nOn the contrary,\\nif you are engaging in\\nthose same behaviors\\nor any other behavior in a way\\nthat you\\'re simply there to explore,\\nbut you don\\'t have high levels\\nof adrenaline in your system,\\nyou\\'re not stressed about\\nthe potential outcome.\\nWell, then that constitutes play.\\nNow that\\'s somewhat\\nobvious on the one hand\\nthat you take seriously\\nwhat you take seriously,\\nand you can be more playful about things\\nthat you don\\'t take so seriously,\\nbut what is absolutely not obvious\\nis that the state of playfulness\\nis actually what allows\\nyou to perform best\\nbecause the state of playfulness\\noffers you the opportunity to engage\\nin novel types of\\nbehaviors and interactions\\nthat you would not\\notherwise be able to access\\nif you are so focused\\non the outcome. Okay.\\nSo a state of playfulness\\nis absolutely critical,\\nnot just during play,\\nbut during competitive\\nscenarios of any kind.\\nI actually started to cultivate\\na practice related to this.\\nWhen I was in college,\\nI had this kind of general practice\\nof when I wanted to learn something.\\nI would tell myself that\\nit was the most important\\ninformation in the world\\nand that I was very very interested in it.\\nI would kind of lie to myself\\nand say oh, I\\'m super interested in,\\nI won\\'t name the topics,\\nbut super interested in this\\nor super interested in that.\\nAnd I could sort of delude\\nmyself into being hyper focused\\non whatever it is\\nthat I was learning\\nin ways that surprised me.\\nHowever,\\nwhen we are hyper focused on something\\nand we are rigidly\\nattached to the outcome,\\nwe can\\'t engage in flexible thinking.\\nSo it\\'s a great tool to be\\nhyper-focused on something\\nand take it very, very seriously\\nwhen we\\'re simply trying to learn things\\nby kind of rote memory,\\nlearn things and regurgitate,\\nlearn and regurgitate of the sort that,\\nyou know, I\\'m frankly a\\nlot of schooling involves.\\nBut if we are trying to\\nget better at something,\\nwe sort of hit a wall\\nin athletic performance\\nor in cognitive performance,\\nwhere we\\'re not creative enough,\\nwhere we\\'re finding\\nlet\\'s just use a sports example\\nthat, you know we only have\\na certain number of moves\\nthat we can deploy\\nor certain number of swings of the racket\\nthat we can deploy.\\nThe way to actually expand your practice\\nis to engage in this kind\\nof low stakes thinking,\\nthe idea that, well, I\\'m just\\ngoing to kind of play and tinker.\\nI\\'m going to explore in a way\\nthat it doesn\\'t really matter\\nif the ball goes back over\\nthe net,\\ndoesn\\'t really matter if\\nthe ball goes in the hole\\nand it\\'s counterintuitive\\nbecause you think,\\nno, the thing that we need\\nto do is drill and drill\\nand drill and drill.\\nAnd indeed there\\'s a place for that.\\nBut this mode of play with modest levels\\nof endogenous opioids being\\nreleased in our system,\\nplus low levels of adrenaline, right?\\nEpinephrine low levels of\\nepinephrine and adrenaline\\nare possible only when\\nthe stakes are low enough\\nthat we\\'re not stressed.\\nWell that combination really\\nallows the prefrontal cortex\\nto explore different possibilities\\nin ways that can truly expand\\nour capabilities over time.\\nNow, this has been seen again and again,\\nalso in the business sector,\\nsome of the more challenging,\\nor I should say compare additive\\ncompanies to get jobs at\\nare very interested in hiring people\\nthat as children were so called tinkerers,\\nand actually NASA was\\nfirst famous for this,\\nthat many of the people\\nthat achieved great success\\nin engineering at NASA,\\nwhen they looked back into\\ntheir childhood histories,\\nthose people tended to be tinkerers.\\nThey were people that would\\nkind of play with things\\nin way that wasn\\'t about\\nrigidly following a recipe\\nor an instruction manual.\\nGreat cooks discover new forms of food.\\nIndeed created entire genres of food\\nby way of being tinkerers.\\nOkay, musicians do this.\\nI grew up playing various sports,\\nbut skateboarding was one that\\nI was particularly involved\\nin for a long time.\\nOne of the greatest\\nskateboarders of all time\\nis some of you may recognize his name\\nas the Great Rodney Mullen.\\nAnd Rodney was kind of\\nfamous for evolving the sport\\nand continuing to evolve the sport in ways\\nthat no one could predict\\nusing skateboards and all sorts of ways\\nthat no one had thought of previously.\\nAnd of course there\\nare other skateboarders\\nthat did that as well,\\nbut he\\'s particularly well known for that.\\nAnd his process is his own.\\nI can\\'t speak to it too much,\\nbut he was also known\\nas a kind of a tinker\\nas somebody who would spend a lot of time,\\njust kind of flipping the board\\nand just flipping it into the air\\nand watching the ways in which it flipped\\nand kind of studying\\nthe physics of it really\\nand expanding on his\\nexisting understanding\\nof what could happen on a skateboard\\nby way of just playing.\\nNow, he took it very seriously,\\nbut it\\'s this kind of razor\\'s edge\\nbetween taking something very seriously,\\nbut also tinkering and\\nplaying and exploring\\nand just seeing what\\nhappens and kind of like,\\nwell, let\\'s just see what\\nhappens if we did this,\\nthat mindset is extremely powerful\\nto export from this\\nthing that we call play\\ninto what we could call\\nmore serious endeavor\\nof one\\'s occupation or sport,\\nwhether or not it\\'s behind a desk\\nor whether or not it\\'s\\nrunning around on a field\\nreally for or engineering, any endeavor.\\nAnd so the whole purpose\\nof this episode on play\\nis yes on the one hand\\nto illustrate the incredible\\nevolutionary utility of play\\nfor setting up the self\\nand relation of the self to others,\\nindeed for setting up cultures entirely,\\ncuz\\' cultures will watch sport together\\nor they\\'ll celebrate their team winning.\\nI mean, World Cup,\\nI\\'ve never been a big soccer fan,\\neven though my dad is\\nArgentine, but it\\'s incredible.\\nI mean the entire world kind of lights up\\nand gets engaged around\\nwhether or not their team,\\ntheir country is going\\nto win the Olympics also\\nbeing another example,\\nbut play and sport are not quite the same\\nas I\\'ve pointed out before.\\nAnd for all of us who\\nare thinking about tools\\nand things that we can\\nextract from science\\nto enrich our lives,\\nI would say for those of\\nyou that are already playing\\non a regular basis\\nin one form or another\\nterrific start to expand\\nother forms of play\\nin particular forms of play\\nthat involve new groups of individuals.\\nSo if you\\'re somebody that typically plays\\none-on-one with somebody,\\ntry to expand into playing as teams.\\nIf you\\'re somebody who only plays alone,\\nthen try to expand into playing in perhaps\\none-on-one first and in groups,\\nthis is the way that your brain learns\\nand evolves and changes and gets better.\\nAnd I raised this because\\nanother one of the top 10 questions I get\\nis how can I keep my brain young?\\nHow can I continue to learn?\\nHow can I get better in school\\nand sport in life and\\nrelationships, et cetera,\\nemotionally, cognitively,\\nand on and on and on.\\nAnd yes,\\nthere are supplements that\\ncan support neuroplasticity.\\nYes, there are brain games and apps\\nthat can support neuroplasticity.\\nBut if you really want to engage\\nneuroplasticity at any age,\\nwhat you need to do is\\nreturn to the same sorts\\nof practices and tools\\nthat your nervous system naturally used\\nthroughout development.\\nAnd it evolved over hundreds\\nof thousands of years\\nto trigger this thing that\\nwe call neuroplasticity.\\nAnd the reason this is\\nso important is because\\nit starts to move us away from\\nwhat some people call hacks.\\nI define hacks as using one\\nthing for a different purpose\\nto kind of get a shortcut.\\nI don\\'t really like the term, frankly,\\nand I don\\'t like it\\nbecause it\\'s not grounded\\nin any biological mechanism.\\nBut when we look at play,\\nwe can say, play is the portal to plastic.\\nPlay at every stage of life\\nis the way in which we learned the rules\\nfor that stage of life.\\nAnd play is the way in\\nwhich we were able to test\\nhow we might function in\\nthe real world context.\\nSo play is powerful.\\nAnd we could even say that play\\nis the most powerful portal\\nto plasticity.\\nThe reason for that is that\\nyes, this high opioid, low\\nepinephrine or adrenaline state\\nis what opens up play.\\nBut then inside of the arena of play,\\nwhen the prefrontal cortex is running\\nall these different possibilities\\nin this low stakes way.\\nBut with some degree of focus,\\nthere are a number of other\\nchemicals that are deployed.\\nThings like Brain-derived\\nneurotrophic factor\\nand other growth factors that actually\\ntrigger the rewiring of brain circuits\\nthat allow for it to expand.\\nAnd indeed that\\'s what is neuroplasticity.\\nIf you\\'re interested in those chemicals\\nand kind of arena of things that happen\\nwhen one engages in neuroplasticity,\\nthere\\'s a vast literature out there.\\nBut one of the more popular books\\nthat I think is quite good\\nis from my friend and\\ncolleague, John Ratey,\\nwho\\'s a psychiatrist at\\nHarvard Medical School.\\nThat\\'s R A T E Y.\\nHe wrote the book \"Spark\"\\na few years back,\\nand I think it\\'s still very relevant.\\nAnd John talks about\\nthe important role that play\\nexerts in the neuroplasticity process\\nand points to a number\\nof different protocols\\nthat one can engage in.\\nHe also points to the\\nimportance of navigating\\nnew environments\\nto not just go on the\\nsame hike every week,\\nor take the same walk,\\nbut actually get into\\nnew novel environments.\\nSo you\\'re starting to sense a theme here.\\nThere\\'s novelty,\\nexploring contingencies,\\nkeeping the stakes relatively low,\\net cetera, et cetera.\\nBut these really are the gates\\nto this holy grail that\\nwe call neuroplasticity.\\nNeuroplasticity as I\\'ve talked\\nabout in the podcast before\\nis a two step process.\\nIt involves focusing very intensely\\nor at least focusing\\nsomewhat on whatever it is\\nthat one is trying to learn,\\nand then engaging in deep rest,\\nideally deep sleep in\\nthe following nights.\\nAnd I\\'ve also talked about\\nthe benefits of things\\nlike naps and Yoga Nidra so-called NSDR,\\nNon Sleep Deep Rest\\nfor enhancing or accelerating plasticity.\\nYou can check out the episodes\\non Focus at hubermanlab.com\\nor the episodes on How to Learn Faster.\\nThe detail all of those.\\nWe had a newsletter that lists out\\nall the tools for neuroplasticity\\nenhancing neuroplasticity,\\nall that is available.\\nZero cost to you at\\nhubermalab.com, et cetera.\\nYou can just download that information,\\nbut John\\'s book that\\nnewsletter those episodes.\\nThey really point to this two step process\\nwhere it\\'s focus and then rest\\nfocus and then rest\\nand play is its own unique form\\nof focus and then rest, focus and rest.\\nIt\\'s not the same as learning\\nsomething for sake of school\\nor critically trying to\\nlearn a motor behavior\\nfor sake of sport.\\nIt\\'s really about expanding\\nthe number of things\\nthat you could learn down the line.\\nOkay, so said once again.\\nSo I just want to make\\nsure it\\'s abundantly clear\\nplay is about establishing\\na broader framework\\nwithin which you can learn new things.\\nIt\\'s not about learning\\nsome specific thing.\\nIt\\'s not about the game\\nyou happen to be playing.\\nIt\\'s not about the dollhouse\\nthat the kids are playing with\\nso that they can become\\namazing dollhouse players\\nwhen they grow up. Right.\\nThe dirt Clod war that\\nI referred to earlier\\nfor better or for worse\\nwas not about becoming\\nthe best dirt clod thrower\\nor winning the trophy for dirt clods\\nin the neighborhood.\\nAlthough we actually had a trophy\\nfor the best dirt clod team.\\nAlas, it was not my team that year.\\nBut the point is that\\nyou\\'re learning rules\\nand establishing a broader\\nfoundation of practices\\nthat then can learn more\\nthings within that context.\\nThus far I\\'ve tried to convince you\\nthrough a combination of data\\nand anecdote and explanation\\nthat adopting a stance of playfulness\\nand indeed engaging in play\\non a somewhat regular basis\\ncould be beneficial to you\\nregardless of circumstances or goals.\\nIf I haven\\'t done that already,\\nwhat I\\'m about to tell you,\\nhopefully will push you over the line.\\nIt turns out that when you\\nlook across the kingdom\\nof all animals,\\nwhat you find is that animals\\nthat engage in playful behaviors\\nfor the longest period of time\\nare also the animals that\\nhave the greatest degree\\nof neuroplasticity,\\nthe brain and nervous system\\'s ability\\nto change in response to experience,\\nput differently,\\nanimals that only play\\nfor a very small fraction\\nof their entire life\\nhave very rigid brains that\\ndon\\'t learn new things,\\nwhereas animals that\\nplay for a long period\\nthroughout their life\\nhave very plastic brains.\\nAnd there\\'s even some\\nevidence that\\'s at this point,\\nlargely anecdotal,\\nbut there\\'s some data starting to emerge\\nthat adults that maintain a playful stance\\nthat engage in things again\\nthat are low stakes contingency exploring\\nimportant enough that people focus\\nand that people pay attention\\nto what they\\'re doing,\\nbut that they are not, you know,\\nfilled with adrenaline, you know,\\nfreaked out about the\\noutcome being A or B,\\nthey\\'re not super, super competitive,\\nmaybe just a little bit competitive\\nor not competitive at all.\\nThat allows for more ongoing plasticity.\\nAnd one of the people that comes to mind\\nin thinking about this is\\nof course the Physicist,\\nand I should say the Great\\nPhysicist, Richard Feynman,\\nNobel Prize Winner Professor at Caltech\\nwas involved in the Manhattan Project,\\nbut was also known for being\\na lifelong tinker, right?\\nHe also is a mischievous tinker.\\nIf you read any of the books\\nabout Feynman or by Feynman\\n\"Surely You\\'re Joking.\"\\nMr. Feynman, or \"What Do You\\nCare What Other People Think?\"\\nthese are wonderful short stories,\\nmostly about Feynman,\\ndoing things like\\npicking all the locks at\\nthe Los Alamos Laboratory\\nand putting all the top secret documents\\nout on the floor of the office\\nso that when people\\ncame men in the morning,\\nthey were all out there.\\nObviously they weren\\'t\\nreleased to the general public.\\nHe didn\\'t want to threaten\\nnational security,\\nbut playing pranks like that.\\nAnd actually Caltech,\\nI don\\'t know if this is still the case,\\nbut Caltech where he was employed\\nwas always known for doing very\\ntechnologically challenging pranks.\\nThey\\'re not known for their\\nathletic pros at Caltech,\\nsorry, Caltech,\\nbut they were known for example,\\ndisrupting the scoreboard at\\nthe Rose Bowl in Pasadena,\\nfor instance,\\nand things of that sort\\nthrough technological\\nfeats, at least at the time\\nrequired a lot of playfulness\\nand technological pros.\\nSo if you look in science\\nor you look in art,\\nor you look in medicine\\nor you in any domain,\\nwhat you find is the people\\nthat continue to evolve\\nnew practices\\ntend to be people that were tinkerers.\\nPeople that are very creative,\\ntend to be people that are unafraid\\nof exploring things in\\na, this low stakes way.\\nThey\\'re not so rigidly\\nattached to the outcome\\nthat they have to do everything\\nperfectly all the time.\\nNow they might cloak\\nthese playful behaviors\\nso that their final works\\nalways look perfect or\\nalways look incredible,\\nbut they have this kind of\\nplayful nature about them.\\nI would venture even say that the,\\nthe street artist Banksy, for instance,\\nobviously an incredible\\nartist puts a ton of thought\\nand preparation into their work,\\nbut there\\'s a kind of playfulness\\nto the whole thing too,\\nof using two dimensional paintings\\nin concert with three\\ndimensional city dwellings\\nin ways that,\\nyou know I think that most\\npeople hadn\\'t previously,\\nthere were other people\\nlike Christo and, you know,\\nartists of that sort that did that.\\nBut I think Banksy is kind of recognized\\nas the modern, the modern rendition\\nof that kind of playfulness\\nusing cities in ways\\nthat most people don\\'t use cities\\nusing art in ways that\\nmost people don\\'t use art,\\nfor instance.\\nSo to go back to the example of Feynman.\\nFeynman was somebody who learned to paint\\nand draw quite well into his sixties.\\nHe was somewhat famous or infamous,\\nI should say for Bongo Drumming\\non the roof of Caltech.\\nI say infamous because\\nhe was known also for doing that naked.\\nSomething that certainly not in concert\\nwith the ethical standards and behaviors\\nof universities today.\\nBut Feynman had this\\nplayful spirit as a child.\\nHe had that playful spirit as a teenager,\\nand he had that playful\\nspirit as an adult.\\nAnd that\\'s one of the\\nwhole hallmarks of Feynman\\nwas that he wasn\\'t just a rigid physicist\\nwho could explain things\\nclearly to the general public.\\nHe always carried through\\nthis playful spirit\\nand in some of his writings,\\nhe pointed to the fact\\nthat that playful spirit\\nwas something that he worked very hard\\nto continue to cultivate in himself\\nbecause it was the way\\nin which he could see\\nthe world differently\\nand to indeed make great discoveries\\nin the field of physics,\\nbut also to kind of\\nevolve his relationship\\nto life more generally.\\nAnd so he comes to mind\\nas a prominent example\\nof somebody who did this.\\nAnd if I could achieve\\nanything with this episode,\\nbesides teaching you something\\nabout the biology of play,\\nit would be to teach you\\nabout the utility of play.\\nAgain, I\\'m,\\ndon\\'t consider myself a\\nparticularly playful person\\nby nature,\\nbut I\\'ve tried over the years to adopt\\nthis stance of exploring\\nthings that are, you know,\\nvery focused on contingencies\\nof different kinds,\\nbut keep the stakes low enough\\nthat I can have some fun doing them.\\nAnd I like to think that\\nit\\'s benefited me somewhat.\\nNow, I\\'d like to drill\\na little bit further\\ninto this thing that we\\ncalled neuroplasticity.\\nAgain neuroplasticity is the\\nbrain and nervous system\\'s\\nability to change in\\nresponse to experience.\\nAnd I should just say that\\nthroughout the entire lifespan,\\nthe nervous system can change very quickly\\nin response to negative experiences.\\nWe can almost all engage in\\nwhat\\'s called one trial learning\\nwhere if something really\\nterrible or traumatic happens\\nto us,\\nour nervous system will\\nrewire almost immediately,\\nat least within a few days,\\nsuch that we tend to want\\nto avoid the experience\\nthat led to that trauma.\\nNow the whole business of\\nwhy people return to things\\nthat are traumatic to them\\nis a whole other issue.\\nThere are books about\\nthings like trauma bonding.\\nThere\\'s the so-called\\nrepetition compulsion\\nfrom psychoanalysis\\nthat people go back into trauma to retest\\nand gain new opportunities\\nto overcome the trauma,\\net cetera, et cetera.\\nBut in general, what I\\'m\\nreferring to here is,\\nyou know,\\nyou have a bad experience\\nat the swimming pool\\nwhen you\\'re a kid\\nwhere someone holds your\\nhead underwater too long,\\nand then you just don\\'t want\\nto get back in the water.\\nThat\\'s one trial learning of sorts,\\nthat of course can be overcomed\\nthrough proper exposure therapy\\nor someone that you\\ntrust taking you there,\\nor any number of behaviors\\nthat allow you to overcome that,\\nbe that particular scenario\\nand experience something new\\nin that same context.\\nBut across the lifespan,\\nthe learn earning of new\\nthings, new contingencies,\\nnew possibilities\\noccurs very differently\\nfrom about age zero when we\\'re born\\nuntil about age 25 and thereafter.\\nSo from about, about,\\nI want to emphasize\\napproximately age 25 onward\\nneuroplasticity occurs through the process\\nthat is exactly as I\\ndescribed before, focus, rest,\\nfocus, rest, we focus very intensely.\\nWe can\\'t do the thing.\\nWe can\\'t do the new movement.\\nWe can\\'t do the golf swing.\\nWe can\\'t learn the math.\\nWe try, we try, we try, we\\ntry, we sleep a few nights.\\nAnd then all of a sudden\\nwe can do it, right,\\nbecause the rewiring actually\\noccurs during deep rest\\nor naps,\\nbut mostly during deep sleep.\\nFrom birth till about out age 25 however,\\nwe can learn things, new things,\\nand new contingencies,\\nnot just negative things\\nand traumatic things\\nthrough somewhat passive\\nexposure to those things, right.\\nI will never forget the first time\\nthat we went on a family\\ntrip to Washington DC.\\nAnd we went to the Smithsonian.\\nI got to see the, the old fighter planes.\\nAnd I think,\\nI think the Kitty Hawk\\nor the first one of the\\nfirst planes was there.\\nAnyway, I obviously my\\nrecollection isn\\'t terrific.\\nMy hippocampus is, is\\nflailing on that one,\\nbut I\\'ll never forget the trip.\\nAnd I\\'ll never forget who went.\\nAnd I think I was probably\\neight or nine years old.\\nIt\\'s embedded somewhere in my memory.\\nAnd so just through passive experience\\nand my focusing on the\\nthings that excited me\\nabout that trip,\\nI have a recollection of that experience.\\nI didn\\'t have to deliberately focus.\\nI didn\\'t, wasn\\'t telling myself focused,\\nyou\\'re going to need to\\nremember this trip someday\\nand you\\'re going to be\\npodcasting about this,\\nyou know, in 39 years, or whenever\\nagain, I forget exactly how old I was.\\nBut the key feature here is that\\nthe developing brain is able\\nto learn through passive experience\\nbecause the neurons, the nerve\\ncells in the developing brain\\nare much more over-connected\\nthan they will be later in life.\\nThe way to think about this is sort of,\\nif you use Google maps,\\nas I do too often I think\\nwhen I drive,\\nthere are a number of roads and pathways\\nthat would get you from\\npoint A to point B.\\nWe could imagine those as neural circuits,\\nor we could imagine neural\\ncircuits as those roads.\\nEarly in development,\\nthe nerve connections\\nare much more extensive.\\nIt it\\'s like having a Google maps\\nthat where everything is\\nconnected to everything\\nthrough tiny little cross streets.\\nAnd the whole thing is\\njust a complete mess.\\nBut then by taking particular routes\\nof behavior of thought of emotion,\\ncertain routes become well established.\\nAnd the other routes that are not taken\\nsimply disappear.\\nNow in the biological\\ncontext in the brain,\\nwe call that process pruning.\\nAnd the simple way to envision\\nthis is early in development.\\nYou have many, many more\\nneurons than you will have\\nas an adult.\\nThose neurons are\\nextensively interconnected,\\nand approximately 40% of\\nthose interconnections\\nwill disappear by the\\ntime you\\'re 25 years old,\\nthey are gone.\\nThey are actively\\nremoved through processes\\nthat involve things like\\nglial cells that come in\\nand literally sneak their little processes\\nin between neurons at the synapse,\\nwhich are the points of\\ncontact and communication\\nbetween neurons and push those apart,\\neven eat neurons, right?\\nThere\\'s some incredible\\nwork from for instance,\\nBeth Stevens\\' Lab at\\nHarvard Medical School,\\nshowing that glial cells\\ngo in and eat synapses\\nthat are not functional for\\nthat particular circuit.\\nNow, what this tells us is\\nthat much of our learning\\nduring development is the\\nremoval of incorrect connections,\\nbut it also involves the\\nstrengthening of connections\\nthat are going to serve certain\\nemotions, certain functions,\\nmotor functions, cognitive\\nfunctions, et cetera.\\nThe process of play\\nis largely a process of engaging pruning\\nof neural connections\\nand strengthening of the\\nremaining connections.\\nI\\'m sure that many of\\nyou have heard the term\\nfire together wire together.\\nThat phrase is often\\nincorrectly attributed\\nto the great Donald Hebb,\\nwho indeed was great.\\nDid incredible work a\\npsychologist from Canada\\nwho established a lot of the\\nbasic cellar learning rules\\nfor learning and memory,\\nbut it was the also great Dr. Carla Shatz,\\nwho is now at Stanford\\nand was at Berkeley and Harvard as well,\\nbut who is at Stanford Medical School\\nwho coined this term fire\\ntogether wire together.\\nIndeed that\\'s what happens\\nwhen children play\\nwhen adolescents play\\nand when young adults play,\\nwhether or not it\\'s social play\\nor play with an object,\\nwhether or not it\\'s a\\nsport or a play of any kind\\nimaginary play imaginary friend play,\\nthere is a strengthening of\\ncertain neural connections\\nand a pruning away of up to 40%,\\nperhaps even more of connections\\nthat are not necessary for\\ncertain types of behaviors,\\nemotions, and thoughts.\\nAnd what this means is\\nthat it is through the process of play,\\nthat we become who we are as adults.\\nAnd as I mentioned earlier,\\nit is through the process of play\\nthat we are able to adjust\\nwho we are as adults.\\nNow, there are bounds on this process,\\nas far as I know there\\'s\\nnever been a reported case\\nof an individual who had a hyperplastic\\nor I should say a brain that\\nwas as plastic in adulthood\\nas it was in childhood.\\nBut what this tells us is that\\nwhat we do in the process\\nof play as children\\nis really how we set up the rules\\nfor how we behave as adults\\nin almost all domains,\\nwhich is really incredible.\\nAnd of course the reassuring thing is that\\nplaying as an adult\\nwill allow you to expand\\non those neural circuits.\\nYou can literally grow new connections.\\nSome of you may be saying,\\ndoes it create new neurons\\nfor better or for worse?\\nIt does not seem that\\nmany new neurons are added\\nto your brain in adulthood.\\nThere are some papers\\nthat report a few neurons\\nin certain brain areas,\\nisolated brain areas,\\nbut by and large,\\nmost of the rewiring of neural connections\\nis the removal of certain connections.\\nThis process we\\'re calling Pruning\\nand the strengthening of\\nthe remaining connections\\nthat make those kind of Google maps roads.\\nAnd the analogy I laid out before\\nthicker and more robust think about as\\ntaking little trails\\nand turning them into roads,\\nthen paving those roads.\\nThen turning those roads into highways,\\nthen putting up more\\nlanes on those highways\\nand eliminating all the small\\nlittle back-country roads\\nthat one could take.\\nAnd again,\\nthis is an analogy for what is happening\\nat the level of neuro circuitry.\\nNow,\\none of the key findings that\\nhas emerged from the literature\\nis children that have\\nbeen subjected to trauma\\nor immense amounts of stress of any kind,\\nhave a harder time both engaging in play,\\nbut also a harder time\\naccessing neuroplasticity later\\nin life.\\nThe good news is this is\\nnot a permanent effect.\\nAnd we\\'ll talk about some\\nof the ways to overcome that\\nin a moment,\\nbut this should make sense to you\\nbecause earlier we talked about\\nhow a high level of adrenaline\\nepinephrine in the brain and body\\nactually inhibits blocks the circuits\\nin the brain and body that\\ngenerate play behavior.\\nAnd when I say that,\\nI mean that in a very concrete way,\\nthat epinephrine and adrenaline\\ncan actually suppress\\nthe sorts of circuitry\\nthat can lead to things like soft eyes\\nor tongue out, or the head tilt,\\nor what we called partial postures\\nof being able to engage in,\\nyou know, a rough and tumble play,\\nbut not take that to the\\npoint of outright aggression\\nand damaging the other\\nperson or them damaging you.\\nSo when I say that,\\nyou know, trauma and stress\\ncan inhibit neuroplasticity\\nby way of inhibiting play\\nat a deeper neuro biological level.\\nWhat I\\'m really saying is\\nthat the high levels of adrenaline\\nthat are generated from\\ntrauma and stress actually\\nshut down the circuits\\nthat allow a child or a young adult\\nto enter the game of play\\nor in the game of play\\nin the same way that\\na child or young adult\\nwho didn\\'t have high levels of adrenaline\\nin their system could possibly engage in.\\nNow,\\nthe good news is that many of\\nthe existing trauma therapies\\nthat are out there now,\\nincluding things like EMDR\\nExposure Therapy, Cognitive\\nBehavioral therapy,\\nand on and on,\\nincluding some of the therapies\\nthat are more neurochemical,\\nthings like ketamine, or\\nare more engineering based,\\nthings like Transcranial magnetic\\nstimulation for instance,\\nmany of those are paired\\nwith forms of talk therapy\\nthat are really about the\\nsame thing that play is about,\\nwhich is exploring\\ndifferent contingencies.\\nIt\\'s about exploring different types\\nof emotional experiences\\nas they relate to the\\nsame sort of scenario\\nthat created the trauma.\\nAnd we did an entire\\nepisode on fear and trauma,\\nand I recommend you\\ncheck out that episode.\\nIt\\'s easy to find again\\nat hubermanlab.com,\\nit\\'s on YouTube, Apples,\\nSpotify, et cetera, et cetera,\\nvery easy to find.\\nAnd there I talk all\\nabout trauma treatments\\nand the various kinds of trauma treatments\\nthat are out there,\\ntheir efficacy in different\\nscenarios and traumas and so on.\\nBut the point I\\'d like to make now is that\\nthe reason why children who\\nexperience a lot of trauma\\nand stress have limited\\nplasticity later on\\nis because the neurochemical substrates\\nthat are created from trauma and stress,\\nbecause after all\\nstress is epinephrine and\\nepinephrine is stress.\\nThose are inseparable\\nand the way in which it\\nmore or less shuts down\\nor at least inhibits suppresses\\nthose play circuits.\\nAnd again the reassuring thing\\nis that by engaging in play as adults,\\nwe can reactivate some of those circuits\\nand reopen the plasticity.\\nIn fact one very prominent\\ntrauma treatment now,\\nespecially for people\\nthat have been subjected\\nto very severe traumas,\\nin the ongoing sense,\\nmeaning traumas that went\\non for many, many years\\nis to get them to engage in play\\nin things like dance\\nin basically getting them to engage\\ntheir bodily movements\\nin ways that they would otherwise\\nnot feel comfortable to engage in.\\nAnd I find this area so interesting\\nbecause on the face of it, you could say,\\noh, that\\'s kind of, you know,\\nis that really biomedical treatment?\\nYou know, you\\'re taking\\npeople who traumatized\\nand having them dance.\\nI mean, it seems kind of\\nsilly on the one hand,\\ndepending on your, you know,\\nyour particular orientation.\\nBut on the other hand,\\nit\\'s actually quite\\nprofound and quite grounded\\nin the mechanisms by which\\nthe brain circuits change.\\nSo again,\\nback to this original principle,\\nwhich is that play, isn\\'t\\njust one portal to plasticity\\nplay is the fundamental\\nportal to plasticity\\nand that play and dance\\nand exploration of novel movements,\\nexploration of novel athletic movements\\nare the route\\nby which we access new ways of thinking\\nnew contingencies.\\nAnd I find it wonderful\\nthat the trauma release\\nand the psychiatric and\\npsychology community\\nare exploring things like play and dance\\nand other forms of\\nreopening these circuits\\nbecause indeed we would all love\\nfor there to be a magic pill\\nby which trauma could be erased\\nand new memories could be laid down\\nor a device that could do that.\\nBut frankly, if you ask me\\nor a number of my colleagues,\\nwhether or not that\\'s likely\\nto happen anytime soon\\nin an effective way,\\nI think the short answer\\nis going to be no,\\nthat there are going to be chemicals\\nand things that can augment\\nand support that process,\\nbut that there\\'s not going\\nto be just a magic pill\\nthat will suddenly\\nreverse trauma altogether.\\nThat it\\'s always going\\nto be a case whereby\\nshifts in neurochemical states\\nare going to have to be combined\\nwith new ways of thinking\\nand new behaviors.\\nAnd I find it wonderful in reassuring\\nthat people are looking\\nat play and play behavior\\nas a not just one tiny\\nshard of possibility there,\\nbut that it might actually\\nbe the main driver\\nand a highly productive lever\\nby which to rewire the traumatized brain.\\nSo if you\\'re like me,\\nyou might be thinking,\\nokay, I\\'m willing to be more playful.\\nI\\'m willing to explore,\\nplay as a portal to plasticity.\\nAnd that all makes good sense,\\nbut what should I play?\\nWhat should I do?\\nWell, we\\'ve already established\\nthat you want to keep\\nyour adrenaline low.\\nYou have to keep the stakes slow enough\\nthat you\\'re not going to get\\ntotally consumed by the outcome.\\nNow, for some people who\\nare highly competitive,\\nthat\\'s going to be challenging.\\nAnd yet I don\\'t want to make it seem\\nas if you can\\'t be\\ncompetitive during play.\\nThere are many forms of competitive play\\nthat because you are a competitive person,\\nallow you to drive great joy\\nfrom that competitive play.\\nI have a friend who\\'s\\nparticularly good at horseshoes.\\nI\\'m not particularly good at horseshoes,\\nbut whenever we play horseshoes,\\nI can tell he\\'s out there\\nto crush me on horseshoes.\\nAnd it\\'s just one of these\\nthings where, you know,\\nI can tell he derives great pleasure\\nfrom crushing me at a game of horseshoes.\\nI can\\'t say because I\\nhaven\\'t actually done\\nthe microdialysis,\\nwhich is a way of extracting chemistry\\nfrom the brain in real time,\\nnor have I recorded from his\\nbrain or image it in a scanner,\\nwhether or not he has\\nhigh levels of epinephrine\\nor low levels of epinephrine.\\nDuring those games of horseshoes,\\nI suspect his low levels of epinephrine\\nand high levels of dopamine,\\nespecially when he wins.\\nAnd he has, he wins every time.\\nBut the win is that you can\\nbe competitive during play,\\nprovided that you were enjoying yourself.\\nOkay, you can be competitive\\nprovided that you were enjoying yourself.\\nThere are particular forms of play\\nthat lend themselves\\nbest to neuroplasticity.\\nAnd those particular forms of play again,\\nare not designed to\\nnecessarily just engage\\nthe plasticity that allows\\nyou to perform that behavior,\\nbut rather to expand the\\nnumber of possibilities\\nfor your brain to change\\nin general throughout life\\nand the two major forms of those\\nfor which there\\'s good\\nPeer Reviewed Research\\nis to engage in novel forms of movement,\\nincluding different speeds of movement.\\nSo let\\'s say for instance,\\nyou\\'re somebody who runs.\\nI happen to like running.\\nI try and run three times a week.\\nAnd generally when I run, I run forward,\\nI don\\'t run backward, although recently,\\nbecause I\\'ve become very excited\\nabout the work of so-called\\n\"Knees Over Toes Guy,\"\\nhis name is Ben Parker,\\nbut he goes by \"Knees Over\\nToes Guy\" on Instagram.\\nI\\'ve never met him,\\nbut we\\'ve exchanged a few\\nmessages back and forth.\\nAnd some of his practices involve\\nwalking backwards or doing\\nsled poles backwards.\\nI found these to be very beneficial\\nfor my back and for my,\\nyou know, interior tibialis\\nand some things that have really helped\\nwith my posture and so forth.\\nBut in general, when I run, I run forward,\\nI don\\'t tend to run backward that much.\\nAnd I might do that for\\na few minutes at the end,\\nbut not so much throughout the entire run.\\nRunning doesn\\'t lend itself\\nto a lot of novel forms\\nof movement, lateral movements.\\nSo for the nerds out there\\nmovement in the Sagittal plane\\nor angled movements,\\nbut it does appear that\\nthings like dance or sports\\nwhere you end up generating\\na lot of dynamic movements\\nwhere there\\'s jumping,\\nwhere there\\'s movement\\nat different angles,\\nwhere there\\'s ducking,\\nwhere there\\'s leaping,\\nthat basically involve a\\nlot of dynamic movement.\\nAnd aren\\'t just strictly linear.\\nThose seem to open the\\nportals for plasticity.\\nAnd that\\'s because they mimic\\na lot of the brain circuitry\\nthat is associated with play.\\nAnd the reason for that\\nis the way in which\\nthose dynamic movements\\nand movements of different speeds\\nengage the vestibular system.\\nThe balance system,\\nthe vestibular system is in the inner ear,\\nrelates to the cerebellum,\\nwhich translates the mini brain.\\nYou got a little mini brain\\nin the back of your brain.\\nIt brings together visual\\ninformation in a very direct way.\\nI talked a lot about this in the episode\\non how to learn faster.\\nSo if you want to go in\\ndepth on how vestibular\\nand different types of motor\\nmovements can open plasticity,\\nI talk a little bit more, I\\nshould say a lot more there,\\nbut suffice to say that engaging in play\\nthat has a lot of dynamic movement\\nor movements of different speeds,\\nthings like dance,\\nthings like sports,\\nlike soccer where you\\'re\\nmoving in different dimensions.\\nThat tends to be very conducive\\nto what we would call\\nplay related circuitry\\nprovided you don\\'t take it too seriously.\\nYou don\\'t get those high\\nlevels of epinephrine.\\nNow for those of you that\\nare also interested in non-physical\\nor non-athletic forms of play\\nthat can really expand plasticity.\\nThere\\'s some very interesting research\\nabout the game of Chess.\\nI don\\'t play the game of Chess.\\nI\\'ve played a few times.\\nI confess I don\\'t know how\\nto move all the pieces.\\nSo I\\'m not going to try\\nand describe that here,\\nbut I\\'ve always wanted to learn Chess.\\nAnd I think after reading some\\nof the Peer Reviewed Research\\nabout chess and play and neuroplasticity,\\nnow I understand why\\nthere\\'s a really nice paper\\npublished in the International\\nJournal of Research\\nin Education and Science in 2017.\\nAnd the title of this paper is,\\n\"Is Chess Just a Game or Is It a Mirror\\nThat Reflects a Child\\'s Inner World?\"\\nThat\\'s a very, a very intense title\\nfor a biologist like me,\\nbut this paper is so interesting\\nbecause what it really points to is\\nthe fact that in a single game chess,\\nyou have at least as I\\nunderstand two players,\\nand those two players are moving\\npieces on the chess board,\\nfor which each piece can\\ndo different things, right?\\nCan move in different ways\\nunder different scenarios,\\nbut they\\'re different\\nrules for different pieces.\\nAnd so each player actually has to assume\\nmultiple identities during the same game.\\nAnd each of those identities\\nhas different rules\\nand ways of interacting.\\nSo in a way we can think\\nof chess as one game,\\nbut actually chess is\\na kind of a substrate\\nfor exploring multiple roles\\nfor different characters.\\nAnd this is quite a bit different\\nthan for instance, video games\\nwhere somebody has their\\nfavorite video game player,\\nor they have an avatar.\\nAnd they\\'re always in the same role.\\nIt\\'s also quite a bit different\\nfor when you engage in any kind of play\\nwhere you are yourself,\\nyou\\'re just being you in that game.\\nAnd so now I\\'m highly\\nincentivized to explore chess.\\nYou see quotes out there, for instance,\\nthings like \"Chess is life\\nor jiu jitsu is life.\"\\nI always assumed that that\\nmeant that someone\\'s entire life\\nwas chess\\nor their entire life was\\njiu jitsu for instance,\\nbut in reading over the research\\nabout chess in particular,\\nbut at also certain forms of martial arts,\\nalso certain forms of dance.\\nWhat one finds is that\\nindeed those games are life\\nin the sense that they involve\\nadopting multiple roles\\nand exploring contingencies\\nin a number of different ways.\\nSo there are some games\\nthat allow you to explore\\na much vaster landscape\\nof movements or of mental roles\\nor of ways of engaging\\nin strategic movement\\nas is the case with chess.\\nAnd so when you hear that,\\nyou know, activity blank is life.\\nIt often reflects the\\npassion for that activity,\\nbut I think looked at differently.\\nIt also reflects the\\nfact that that activity\\nis a portal through which\\nyou can explore life\\nthrough many, many different lenses.\\nAnd I think that that\\'s\\nespecially powerful\\nin terms of thinking about how play\\ncan be leveraged for plasticity.\\nSo for those of you that are\\ninterested in leveraging play\\nfor neuroplasticity and\\nexpanding your mind,\\nif you will,\\nI highly recommend picking an activity\\nthat will allow you to\\nadopt different roles\\nwithin that activity\\nwhere it\\'s not rigidly linear.\\nThis is actually a way in which\\nI start to depart from\\nthis modern and important,\\nbut somewhat narrow idea.\\nThat exercise is the\\nonly route to plasticity.\\nYes, it\\'s true.\\nI have Nobel Prize winning colleagues\\nthat swim for two miles a day\\nand have done on that for a long time.\\nAnd they will tell you,\\nI always think more\\nclearly after my swimming\\nand I certainly in my\\nexperience after a good run\\nor a good workout, my\\nmind seems to work best.\\nUnless of course, that workout\\nwas very, very intense.\\nI\\'ve talked about this before.\\nIf you do work out very, very hard\\nin whether or not it\\'s aerobic\\nor resistance training\\nor sport of any kind,\\nyou brain won\\'t function\\nas well afterwards,\\nmostly because of the diversion of oxygen\\nto tissues away from your brain,\\nyou actually are getting\\nless oxygen to your brain,\\nbut in general,\\nmost of us feel that if\\nwe exercise regularly,\\nour brain functions better.\\nBut there are activities that\\nextend beyond linear exercise,\\nbeyond just generating\\nthe same sets of movements\\nover and over again,\\nwhen or not it\\'s exercise or not.\\nAnd that\\'s really what play is.\\nPlay is about dynamically\\nexploring different kinds\\nof movements,\\ndynamically exploring\\ndifferent kinds of thoughts,\\ndynamically exploring\\ndifferent kinds of roles\\nthat one could adopt.\\nAnd that is the way that\\nthe brain learns new things.\\nSo I encourage you to explore chess.\\nI intend to learn chess this year.\\nI\\'m very excited to do that.\\nNow, if you already play chess\\nand you are an expert chess player,\\nyou actually will derive less benefit\\nin terms of this play\\ninduced neuroplasticity\\nthan you would, for instance,\\nif you went out,\\nand I don\\'t know, played a game of soccer\\nor did something that was very novel\\nfor your nervous system,\\nbecause in that novelty\\nand in that exploration of new behaviors\\nand new ways of thinking,\\nyou are opening the portal to plasticity,\\nwhereas in doing what you\\nalready know how to do\\nand trying just to perform\\nbetter and better at it,\\nyou will get better at chess,\\nbut again, that\\'s just chess.\\nYou are not expanding the realms\\nin which you can become more plastic,\\nthat you are able to learn new things\\nin relationship,\\nin life, in finance and\\nfriendship, et cetera.\\nIn researching this episode,\\none of the most interesting\\nareas I discovered\\nwas this notion of personal play identity,\\npersonal play identity is a term\\nthat at least to my\\nknowledge was coined by\\na Turkish researcher by the name.\\nAnd forgive me, I\\'m going\\nto mispronounce this\\nis Gökhan Güneş\\nG O K H A N,\\nlast name G U N E S.\\nAnd forgive me Gökhan\\nand if we have any Turkish\\nspeaking members of the audience,\\nplease put the correction in\\nthe comment section on YouTube,\\nmake it fanatic so I can\\nunderstand what it is.\\nPlease I\\'d love to\\ncorrect it and apologies,\\nor who knows if I got it right\\nthen it was pure luck.\\nGökhan Güneş has coined this\\nterm personal play identity,\\nand the key role that\\npersonal play identity\\nestablishes in who we\\nsee ourselves as being,\\nand not just in the context of play.\\nPersonal play identity\\nhas four well defined dimensions.\\nAnd I should say that if you\\'re interested\\nin learning more about this,\\nthe paper that I found\\nparticularly informative\\nis published in Current Psychology\\nand the title is \"Personal play identity\\nand the fundamental elements\\nin its development process.\"\\nAnd the author of course,\\nis Gökhan Güneş G U N E S last name.\\nThis is from 2021.\\nSo recent review.\\nThere are four components\\nto personal play identity,\\nhow you play,\\nyour personality,\\nsocio culture and environment.\\nSo that\\'s the third one that\\'s together,\\nsocio culture environment,\\nand economics and technology.\\nNow that sounds somewhat complex,\\nand this paper is somewhat complex,\\nbut basically what it says is that\\nwe bring together certain\\naspects of ourselves\\nand how we react to\\ndifferent place scenarios\\nwhen we\\'re younger.\\nAnd we bring that forward into the world.\\nIn all context as adults.\\nTo illustrate this,\\nI\\'m going to ask you a question,\\nwhen you were a child,\\nlet\\'s say 10 years old,\\nwould you have considered\\nyourself competitive?\\nWould you have considered yourself\\nsomebody who\\'s cooperative?\\nAnd realize of course\\nthat those are not mutually exclusive,\\nyou could be competitive and cooperative.\\nWould you consider yourself somebody\\nthat preferred to play alone\\nor preferred to play with\\none or two close friends?\\nOr were you somebody that\\nreally enjoyed playing\\nin large groups?\\nHere\\'s a key one.\\nWere you somebody that enjoyed\\nplaying the leader in one moment\\nand was equally okay\\nwith being a follower at a later moment?\\nWere you okay with\\nhaving your role switched\\nmidway through a game?\\nWere you get up upset or be delighted\\nor not care at all about\\nhaving to switch teams\\nduring the middle of game\\nbecause your team was winning right?\\nTo even things out,\\nyou can imagine how that\\nwould play out internally.\\nYou would immediately register\\nthat you must be a valuable player\\nbecause you\\'re being\\nmoved off the winning team\\ntoward the losing team.\\nBut then again,\\nyou\\'re now being forced\\nto join the losing team.\\nHow did you feel about that?\\nWere you somebody that was comfortable\\nwith other people breaking rules\\nor perhaps even yourself breaking rules\\nor bending rules,\\nkind of be able to find term,\\nor were you somebody that\\nreally needed to know all the rules?\\nAnd if everyone didn\\'t\\nrigidly adhere to those rules\\nwas quite disturbed by that?\\nThe number of questions\\ngoes on and on and on.\\nAnd I will provide a link to a paper\\nthat asks a number of questions\\nthat helps you arrive at\\na sort of score of sorts\\nor an index of what Güneş\\nand others have referred\\nto as personal play identity.\\nThe point is that\\nif we look back to our early adolescence,\\nsomewhere between 10 and 14 years old,\\na peak time for social development,\\na peak time for play of various kinds,\\na peak time for motor development,\\na peak time of psychosocial development,\\nwhere we learn where we\\nfit into hierarchies.\\nAs we relate to members of the same sex\\nof the opposite sex, et cetera,\\nwe can start to get a portal into\\nhow and why we show up to\\nvarious activities in work\\nand relationship, et cetera, as adults.\\nIn fact,\\nI\\'ll venture to say that\\nif we go into that process\\nfor ourselves for five or 10 minutes,\\nyou start to see some remarkable parallels\\nbetween the way you were at that stage\\nand your tendencies and\\nyour preferences as adults.\\nWe tend to look at our\\nearly childhood experiences\\nand our families,\\nand to some degree our friends\\nin terms of how we become who we become.\\nI\\'ve talked about the\\nincredible work of Allan Schore\\non previous episodes of the podcast.\\nAllan Schore is a psychiatrist\\nand has done extensive work\\non how parent child\\ninteractions in particular baby\\nand mother,\\nbut also baby and father\\nshaped the brain\\nand the brain and\\nemotional system\\'s ability\\nto go from states of\\nelation and excitement,\\nthe so-called dopamine\\nepinephrine type circuitry\\nto the more warm soothing\\ntypes of calm interactions\\nthat in broad terms could be described\\nas more serotonin oxytocin\\nand things of that sort.\\nThat work really points to the key roles\\nthat the caregiver\\nand the child you\\nengaged in an early life.\\nAnd that is incredible work.\\nI do hope to host Dr.\\nSchore on the podcast\\nat some point in the\\nnot too distant future,\\nbut equally important of course,\\nare the interactions that we export\\nfrom that early laying down\\nof biological circuitry\\nand psychological circuitry,\\nto the way we play by ourselves\\nand the way we play with others\\nin small numbers or in great numbers.\\nAnd of course it would be the case\\nthat how we played as a 10 or 12 year old\\nwould impact how we\\nbehave as a 16 year old\\nand as a 20 year old and as a 30 year old\\nand so on and so on.\\nOne of my favorite things\\nabout developmental biology\\nand developmental psychology\\nis that it is grounded in the fact\\nthat we don\\'t just have a\\nchildhood and an adulthood.\\nThere isn\\'t just our child\\nself and our adult self.\\nAnd even though there\\nare transitions around\\nthe mechanisms that\\nunderline neuroplasticity\\nat approximately age 25,\\nit is simply the case that development\\nis our entire lifespan,\\nthat our lifespan is one\\nlong developmental arc.\\nHow long depends on our\\ngenetics, our lifestyle\\naccidents, injury and disease of course,\\nbut it is one long developmental arc.\\nAnd so it shouldn\\'t surprise us at all\\nthat how we learn to play as\\na 10 year old or 12 year old\\nwould impact how we play\\nand interact with people\\nas a teenager and a young adult\\nand on and on and on.\\nAnd that play is the\\nplace in which we explore\\nin which we learn\\nplay is the substrate\\nby which our nervous system changes us\\nfrom this hyper-connected\\nbatch of neurons,\\nwhere everything is\\nconnected to everything,\\nmore or less\\nto a brain and nervous system whereby\\ncertain circuits work\\nwith immense proficiency\\nand others are less accessible to us.\\nBut again,\\nthe wonderful thing about\\nthe human nervous system\\nis that because it is plastic\\nfor the entire lifespan\\nand because these two\\nelements of focus and rest\\ncan be deployed again\\nand again, and again,\\njust because neural circuits didn\\'t form\\ndoes not mean that they\\ncan\\'t form later in life.\\nAnd today we\\'ve been\\nfocusing on how play itself,\\nthe same substrate that\\nwe use during development\\nto become who we are,\\nis the portal by which\\nwe can change who we are\\nfor the better.\\nSo I hope I\\'ve convinced you\\nthat play is an extremely important\\nfundamental homeostatically regulated\\naspect of our nervous system,\\nwhich is just a mouthful\\nof nerd speak to say,\\nplay can change your brain for the better.\\nAnd that is true for every stage of life.\\nThe recommendation that I make,\\nand certainly the one that\\nI\\'m going to direct it myself\\nas well\\nis to try and engage in at least one hour\\nof pure play per week.\\nNow I came to that recommendation\\nbecause of the literature that says,\\nwell, you need to engage\\nsomething pretty repetitively.\\nIt should be novel.\\nSo this wouldn\\'t be something\\nthat you are exceptionally\\ngood at already.\\nIf you insist on doing something\\nthat you\\'re already exceptionally good at,\\nthen you want to really do some free form,\\nlow stakes tinkering.\\nSo make it safe,\\nbut make it free form.\\nSo really explore things with that.\\nSome people call this beginner\\'s mind.\\nAlthough I find that a little abstract,\\nI like the notion of beginner\\'s mind,\\nbut sort of like,\\nhow do you know if you\\'re\\nin beginner\\'s mind?\\nI think beginner\\'s mind\\nis sort of the expectation\\nthat you\\'re not going to do it well yet,\\nbut play extends beyond beginner\\'s mind.\\nPlay is really about\\nnot even worrying if you\\'re\\ngoing to get good at it\\nor really proficient at it.\\nIt\\'s really about exploring contingencies\\nwith truly low stakes.\\nThat\\'s what will allow you to access\\nthese neurochemical combinations\\nof elevated endogenous opioids,\\nlow epinephrine, et cetera,\\nthat will open up neuroplasticity.\\nFor those of you that need\\na little more guidance\\non how to play.\\nThere\\'s a book out there\\nactually learned about this\\nfrom Tim Ferriss\\' blog,\\nit\\'s called \"Play It Away: A\\nWorkaholic\\'s Cure for Anxiety.\"\\nSo that\\'s more focused on anxiety.\\nThe author is Charlie Hoehn,\\nlast name H O E H N\\nwill provide a link for it in\\nthe show notes and caption,\\n\"Play It Away: A Workaholic\\'s\\nCure for Anxiety.\"\\nBut books and other resources aside,\\nI think one hour of play per week\\nis a reasonable amount of time\\nto engage in dedicated play behavior.\\nFor the purpose of opening\\nup these neural circuits\\nfor plasticity,\\nthe key feature of course,\\nis to not have immense proficiency\\nin that given activity,\\nor at least not the way you perform it.\\nAnd if you do gain\\nproficiency in that activity,\\nwell, then it becomes something else\\nit\\'s no longer about\\nplay it\\'s performance.\\nSo in that case,\\nyou would then want to\\nadopt a new play behavior.\\nYou\\'ll notice that I largely avoided\\nusing the word fun\\nthroughout this episode.\\nFun is a somewhat abstract term\\nand like many emotions and\\nmany verbal descriptions\\nof experience.\\nIt falls short in the context of\\na neurobiologic goal\\ndiscussion about play.\\nIf you have fun, terrific.\\nSome people might find,\\nhowever that engaging in play\\nis kind of uncomfortable.\\nWell there, your goal then\\nshould be to lower your level\\nof discomfort\\nby focusing less on the outcomes\\nand just simply engaging\\nin the behavior because,\\nwell, I\\'m telling you\\nthat it\\'s good for you,\\nbut hopefully you will tell yourself\\nthat it\\'s good for you\\nand that you will experience\\nthat it\\'s good for you.\\nThe literature certainly points to that.\\nAnd the literature certainly\\npoints to the fact that\\nplay is the way that we are built.\\nWe are built to play.\\nWe have brain circuits from back to front\\nand within our body that are there\\nfor play and they don\\'t disappear.\\nThey do not get pruned away\\nas we go from development to adulthood.\\nSo if ever you needed a\\nneurobiological explanation\\nfor why play is important\\nthroughout the lifespan,\\nit\\'s that.\\nIt\\'s that biology does\\nnot waste resources.\\nIt\\'s a extremely efficient.\\nAnd were the circuits for\\nplay not to be important\\nin adulthood.\\nThey would\\'ve been pruned\\naway, but I guarantee you,\\nthey are there in your brain\\nand nervous system now,\\nthey will be there tomorrow\\nand they will be there going forward.\\nSo my suggestion is that you use them.\\nOne hour per week.\\nIf

professor of\\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\\nToday, we are going to\\ndiscuss the gut and the brain,\\nand we are going to discuss how your gut\\ninfluences your brain and your\\nbrain influences your gut.\\nAs many of you probably know,\\nthere is a phenomenon\\ncalled your gut feeling,\\nwhich tends to be something\\nthat you seem to know\\nwithout really knowing how you know it.\\nThat's one version of the gut feeling.\\nThe other is that you sense\\nsomething in your actual gut,\\nin your body, and that somehow drives you\\nto think or feel or act\\nin a particular way,\\nmaybe to move towards something\\nor to move away from something.\\nNow, today, we aren't\\ngoing to focus so much\\non the psychology of gut feelings\\nbut on the biology of gut feelings\\nand how the gut and brain interact.\\nBecause indeed your gut is\\ncommunicating to your brain\\nboth directly by way of\\nneurons, nerve cells,\\nand indirectly by changing\\nthe chemistry of your body,\\nwhich permeates up to your brain\\nand impacts various\\naspects of brain function.\\nBut it works in the other direction, too.\\nYour brain is influencing your entire gut.\\nAnd when I say entire gut, I\\ndon't just mean your stomach,\\nI mean, your entire digestive tract.\\nYour brain is impacting things\\nlike how quickly your food is digesting,\\nthe chemistry of your gut,\\nif you happen to be\\nstressed or not stressed.\\nWhether or not you are under\\na particular social challenge\\nor whether or not you're\\nparticularly happy\\nwill in fact adjust the\\nchemistry of your gut\\nand the chemistry of your gut in turn\\nwill change the way that your brain works.\\nI'll put all that together for you\\nin the context of what we\\ncall the gut microbiome.\\nThe gut microbiome are the\\ntrillions of little bacteria\\nthat live all the way\\nalong your digestive tract\\nand that strongly impact the\\nway that your entire body works\\nat the level of metabolism,\\nimmune system, and brain function.\\nAnd of course, we will discuss to tools,\\nthings that you can do\\nin order to maintain\\nor improve your gut health.\\nBecause as you'll also soon see,\\ngut health is immensely important\\nfor all aspects of our wellbeing\\nat the level of our brain,\\nat the level of our body,\\nAnd there are simple, actionable\\nthings that we can all do\\nin order to optimize our gut health\\nin ways that optimize\\nour overall nervous system functioning.\\nSo we will be sure to review those today.\\nThis episode also serves\\nas a bit of a primer\\nfor our guest episode\\nthat's coming up next week\\nwith Dr. Justin Sonnenburg\\nfrom Stanford University.\\nDr. Sonnenburg is a world\\nexpert in the gut microbiome\\nand so we will dive really\\ndeep into the gut microbiome\\nin all its complexity.\\nWe'll make it all very simple for you.\\nWe will also talk about\\nactionable tools in that episode.\\nThis episode is a standalone episode,\\nso you'll get a lot of\\ninformation and tools,\\nbut if you have the opportunity\\nto see this episode first,\\nI think it will serve as a nice\\nprimer for the conversation\\nwith Dr. Sonnenburg.\\nBefore we begin,\\nI'd like to emphasize that this podcast\\nis separate from my teaching\\nand research roles at Stanford.\\nIt is however, part of\\nmy desire and effort\\nto bring zero cost to consumer information\\nabout science and science-related tools\\nto the general public.\\nIn keeping with that theme,\\nI'd like to thank the\\nsponsors of today's podcast.\\nOur first sponsor is Athletic Greens.\\nAthletic Greens is an all-in-one\\nvitamin mineral probiotic drink.\\nI've been using Athletic Greens,\\nwhich is now called AG1, since 2012\\nso I'm delighted that they're\\nsponsoring the podcast.\\nThe reason I started\\ntaking Athletic Greens\\nand the reason I still\\ntake Athletic Greens\\nonce or twice a day\\nis that it covers\\nall of my foundational\\nvitamin and mineral needs\\nand also because it contains\\nhigh quality probiotics and prebiotics,\\nwhich is a topic that we're\\ngoing to talk a lot about today.\\nWith Athletic Greens, I can\\nbe sure that I'm getting\\nall the vitamins and minerals that I need.\\nSo if I'm missing anything in my diet,\\nI can compensate for that\\nwith the Athletic Greens.\\nPlus it has the probiotics and prebiotics\\nthat can also compensate\\nfor any deficiencies\\nthat I might have in creating\\nthe right environment\\nfor my gut microbiome.\\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\\nto claim a special offer.\\nThey'll give you five free travel packs,\\nwhich make it very easy\\nto mix up Athletic Greens\\nwhile you're in the car or on a plane\\nor otherwise on the move,\\nand they'll give year's\\nsupply of vitamin D3 K2.\\nWhile not everyone needs\\nadditional vitamin D3,\\nmany people do even if they're\\ngetting sufficient sunlight.\\nSo you get the year's\\nsupply of vitamin D3,\\nand it also has K2 in there.\\nK2 has been shown to be important\\nfor various aspects of calcium regulation,\\ncardiovascular health, and so on.\\nAgain, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\\nto claim this special offer.\\nToday's episode is also\\nbrought to us by LMNT.\\nLMNT is an electrolyte drink\\nthat contains no sugar.\\nIt does however contain sodium,\\nmagnesium, and potassium.\\nI've talked about sodium\\non the podcast before.\\nI think sodium can indeed be\\nproblematic for some people\\nwith hypertension or pre-hypertension,\\nbut for many people,\\nsodium is a great thing.\\nIt can increase blood volume\\nin ways that can be helpful to them.\\nIt can improve nerve cell function in ways\\nthat can be helpful to them,\\nand for me, anytime I'm\\nexercising and sweating a lot,\\nI want to replace my electrolytes\\nand that means replacing sodium\\nfor adequate neuron function,\\nmuscle function, and so on.\\nLMNT is formulated to help anyone\\nwith their electrolyte needs\\nand is perfectly suited for people\\nwho are following a\\nketogenic, low carbohydrate,\\nor paleo diet.\\nLMNT contains a science-backed\\nelectrolyte ratio\\nof 1000 milligrams of sodium,\\n200 milligrams of potassium,\\nand 60 milligrams of magnesium.\\nIf you'd like to try LMNT,\\nyou can go to drinklmnt.com/huberman\\nto claim a free LMNT sample pack.\\nYou only pay the cost of shipping.\\nAgain, that's drinklmnt.com/huberman\\nto claim a free sample pack.\\nToday's podcast is also\\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\\nInsideTracker is a\\npersonalized nutrition platform\\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\\nto help you better understand your body\\nand help you reach your health goals.\\nI've long been a believer in\\ngetting regular blood work done\\nfor the simple reason that\\nmany of the things that impact\\nyour immediate and long-term\\nhealth can only be assessed\\nwith a quality blood test.\\nAnd nowadays with the\\nadvent of modern DNA tests,\\nyou can also get insights\\ninto, for instance,\\nwhat your biological age\\nis and how that compares\\nto your chronological age.\\nNow, one of the major problems\\nwith a lot of blood tests\\nand DNA tests out there is\\nthat you get numbers back,\\nthey'll tell you if those\\nnumbers are in range\\nand out of range\\nbut they don't tell you\\nanything about what to do\\nwith that information.\\nWith InsideTracker, they\\nmake everything very simple\\nin terms of directing you\\ntowards particular protocols.\\nSo these could be nutrition protocols,\\nsupplementation protocols, or\\nlifestyle behavioral protocols\\nto help you bring those numbers\\ninto the ranges that are best for you.\\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\\nyou can visit insidetracker.com/huberman\\nto get 20% off any of\\nInsideTracker's plans.\\nThat's insidetracker.com/huberman\\nto get 20% off.\\nOkay, let's talk about\\nthe gut and the brain\\nand how your gut and your brain\\ncommunicate in both directions.\\nBecause as I mentioned before,\\nyour gut is communicating all the time\\nwith your brain and your brain\\nis communicating all the time\\nwith your gut.\\nAnd so the two are in this\\nongoing dance with one another,\\nthat ordinarily is below\\nyour conscious detection\\nalthough you're probably\\nfamiliar with the experience\\nof every once in a while\\ngetting a stomach ache\\nor of eating something that\\ndoesn't agree with you,\\nor conversely eating something\\nthat you find particularly delicious\\nand that sensation or\\nthat experience rather\\nbeing a whole body experience.\\nYour mind is excited about\\nwhat you're eating or just ate,\\nyour gut is excited about what\\nyou're eating or just ate,\\nand it seems to be a kind\\nof unified perception\\nof both brain and body.\\nToday, we're going to talk\\nabout how that comes about\\nin the negative sense.\\nLike, you know, when you meet\\nsomeone you really dislike\\nor when you have a stomach ache,\\nand in the positive sense,\\nwhen you interact with somebody\\nthat you really, really like\\nand you'd like to spend more\\ntime with them, for instance,\\nor when you eat something\\nthat you really, really like\\nand you'd like to spend\\nmore time with that food,\\nso to speak.\\nNow, the gut and the brain\\nrepresent what we call\\na biological circuit,\\nmeaning they include different stations.\\nSo station A communicates with station B,\\nwhich communicates with\\nstation C, and so on.\\nAnd as I mentioned earlier,\\nit is bidirectional.\\nIt's a two-way street\\nbetween gut and brain.\\nI want to make the important\\npoint at the outset\\nthat when I say the word gut,\\nwhen I refer to the gut,\\nI am not just referring to the stomach.\\nMost of us think that the\\ngut equates to the stomach\\nbecause we think of having\\na gut or not having a gut\\nor having a gut feeling of some sort.\\nBut in the context of gut-brain signaling\\nand the related microbiome,\\nthe gut includes the\\nentire digestive tract.\\nThat's right, from start to finish\\nthe entire digestive tract\\nso much so that today\\nwe're going to talk about,\\nfor instance, the presence\\nof neurons, nerve cells,\\nthat reside in your gut\\nthat communicate to specific\\nlocations in the brain\\nand cause the release of\\nspecific neurochemicals,\\nsuch as the neurochemical\\ndopamine or serotonin,\\nthat can motivate you to seek\\nmore of a particular food\\nor type of interaction or behavior,\\nor to avoid particular foods,\\ninteractions, and behaviors.\\nAnd some of those neurons,\\nmany of those neurons, in fact,\\nreside in your intestines,\\nnot in your stomach.\\nThey can be in the small\\nintestine or the large intestine.\\nIn fact, you actually have\\ntaste receptors and neurons\\nlocated all along your digestive tract.\\nYou have neurons that are located\\nall along your digestive tract\\nand they are communicating to your brain\\nto impact what you think, what\\nyou feel, and what you do.\\nOkay, so for the gut-brain axis,\\nwe need to deal with the brain part\\nand then we need to\\ndeal with the gut part.\\nLet's just quickly talk\\nabout the brain part\\nbecause there the word brain\\nis also a bit of a misnomer\\nin that when we say the gut-brain axis,\\nit does include the brain\\nbut includes a lot of\\nother things as well.\\nSo as many of you probably know by now,\\nif you're listeners of this podcast,\\nand if you don't, that's fine,\\nyour nervous system includes your brain\\nand your spinal cord\\nand those together constitute\\nwhat's called the central nervous system.\\nYour neural retinas,\\nwhich are lining the back of your eyes\\nand are the light sensing\\nportion of your eyes\\nare also part of your\\ncentral nervous system.\\nSo actually your eyes\\nare part of your brain.\\nThey're the only parts of your brain\\nthat are outside the cranial vault.\\nSo your retinas, your brain proper,\\nand your spinal cord make up\\nthe central nervous system.\\nThe other parts of your\\nnervous system constitute\\nwhat's called the\\nperipheral nervous system,\\nwhich are the components\\nof your nervous system\\nthat reside outside the\\nretinas, brain, and spinal cord.\\nNow, this is very important\\nbecause today we're going to talk a lot\\nabout how the gut\\ncommunicates with the brain.\\nAnd it does that by way\\nof peripheral nervous system components,\\nmeaning nerve cells that reside in the gut\\nand elsewhere in the body\\nthat communicate to the brain\\nand cross into the central nervous system\\nto influence what you think\\nand what you feel, okay?\\nSo that's the nervous\\nsystem part of what we call\\nthe gut-brain axis,\\nbrain, again, just being a shorthand\\nfor including all the\\nelements I just described.\\nGut, as you now know,\\nincludes all the elements\\nof the digestive tract.\\nLet's talk about the\\narchitecture or the structure\\nof the gut of your digestive system.\\nNow, not surprisingly\\nyour digestive system,\\naka your gut, begins at your\\nmouth and ends at your anus.\\nAnd all along its length,\\nthere are a series of sphincters\\nthat cut off certain chambers\\nof the digestive tract\\nfrom the other chambers.\\nNow, also along this tube that\\nwe call the digestive tract,\\nthere's great variation\\nin the degree of acidity,\\nor pH as it's sometimes called.\\nThat variation in acidity\\nturns out to give rise\\nto different little microenvironments\\nin which particular\\nmicrobiota, microbacteria,\\ncan thrive or fail to thrive.\\nAnd so the way I'd like you to think\\nabout the digestive tract,\\nthis gut component of the gut-brain axis,\\nis that it's not just one component.\\nIt's not just your stomach\\nwith a particular acidity\\nand a bunch of microorganisms\\nthat work particularly well\\nto make you feel good\\nand make your digestive\\npathways work well.\\nIt's a series of chambers,\\nlittle microenvironments,\\nin which particular microbiota thrive\\nand other microbiota do not.\\nAnd certain behaviors that you undertake\\nand certain experiences that you have\\nwill adjust those\\nmicroenvironments in ways\\nthat make particular\\nmicrobiota, certain bacteria,\\nmore likely to thrive and\\nothers less likely to thrive.\\nWe'll talk about how that was\\nset up for you early in life.\\nActually from the moment\\nthat you came into the world,\\nthat microbiome was being established.\\nIt was actually strongly impacted\\ndepending on whether or not\\nyou were born by C-section\\nor by vaginal birth.\\nAnd it was strongly\\nimpacted by who handled you\\nwhen you came into the world,\\nliterally the hands that were on you.\\nHow much skin contact you had,\\nwhether or not you were\\na preemie baby or not,\\nwhether or not you had pets at home,\\nwhether or not you were\\nallowed to play in the dirt,\\nwhether or not you were\\nallowed to eat snails\\nor whether or not you were kept\\nin a very antiseptic environment.\\nAll of those experiences\\nshaped these little microenvironments\\nand shaped what constitutes best or worst\\nfor those microenvironments, okay?\\nSo you have this long tube that\\nwe call the digestive tract\\nand it's very, very long.\\nIn fact, if we were to splay it out,\\nwe were to take all the curves and turns\\nout of the intestine, we would\\nfind that it is very long.\\nIt's approximately nine meters long.\\nNow, the structure of that digestive tract\\nturns out to be very important\\nin terms of gut-brain signaling.\\nOnce again, it's a tube\\nand the hollow of that tube\\nis called the lumen, L-U-M-E-N.\\nBut the walls of the tube\\nare not necessarily smooth,\\nat least not for significant portions\\nof the digestive tract.\\nFor much of the digestive tract,\\nthere are bumps and\\ngrooves that look very much\\nlike the folds in the brain,\\nbut these bumps and grooves\\nare made up of other tissues.\\nThey're made up of what's\\ncalled a mucosal lining,\\nso there's a lot of mucus there.\\nAnd if we were to look really closely,\\nwhat we'd find is that there are\\nlittle hairy-like cellular processes\\nthat we call microvilli\\nthat are able to push things\\nalong the digestive tract.\\nThe microbiota reside\\neverywhere along the lumen\\nof the digestive tract,\\nstarting at the mouth and\\nall the way to the other end.\\nAnd they reside within those microvilli\\nand they reside within the lumen.\\nAnd if we were to look really closely\\nat the bumps and grooves\\nalong the digestive tract,\\nwhat we would find is that\\nthere are little niches,\\nlittle areas in which particular things\\ncan grow and reside best.\\nNow, that might sound kind of gross,\\nbut it actually is a good thing,\\nespecially what's growing\\nand residing there\\nare microbacterial organisms\\nthat are good for your gut\\nand that signal good things to your brain.\\nAnd we will talk about what\\nthat signaling looks like\\nand how that's done and\\naccomplished in just a few moments.\\nBut I want you to get a clear\\nmental picture of your gut,\\nsomething that we don't often see.\\nAnd often when we think about the gut,\\nagain, we just think about\\nthe hollow of the stomach,\\nfood going in there, and getting digested,\\nbut it's far more complex\\nand actually far more\\ninteresting than that.\\nNow, I've been referring\\nto the gut microbiome\\nand to the microbiota and these bacteria.\\nLet me define those terms a\\nlittle bit more specifically\\njust to avoid any confusion.\\nThe microbiota are the actual bacteria.\\nThe microbiome is used\\nto refer to the bacteria\\nbut also all the genes as bacteria make,\\nbecause it turns out that\\nthey make some important genes\\nthat actually impact all of us.\\nYou have loads and loads\\nof these little\\nmicrobiota, these bacteria.\\nIn fact, right now you\\nare carrying with you\\nabout two to three kilograms,\\nso that's more than six pounds,\\nof these microbiota, these bacteria.\\nAnd if we were to look at\\nthem under a microscope,\\nwhat we would see\\nis these are relatively\\nsimple little organisms.\\nSome remain stationary\\nso they might plop down\\ninto the mucosal lining\\nor they might hang out on\\na particular microvilli\\nor they might be in one\\nof those little niches,\\nand others can move about,\\nbut they basically fill the entire lumen.\\nThey surround and kind of coat the surface\\nof the microvilli and they're tucked up\\ninto any of those little niches\\nthat are available to them\\nto tuck into.\\nIf you were to take the head of a pin\\nand look at it under the microscope,\\nyou could fit many, many hundreds,\\nif not thousands or more of\\nthese little microbacteria.\\nAnd the reason I say many,\\nmany thousands or more,\\nI'm giving a kind of broad range there,\\nis that they do vary in size\\nand, again, they vary as to\\nwhether or not they can move\\nor they don't move.\\nNow, they're constantly\\nturning over in your gut,\\nmeaning they're being born so to speak\\nand they're dying off.\\nAnd some will stay there\\nfor very long periods\\nof time within your gut\\nand others will get excreted.\\nAbout 60% of your stool,\\nas unpleasant as that\\nmight be to think about,\\nis made up of live and dead microbacteria.\\nSo you're constantly making\\nand excreting these microbacteria.\\nAnd which microbacteria you make\\nand how many stay inside\\nyour gut and how many leave,\\nmeaning how many are excreted,\\ndepends a lot on the chemistry of your gut\\nand depends very strongly\\non the foods that you eat\\nand the foods that you do not eat.\\nNow, just because what we\\neat strongly influences\\nour microbiome, meaning our microbacteria,\\ndoes not mean that there\\nare not other influences\\non what constitutes our microbiome.\\nOur microbiome is also\\nmade up by microbacteria\\nthat access our digestive\\ntract through our mouth,\\nthrough breathing, through kissing,\\nand through skin contact.\\nIn fact, one of the major\\ndeterminants of our microbiome\\nis who we interact with\\nand the environment\\nthat we happen to be in.\\nAnd that actually includes whether or not\\nwe interact with animals.\\nIn a little bit, I'll talk about some data\\nas to whether or not you grew\\nup in a home that had animals,\\nwhether or not you grew up in the home,\\nwhether or not there was\\na lot of social contact,\\nmeaning skin contact,\\nor whether or not you grew up\\nin a more animal sparse,\\ncontact sparse environment\\nand how that shapes your microbiome.\\nBut the simple point is that what you eat\\ninfluences your microbiome,\\nbut also what you do,\\nwhat you think, and what you feel,\\nand many of the low microbacteria\\nthat get into your digestive tract\\ndo so by way of social interactions.\\nIn fact, if you ask a neurobiologist\\nwhat the role of the microbiome is,\\nthey'll tell you almost certainly\\nthat it's there to impact brain function.\\nBut if you have friends\\nthat are microbiologists,\\nsuch as I do, they'll tell you,\\nwell, maybe the brain and\\nnervous system are there\\nto support the microbiome.\\nIt's the other way around.\\nYou have all these little microorganisms\\nthat are taking residence in our body.\\nThey don't really know what\\nthey're doing as far as we know.\\nWe don't know that they have\\nconsciousness or they don't.\\nWe can't rule that out, but\\nit seems pretty unlikely.\\nNonetheless, they are taking advantage\\nof the different environments\\nall along your digestive tract.\\nThey are taking advantage\\nof the sorts of social interactions,\\nfor instance, the people you talk to\\nand that breathe on you,\\nthe people that you shake hands with,\\nthe people that you kiss or don't kiss,\\nthe people that you happen to be\\nromantically involved with or not,\\nyour dog, your cat, your lizard, your rat,\\nwhatever pet you happen to own\\nis impacting your microbiome.\\nThere's absolutely no question about that.\\nSo hopefully now you have\\nsome sense of the architecture\\nof the digestive pathway\\nand you have some sense of the trillions\\nof little microbacteria that are living\\nall along the different components\\nof that digestive pathway.\\nBut what we haven't talked about yet,\\nand what I'd like to talk about now,\\nis what those little\\nmicrobiota are actually doing\\nin your digestive tract.\\nIn addition to just living there\\nfor their own intents and purposes,\\nthey are contributing, for\\ninstance, to your digestion.\\nMany of the genes that\\nthose microbiota make\\nare genes that are\\ninvolved in fermentation\\nand genes that are involved in digestion\\nof particular types of nutrients.\\nAnd in a little bit, we will talk\\nabout how what you eat can\\nactually change the enzymes\\nthat those microbiome components make,\\nenzymes largely being things\\nthat are responsible for digestion.\\nThey catalyze other\\nsorts of cellular events\\nbut in the context of\\nthe digestive pathway,\\nwe're talking about enzymes\\nthat help digest your food.\\nSo those microbiota are indeed\\nhelping you in many ways.\\nAnd if you lack certain microbiota\\nthat can help you digest,\\nit stands to reason that\\nyou would have challenges\\ndigesting certain types of foods.\\nThe other amazing thing\\nthat these microbiota do\\nis they change the way\\nthat your brain functions\\nby way of metabolizing or facilitating\\nthe metabolism of particular\\nneurotransmitters.\\nSo one of the ways that having\\ncertain microbiota present\\nin your gut can improve your\\nmood or degrade your mood,\\nfor instance, is by way\\nof certain microbiota\\nbeing converted into or\\nfacilitating the conversion\\nof chemicals, such as GABA.\\nGABA is what we call an\\ninhibitory neurotransmitter.\\nIt's involved in suppressing the action\\nof other neurons.\\nAnd that might sound like a bad thing,\\nbut all types of sedatives, for instance,\\nalcohol, and a lot of neurons\\nthat naturally make GABA\\ncan help quiet certain\\ncircuits in the brain,\\nfor instance, circuits\\nresponsible for anxiety.\\nIn people who have epilepsy,\\nthe GABAergic neurons, as they're called,\\ncan all often be disrupted\\nin their signaling,\\nmeaning they're not\\ncranking out as much GABA\\nand therefore the excitatory neurons,\\nwhich typically release other\\nmolecules like glutamate\\ncan engage in what's\\ncalled runaway excitation\\nand that can give rise to seizures.\\nSo the simple message here\\nis that the microbiota\\nby way of making neurochemicals\\ncan influence the way\\nthat your brain functions.\\nSo you want to support those microbiota\\nand we will give you tools\\nto support those microbiota.\\nBut the takeaway at this point\\nis that those microbiota\\nare making things locally\\nto help digest food.\\nOther microbiota are helping to make\\ncertain neurotransmitters like GABA,\\nand we'll also talk about\\ndopamine and serotonin.\\nAnd so the very specific\\nmicrobiota that reside in your gut\\nhave a profound influence\\non many, many biological functions,\\nespecially immune system function,\\nbrain function, and digestion.\\nSo that should give you\\na fairly complete picture\\nof your gut microbiome.\\nNow I'd like to talk\\nabout how your microbiome\\nand your brain communicate,\\nor more accurately, how your microbiome\\nand the rest of your\\nnervous system communicate.\\nNeurons, which simply means nerve cells,\\nare the cells that do\\nmost of the heavy lifting\\nin your nervous system.\\nThere are of course other\\ncell types that are important.\\nGlial cell, for instance, very,\\nvery important cell types.\\nYou have endothelial cells,\\nwhich are responsible for blood flow,\\npericytes and other types of cells,\\nbut the neurons are really\\ndoing most of the heavy lifting\\nfor most of the things we think about\\nin terms of nervous system function.\\nYou have neurons in your gut\\nand that should not surprise you.\\nNeurons reside in your brain,\\nyour spinal cord, your eyes,\\nin fact, all over your body,\\nand you've got them on your\\nheart and in your heart,\\nand you've got them in your lungs,\\nand you've got them in your spleen,\\nand they connect to all\\nthe different organs\\nand tissues of your body.\\nSo that's not surprising that\\nyou have neurons in your gut.\\nWhat is surprising, however,\\nis the presence of\\nparticular types of neurons\\nthat reside near or in the mucosal lining\\njust next to that lumen of the gut\\nand that are paying attention,\\nand I'll explain what I\\nmean by paying attention,\\nto the components of the\\ngut, both the nutrients\\nand the microbiota,\\nand thereby can send signals\\nup to the brain by way of a long wire\\nthat we call an axon, and can communicate\\nwhat the chemistry and what\\nthe nutritional quality\\nand what the other aspects of\\nthe environment are at the gut\\nat a given location up to the brain\\nin ways that can influence\\nthe brain to, for instance,\\nseek out more of a particular food.\\nLet me give you a sort of\\naction-based picture of this.\\nLet's say like most people,\\nyou enjoy sweet foods.\\nI don't particularly enjoy sweet foods\\nbut there are a few that I like.\\nI'm a sucker for a really\\ngood dark chocolate\\nor really good ice cream\\nor I got this thing for donuts\\nthat seems to just not quit\\nalthough I don't tend to\\nindulge it very often,\\nI do like them.\\nIf I eat that particular food,\\nobviously digestion starts in the mouth.\\nThere are enzymes there,\\nit gets chewed up,\\nthe food goes down into the gut.\\nThese neurons are activated,\\nmeaning that causes the neurons\\nto be electrically active\\nwhen particular components,\\ncertain nutrients in\\nthose foods are present.\\nAnd for the cell types,\\nor I should say the neuron\\ntypes that matter here,\\nthe nutrients that really\\ntrigger their activation\\nare sugar, fatty acids,\\nand amino acids.\\nNow, these particular neurons\\nhave the name enteroendocrine cells\\nbut more recently they've been\\ndefined as neuropod cells.\\nNeuropod cells were discovered\\nby Diego Bohorquez's\\nlab at Duke University.\\nThis is a phenomenal set of discoveries\\nmade mostly in the last 10 years.\\nThese neuropod cells, as I mentioned,\\nare activated by sugar,\\nfatty acids, or amino acids,\\nbut have a particularly\\nstrong activation to sugars.\\nThey do seem to be part of\\nthe sweet sensing system.\\nAnd even though I'm focusing\\non this particular example,\\nthey represent a really nice example\\nof how a particular set\\nof neuro cells in our gut\\nis collecting information\\nabout what is there\\nat a particular location in the gut,\\nand sending that\\ninformation up to our brain.\\nNow, they do that by\\nway of a nerve pathway\\ncalled the vagus nerve.\\nThe vagus nerve is part of\\nthe peripheral nervous system.\\nAnd the vagus nerve is a\\nlittle bit complex to describe\\nif you're just listening to this.\\nIf you are watching this,\\nI'll try and use my hands as a diagram\\nbut really the best thing to do\\nif you want really want\\nto learn neuroanatomy\\nis to just imagine it in\\nyour mind as best you can\\nand if you can track down\\na picture of it, terrific,\\nbut here's how it works.\\nNeurons have a cell body\\nthat we call a soma,\\nthat's where all the DNA are contained.\\nThat's where a lot of\\nthe operating machinery\\nof the cells are contained\\nand a lot of the\\ninstructions for that cell\\nof what to be and how to\\noperate are contained.\\nThe cell bodies of these\\nneurons or the relevant neurons\\nare actually up near the neck.\\nSo you can think of them\\nas a clump of grapes,\\n'cause cell bodies tend\\nto be round or oval-ish.\\nAnd then they send a\\nprocess that we call an axon\\nin one direction out to the gut\\nand they'll send another\\nprocess up into the brain.\\nAnd that little cluster near the neck\\nthat's relevant here is called\\nthe nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E.\\nThe nodose ganglion is a\\nlittle cluster of neurons\\non either side of the neck.\\nIt has a process that goes out to the gut\\nand a process that goes up into the brain.\\nAnd again, these are just one component\\nof the so-called vagus nerve.\\nThe vagus nerve has many, many branches,\\nnot just to the gut.\\nThere are also branches to the liver,\\nbranches to the lungs,\\nbranches to the heart,\\nbranches to the larynx,\\nand even to the spleen,\\nand other areas of the\\nbody that are important.\\nBut right now we're just\\nconcentrating on the neurons\\nthat are in the gut that\\nsignal up to the brain.\\nAnd what the Bohorquez lab has shown\\nis that these neuropod\\ncells are part of network.\\nThey're sensing several\\ndifferent nutrients,\\nbut in particular, when they sense sugar,\\nthey send signals in the\\nform of electrical firing\\nup to the brain in ways\\nthat trigger activation\\nof other brain stations that\\ncause you to seek out more\\nof that particular food.\\nNow, this brings us to\\nsome classic experiments\\nthat at least to me are incredible.\\nAnd these are highly reproducible findings\\nshowing, for instance,\\nthat even if you bypass taste\\nby infusing sweet liquid\\nor putting sweet foods into the gut,\\nand people can never taste\\nthem with their mouth,\\npeople will seek out more\\nof that particular food.\\nAnd if you give them the option\\nto have a sweet food\\ninfused into their gut\\nor a bitter food infused into their gut\\nor a sweet versus sour,\\nor a more sweet versus less sweet food,\\npeople have a selective\\npreference for sweet foods\\neven if they can't taste them.\\nNow, this is important to understand\\nin the context of gut-brain signaling\\nbecause we always think\\nthat we like sweet foods\\nbecause of the way they taste.\\nAnd indeed that's still true,\\nbut much of what we consider\\nthe great taste of a sweet food\\nalso has to do with a gut sensation\\nthat is below our conscious detection.\\nHow do we know that?\\nWell, the Bohorquez lab\\nhas performed experiments\\nusing modern methods and\\nthey're classic experiments\\nshowing that animals and humans\\nwill actively seek out more\\nof a particular sweet food\\neven if it bypasses this taste system.\\nAnd the reverse is also true.\\nThere have been experiments\\ndone in animals and in humans\\nthat have allowed animals or humans\\nto select and eat sweet foods,\\nand indeed that's what they do\\nif they're given the option.\\nAnd yet to somehow eliminate\\nthe activation of these neurons\\nwithin the gut that can sense sweet foods.\\nNow, there are a couple different ways\\nthat those experiments ave been done.\\nIn classic experiments\\nthat date back to the '80s,\\nthis was done by what's called\\nsubdiaphragmatic vagotomy.\\nSo this means cutting off\\nthe branch of the vagus\\nthat enervates the gut below the diaphragm\\nso that the other organs\\ncan still function\\nbecause the vagus is very important,\\nbut basically cutting off\\nthe sweet sensing in the gut,\\nstill giving people the\\nopportunity to taste sweet foods\\nwith their mouth,\\nand they don't actively seek out\\nquite as much of the sweet food\\nwhen they don't have this\\ngut sensing mechanism\\nthat we now know to be dependent\\non these neuropod cells.\\nMore recent experiments\\ninvolve selective silencing\\nof these neuropod cells.\\nAnd there have been a lot\\nof different derivations\\nof this sort of thing,\\nbut the takeaway from it\\nis that our experience of\\nand our desire for particular foods\\nhas everything to do with\\nhow those foods taste.\\nIt also has to do, as you probably know,\\nwith their texture and the\\nsensation of those foods\\nin our mouth, and even indeed\\nhow they go down our throat\\nsometimes can be very\\npleasing or very unpleasant.\\nAnd it also has to do with\\nthis subconscious processing\\nof taste that occurs in the gut itself.\\nAnd again, when I say gut, I\\ndon't just mean in the stomach.\\nThere are actually\\nneurons, neuropod cells,\\nfurther down your digestive tract\\nwhich are signaling to your brain\\nabout the presence of sweet foods,\\nas well as foods such\\nas amino acid rich foods\\nor foods that are rich in\\nparticular types of fatty acids\\nsignaling up to your brain\\nand causing you to seek\\nout more of those foods\\nor to consume more of those foods.\\nNow, you're probably\\nasking, what is the signal?\\nHow does it actually make\\nme want more of those foods\\nwithout me realizing it?\\nWell, it does that by\\nadjusting the release\\nof particular neuromodulators.\\nFor those of you that are not\\nfamiliar with neuromodulators,\\nthese are similar to neurotransmitters,\\nbut they tend to act more broadly.\\nThey tend to impact many\\nmore neurons all at once\\nand they go by names\\nlike dopamine, serotonin,\\nacetylcholine, epinephrine, and so forth.\\nSometimes people refer to\\nthose as neurotransmitters.\\nTechnically they are neuromodulators.\\nI'll refer to them almost\\nalways as neuromodulators.\\nThe neuropod cells signal by way\\nof a particular branch of the vagus\\nthrough that nodose ganglion\\nthat we talked about before\\nand through a number of different stations\\nin the brain stem,\\neventually cause the release\\nof the neuromodulator dopamine.\\nDopamine is often associated\\nwith a sense of pleasure and reward\\nbut it is more appropriately\\nthought of as a neuromodulator\\nthat impacts motivation,\\ncraving, and pursuit.\\nIt tends to put us into modes of action,\\nnot necessarily running\\nand moving through space,\\nalthough it can do that too,\\nbut in the context of feeding,\\nit tends to make us look around more,\\nchew more, reach for things more,\\nand seek out more of whatever it is\\nthat's giving us that sensation\\nof delight or satisfaction.\\nAnd again, that sense of\\ndelight and satisfaction,\\nyou might experience only consciously\\nas the way that something\\ntastes on your mouth\\nbut it actually is caused again\\nby both the sensations in your mouth\\nbut also by the activation\\nof these neuropod cells.\\nSo this is an incredible\\nsystem of gut-brain signaling,\\nand it is but one system\\nof gut-brain signaling.\\nIt turns out it's the system\\nthat we know the most about\\nat this point in time.\\nThere are other components\\nof gut-brain signaling\\nthat we'll talk about in\\na moment, for instance,\\nthe serotonin system.\\nBut in terms of examples\\nof gut-brain signaling\\nfor which we know a lot\\nof the individual elements\\nand how they work,\\nI think this neuropod, neuron\\nsensing of sweet foods,\\nfatty acids, and amino acids in the gut\\nand communicating that up to the brain\\nby way of the vagus and causing us\\nto seek out more of the foods\\nthat deliver those nutrients\\nis an incredible pathway\\nthat really delineates\\nthe beauty and the power\\nof this gut-brain axis.\\nLet me talk about timescales.\\nHere I'm talking about a\\nparticular type of neuron\\nthat is signaling up to the\\nbrain using electrical signals\\nto cause us to want to seek out\\na particular category of foods.\\nThat's happening relatively fast\\ncompared to the hormone\\npathways of the gut\\nwhich also involve neurons.\\nSo your gut is also\\ncommunicating to your brain\\nby way of neurons, nerve cells.\\nBut some of those nerve\\ncells also release hormones.\\nAnd those hormones go by names like CCK,\\nglucagon-like peptide 1, PYY, et cetera.\\nA good example of a hormone pathway,\\nor what's sometimes called\\na hormone peptide pathway,\\nthat is similar to the pathway\\nI've talked about before\\nbut a little bit slower\\nis the ghrelin pathway.\\nGhrelin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N,\\nincreases with fasting.\\nSo the longer it's been\\nsince you've eaten,\\nor if you're just eating very little food\\ncompared to your caloric needs,\\nghrelin levels are going to\\ngo up in your bloodstream\\nand they go up because of processes\\nthat include processes within the gut\\nand include the nervous system.\\nSo it's a slow pathway driving you\\nto seek out food generally.\\nAs far as we know, the\\nghrelin system is not partial\\nto seeking out of sweet foods\\nor fatty foods or so on.\\nGhrelin increases the longer it's been\\nsince you've eaten sufficient calories\\nand it stimulates a feeling of\\nyou wanting to seek out food.\\nWell, how does it do that?\\nIt does that again by\\nimpacting neural circuits\\nwithin the brain, neural\\ncircuits that include\\nwhat we call the brain\\nstem autonomic center.\\nSo it tends to make you feel alert\\nand quite, we say, high\\nlevels of autonomic arousal.\\nIf you haven't eaten in a while,\\nyou might think that you just\\nget really exhausted, right?\\nBecause we all hear that food is energy\\nand caloric energy is\\nwhat we need to burn,\\nbut you actually have a lot\\nof energy stored in your body\\nthat you would be able to use\\nif you really needed energy.\\nBut typically if we\\nhaven't eaten in a while,\\nwe start to get agitated\\nand we get agitated by way way of release\\nof the neuromodulator epinephrine,\\nwhich causes us to look\\naround more, move around more,\\nand seek out food.\\nThat all occurs in brain\\nstem autonomic centers\\nand in the hypothalamus.\\nWe did an entire episode\\non feeding behavior\\nand metabolism as well\\nand you can find those\\nepisodes at hubermanlab.com\\nso I don't want to go into a lot of detail\\nabout hypothalamic and\\nbrains stem centers.\\nBut there's a particular area of the brain\\ncalled the nucleus of the solitary tract,\\nthe NST as it's called,\\nthat's very strongly impacted\\nby these circulating hormones\\nand tends to drive us\\ntoward feeding behavior.\\nSo the important point here\\nis that we have a fast system\\nthat is paying attention\\nto the nutrients in our gut\\nor the absence of nutrients in our gut,\\nand stimulating us to seek out food\\nor to stop eating certain foods,\\nand we have a slower\\nhormone-related system\\nthat also originates in the\\ngut and impacts the brain.\\nBut all of those converge on\\nneural circuits for feeding.\\nThe neural circuits for feeding\\ninclude things like the arcuate\\nnucleus of the hypothalamus,\\nthey include a bunch of\\nother neurochemicals,\\nbut the point is that\\nyou've got a fast route\\nand a slow route to drive\\nyou to eat more or eat less,\\nright, to seek out food and\\nconsume it or to stop eating,\\nto essentially kickstart\\nthe satiety mechanisms\\nas they're called,\\nand those are operating in parallel.\\nIt's not like one happens first\\nthen stops then the other.\\nThey're always operating in parallel.\\nAnd I bring this up because\\nthere's a bigger theme here\\nwhich we see over and\\nover again in biology,\\nwhich is the concept of parallel pathways.\\nYou've always got multiple\\naccelerators and multiple brakes\\non a system.\\nIt's very, very rare to\\nhave just one accelerator\\nand one brake on the system.\\nAnd this will become important later\\nwhen we talk about tools for\\noptimizing your gut microbiome\\nfor healthy eating and for\\nhealth healthy digestion\\nand for healthy brain function.\\nI want to take a moment and talk\\nabout glucagon-like peptide 1,\\nwhich is also called GLP-1.\\nGLP-1 is made by neurons in the gut\\nand by neurons in the brain.\\nThis is a fairly recent discovery\\nbut it's an important one.\\nGLP-1 tends to inhibit feeding\\nand tends to reduce appetite.\\nThere are a number of drugs\\nreleased on the market now,\\none for instance goes\\nby the name semaglutide,\\nwhich is essentially an GLP-1 agonist.\\nIt causes the release of more GLP-1.\\nIt's being used to treat type II diabetes,\\nwhich is insulin resistant diabetes.\\nThis is different than type I diabetes\\nwhere people don't actually make insulin.\\nIt's also being used as\\na drug to reduce obesity.\\nAnd it seems pretty effective\\nat least in certain populations.\\nThere are certain foods and\\nsubstances that increase GLP-1.\\nI've talked about a few\\nof these on the podcast.\\nOne that I'm a particular fan\\nof for entirely other reasons\\nis yerba mate tea can\\nstimulate the release of GLP-1.\\nIn South America, it's often used\\nas an appetite suppressant,\\nprobably in large part\\nbecause of its effect on GLP-1 release,\\nbut probably also because\\nit does contain caffeine,\\nwhich is a bit of a stimulant,\\nwhich also can be involved in lipolysis,\\nwhich is the utilization of fat stores\\nfor energy and so forth.\\nA brief mention about yerba mate.\\nThere are some reports\\nout there that yerba mate\\ncan increase certain types of cancers.\\nThe data that I've seen on this\\nis that it tends to\\nrelate to whether or not\\nthose are smoked versions\\nof the yerba mate tea,\\nthe amount of consumption,\\nand the debate is still out.\\nSo I invite you to look at those papers.\\nYou can search for those online.\\nNonetheless, yerba mate is one\\nsource of GLP-1 stimulation.\\nSemaglutide is another source.\\nIt also can be stimulated\\nby various foods, nuts,\\navocados, eggs, and so forth.\\nCertain high fiber complex grains\\nwill also stimulate GLP-1.\\nI raise this as not necessarily a route\\nthat you want to take in\\norder to reduce food intake.\\nI don't even know that that's your goal.\\nBut that GLP-1 is another one\\nof these gut-to-brain signaling mechanisms\\nthat adjusts appetite\\nthat is dependent on diet,\\ndepends on what you eat or drink,\\nand that the GLP-1 pathway\\ndoes seem particularly sensitive\\nto the constituents of diet.\\nThere's at least one quality study\\nI was able to find showing\\nthat the ketogenic diet for instance,\\nwhich almost always involves ingestion\\nof very low levels of carbohydrate\\ncan increase GLP-1.\\nAlthough, as I mentioned before,\\nthere are other foods that fall\\noutside the range of what\\nwe would consider ketogenic\\nthat can also stimulate GLP-1,\\nand as I mentioned,\\nthere are prescription\\ndrugs, like semaglutide,\\nthere are other ones as well now,\\nthat stimulate GLP-1.\\nSo how does GLP-1 reduce appetite?\\nIt does that, in part, by\\nchanging the activity of neurons\\nin the hypothalamus,\\nthis cluster of neurons just\\nabove the roof of our mouth,\\nthat themselves make GLP-1\\nand that cause the\\nactivation of motor circuits\\nfor reaching, chewing, all the things\\nthat we associate with feeding behavior.\\nSo I use GLP-1 as an example of a pathway\\nthat you might choose to tap into\\nby ingestion of yerba mate\\nor by ingestion of the foods I mentioned,\\nor if it's something that\\ninterests you, ketogenic diet.\\nBut I also mention it simply\\nbecause it's another beautiful example\\nof how a hormone pathway\\ncan impact the activity\\nof brain circuits that\\nare directly involved\\nin a particular behavior.\\nSo yet another example of how\\ngut is communicating to brain\\nin order to change what we think we want\\nor to change what our\\nactual behaviors are.\\nSo the next time you find\\nyourself reaching for food,\\nor you find yourself wanting\\na particular sweet thing\\nor fatty thing or something that contains\\na lot of amino acids,\\na protein rich food,\\nkeep in mind that that's not just\\nabout the taste of the food,\\nand it's not even necessarily\\nabout the nutrients\\nthat you need or don't need.\\nIt could be,\\nbut it's also about this\\nsubconscious signaling\\nthat's coming from your body all the time,\\nwaves of hormones, waves\\nof nerve cell signals,\\nelectrical signals that\\nare changing the way\\nthat your brain works.\\nAnd this raises for me\\na memory of the episode that I\\ndid with Dr. Robert Sapolsky,\\nwho's a world expert\\ncolleague of mine at Stanford,\\nwho is expert on things\\nlike hormones and behavior.\\nBut we got into the topic of free will,\\nwhich is a bit of a barbed wire topic\\nas many of you know.\\nIt gets into the realm\\nof philosophy, et cetera.\\nAnd we were kind of batting back and forth\\nthe idea, I was saying, \\\"Well,\\nI think there's free will,\\nand can't there certainly be free will\\nor certainly the idea that we\\ncan avoid certain choices?\\\"\\nAnd Robert was saying, \\\"No.\\\"\\nIn fact, he said, \\\"Nah,\\\"\\nhe doesn't believe\\nthat we have any free will.\\nHe thinks that events in\\nour brain are determined\\nby biological events that are\\nbelow our conscious detection\\nand that occur seconds to milliseconds\\nbefore we make decisions or assessments\\nand, therefore, we just\\ncan't control what we do,\\nwhat we think, and what we feel.\\nAnd at the time I sort of didn't buy it.\\nI thought, I don't know.\\nI just, I guess I really\\nwanted to believe in free will.\\nAnd to some extent I still do\\nbut as we talk about how\\nthese neurons in our gut\\nand these hormones in our\\ngut are influencing our brain\\nand the decisions that we are making,\\nat the level of circuits,\\nlike the hypothalamus\\nand the nucleus of the solitary tract,\\nthese are areas of the brain\\nway below our frontal cortex\\nand our conscious perception.\\nThink these are examples that really fall\\nin favor of what Dr. Sapolsky was arguing,\\nwhich is that events that\\nare happening within our body\\nare actually changing\\nthe way our brain works.\\nSo we might think that\\nwe want the cupcake.\\nWe might think that we\\ndon't need to eat something\\nor do need to eat something\\nand that is entirely on the\\nbasis of prior knowledge\\nand decision-making that\\nwe're making with our head,\\nbut in fact,\\nit's very clear to me based on the work\\nfrom the Bohorquez lab,\\nclassic work over the years\\ndating back to the '80s,\\nand indeed back to the '50s\\nthat we'll talk about in a moment,\\nthat our body is shaping the decisions\\nthat our brain is making and\\nwe're not aware of it at all.\\nNow, the good news is that\\nwhether or not you believe\\nin free will or not, the simple knowledge\\nthat this whole process is happening\\ncan perhaps be a benefit to you.\\nYou can perhaps leverage\\nit to get some insight\\nand understanding and perhaps even a wedge\\ninto your own behavior.\\nYou might think, ah, I think\\nI want that particular food,\\nor I think I want to avoid\\nthat particular food,\\nbut actually that's not a decision\\nthat I'm making on a\\npurely rational basis.\\nHas a lot to do with what\\nmy gut is telling my brain.\\nSo we've largely been talking\\nabout chemical communication\\nbetween the gut and the brain.\\nChemical because even\\nthough these neuropod cells\\nare communicating with the brain\\nby way of electrical activity,\\nwhat we call action potentials,\\nand in neural language\\nwe call those spikes,\\nspikes of action potentials,\\nspikes of action potentials,\\nmeaning those neural signals,\\ncause the release of chemicals\\nin the brain like dopamine.\\nSo it's chemical transmission.\\nSimilarly, hormones, even\\nthough they act more slowly,\\nhormones like neuropeptide\\nY like CCK, like ghrelin,\\nthey are signaling chemically.\\nThey're moving through the body,\\nthey're going in there\\naffecting the chemical output\\nof different cells,\\nand they're changing the\\nchemistry of those cells\\nand the chemistry of the cells\\nthat those cells talk to.\\nSo that gives us one particular\\ncategory of signaling\\nfrom gut to brain, which\\nis chemical signaling.\\nBut of course there are\\nother forms of signals\\nand those fall under the\\ncategory of mechanical signaling.\\nYou're probably familiar with this.\\nIf you've ever eaten a very large meal\\nor consumed a lot of fluid,\\nyou experience that as\\ndistension of the gut\\nand that doesn't just have to\\nbe distension of the stomach,\\nbut distension of your intestines as well.\\nThat distension is registered by neurons\\nthat reside in your gut,\\nthe signals go up to your brain,\\nand communicate with areas of the brain\\nthat are responsible for suppressing\\nfurther consumption of food and/or fluid,\\nand, under certain circumstances,\\ncan also be associated with the activation\\nof neural circuits that cause vomiting\\nor the desire to vomit.\\nSo if ever you've eaten too\\nmuch or you've eaten something\\nthat doesn't agree with you,\\nthat information is communicated\\nby way of mechanosensors\\nthat sense the mechanics of your gut,\\npossibly also the chemistry of your gut,\\nbut mostly the mechanics of your gut,\\nsignal up to the brain,\\nand activate brain\\ncenters that are involved\\nin stopping the eating behavior,\\nand activation of an\\narea of the brain stem\\nthat is affectionately referred to\\nas the vomit center among neuroanatomists.\\nThis is a area that more appropriately\\nis called the chemoreceptor\\ntrigger zone, the CTZ,\\nor area postrema\\nand neurons in this area\\nactually will trigger\\nthe vomiting reflex.\\nSo the way that the gut\\nand the brain communicate\\nis both chemical and mechanical,\\nand it can be both for sake\\nof increasing certain types of behavior.\\nToday, we're talking mainly\\nabout feeding behavior\\nup until now anyway\\nbut also ceasing to\\neat, closing your mouth,\\nmoving away from food,\\nturning away from food,\\nall behaviors that we're familiar with\\nanytime we feel kind of sick\\non the basis of activation\\nof this mechanosensor\\nfor gastric distress.\\nSo we've got chemical signaling\\nand mechanical signaling.\\nAnd I also want to emphasize that we have\\ndirect and indirect signaling\\nfrom the gut to the brain.\\nDirect signaling is the kind of signaling\\nof the sort I've been talking\\nabout mainly up until now,\\nwhich is neurons in the gut\\ncommunicating with\\nneurons in the brain stem\\nthat communicate with\\nneurons in the hypothalamus.\\nAnd, of course, those are\\nalso going to interact\\nwith neurons of the prefrontal cortex\\nwhich is the area of a brain\\ninvolved in decision making\\nthe, you know, I think it was\\nthe shrimp that made me sick.\\nI'm going to, I just don't\\nwant any more of that.\\nOr I'm never going back\\nto that restaurant again\\nbecause after I ate there\\nabout an hour later,\\nI started feeling really not well.\\nI felt, you know, kind of feverish,\\nbut my gut didn't feel well,\\nmy digestion was really off.\\nAll of that kind of information\\nis handled in the prefrontal\\ncortex at a conscious level,\\nbut the immediate decision to stop eating\\nor to eat more of something\\nto move towards something\\nor away from it, that's\\nmade by neural circuits\\nthat reside at the, we would say,\\nthe subconscious level\\nbut what we really mean is below\\nthe level of the neocortex.\\nBelow the cortex means\\nessentially below our level\\nof conscious awareness.\\nSo we talked about two types\\nof information within the gut\\nthat are communicated to the brain,\\nchemical information, meaning information\\nabout the nutrients\\nthat happen to be there,\\nand mechanical information,\\ndistention of the gut or lack\\nof distention and so forth.\\nAnd we talked about how\\nthese neuropod cells\\ncan signal the release\\nof dopamine and circuits\\nwithin the brain to cause you\\nto seek out more of something.\\nNow, in a very logically consistent way,\\ndopamine is also involved in\\nthe whole business of vomiting.\\nYou might think, well, that\\ndoesn't make any sense.\\nI thought dopamine was\\nalways a good thing.\\nIt's involved in moderation\\nand reward, et cetera.\\nBut it turns out the area postrema,\\nthis vomit center in the brain stem,\\nis chockablock full of dopamine receptors.\\nAnd if dopamine levels go too high,\\nit can actually trigger vomiting.\\nAnd this we see in the\\ncontext of various drugs\\nthat are used to treat\\nthings like Parkinson's.\\nParkinson's is a deficiency in dopamine\\nor a lack of dopamine neurons typically\\nthat causes a resting tremor,\\ndifficulty in movement,\\nbecause dopamine's also associated\\nwith a lot of the neural\\ncircuits for movement.\\nMany drugs that are used\\nto treat Parkinson's\\nlike L-DOPA increase\\nlevels of dopamine so much,\\nor at least activate dopamine receptors\\nto such a great degree in\\ncertain areas of the brain\\nthat they can cause activation of things\\nlike the trigger to vomit.\\nNow, this should also make\\nsense in the natural context\\nof if you gorge yourself with food,\\ngorge yourself with food,\\ngorge yourself with food,\\nthe neurons in your gut\\nthat respond to that\\nare simply detecting the\\npresence of nutrients\\nbut they don't really\\nmake decisions themselves.\\nThey don't know to stop eating.\\nYour brain knows to stop\\neating or to eject that food.\\nAnd so it's a wonderful\\nthing that those neurons\\nare communicating with areas of the brain\\nnot just that stimulate\\nconsuming more food\\nbut that are communicating\\nwith areas of the brain,\\nfor instance, area postrema,\\nthat when dopamine levels get too high,\\ncause us to either stop eating that food\\nor in the case of vomiting\\nto eject that food.\\nSo I raise this not to give you\\na kind of a disgusting counterexample\\nto what we call appetitive behaviors,\\nthe things that we like to do more of,\\nbut simply to give you a\\nsense of just how strongly\\neven these reflexes that we think of\\nas feeling sick and vomiting\\nor the desire to seek out more food\\nare really being controlled\\nby a kind of push-pull system,\\nby parallel pathways that\\nare arriving from our gut\\nand the same neurochemicals,\\nin this case dopamine,\\nare being used to create\\ntwo opposite type behaviors,\\none behavior to consume more,\\none behavior to get rid of everything\\nyou've already consumed.\\nSo our brain is actually sensitive\\nto the amount of signaling\\ncoming from our gut\\nnot just the path by\\nwhich that signal arrives.\\nOur brain is very\\ncarefully paying attention\\nto whether or not the levels of dopamine\\nthat are being triggered\\nare within a normal range\\nfor typical eating behavior\\nor whether or not we've gorged ourselves\\nto the point where enough already.\\nNow, of course, mechanical signals\\nwill also play into area postrema\\nand into the vomiting reflex.\\nIf we have a very distended gut,\\nwe feel lousy.\\nIt just, it actually can hurt very badly,\\nand we will have the desire to vomit,\\nor we will just simply vomit.\\nMechanical and chemical signals\\nare always arriving in parallel.\\nThey never work in unison.\\nAnd so now we have chemical\\nsignals, mechanical signals,\\nand now I'd like to talk about\\ndirect and indirect signals\\nbecause almost everything\\nI've talked about up until now\\nare direct signals, a neural\\npathway that converges\\nin the brain to create\\na particular feeling,\\nthought, or behavior,\\nbut there are also indirect pathways.\\nAnd that's what takes us\\nback to the gut microbiome\\nand to these little microbiota.\\nAnd to just give you the takeaway\\nmessage at the front here\\nand then I'll give you\\na little more detail\\nas to how it comes about,\\nyou have neurotransmitters in your brain\\nand in your spinal cord and in your eyes\\nand in your peripheral nervous system.\\nThey cause the activation\\nor the suppression\\nof nerve activity,\\nmeaning they either electrically\\nactivate other nerve cells\\nor they cause other nerve cells\\nto be less electrically active.\\nAnd they do that by way\\nof neurotransmitters.\\nBut as it turns out,\\nthe gut microbiota are capable\\nof influencing metabolic events\\nand in some cases are capable\\nof synthesizing\\nneurotransmitters themselves.\\nSo what that means is\\nthat these little bugs,\\nthese little microbiota\\nthat are cargo in your gut,\\nthe six pounds of cargo,\\nthey actually can make neurochemicals\\nthat can pass into the bloodstream\\nand into your brain and actually impact\\nthe other cells of your\\nbody and brain indirectly,\\nso without involving these\\nvery intricate nerve pathways\\nthat we've been talking about.\\nIn other words, the foods you eat,\\nthe environment of your gut microbiome,\\ncan actually create\\nthe chemical substrates\\nthat allow your brain to\\nfeel one way or the other,\\nto feel great or to feel lousy,\\nto seek out more of a\\nparticular type of behavior\\nor to avoid that behavior.\\nAnd that would constitute\\nindirect signaling.\\nSo I've been talking a lot\\nabout the structure and function\\nof the gut-to-brain pathway,\\nfocusing mainly on feeding behaviors\\nand in some cases avoiding\\nfeeding or even ejecting food\\nfrom the digestive tract,\\nI'd like to drill a little bit deeper\\ninto this indirect signaling pathway\\nfrom the gut to the brain\\nbecause it bridges us\\nnicely from neuronal signals\\nin the gut to the brain,\\nhormonal signals from\\nthe gut to the brain,\\nto what also includes the microbiome,\\nwhich is what we started talking about\\nat the beginning of the episode.\\nAs I mentioned a couple of minutes ago,\\ncertain gut microbiota\\ncan actually synthesize\\ncertain neurotransmitters\\nthat can go impact the brain.\\nAnd we actually have some\\nknowledge about which microbiota\\ncan synthesize particular\\nneurotransmitters.\\nFor instance, the neuromodulator dopamine\\ncan be synthesized\\nby or from bacillus and serratia.\\nNow, these are just names of microbiota.\\nI don't expect that any of you\\nwould necessarily recognize them.\\nThese aren't the sorts of\\nthings that you necessarily\\nwould run out and buy\\nto get more dopamine.\\nBut the point is that\\nparticular gut microbiota\\ncan create dopamine in our gut\\nthat can get into our bloodstream\\nand can generally change our\\nbaseline levels of dopamine\\nwithin the brain and\\nother areas of the body.\\nI mentioned baseline levels of dopamine\\nbecause as I talked about on\\nan episode all about dopamine\\nbut I'll just repeat the basics here now,\\nwe have baseline levels\\nof transmitters or neuromodulators\\nthat act as sort of the level of the tide,\\nthe overall level,\\nand then we can have peaks of dopamine\\nthat are created by behaviors\\nor by ingestion of particular\\nfoods or drugs, et cetera.\\nSo bacillus and serratia tend to increase\\nour baseline levels of dopamine.\\nSo if it turns out that we are creating\\nthe right gut microbiome environment\\nthat these particular gut\\nmicrobiota can thrive in,\\nwell, then our baseline levels\\nof dopamine will be elevated\\nand in general, that leads\\nto enhancement of mood.\\nSimilarly, there are other gut microbiota,\\nfor instance, candida,\\nstreptococus, various enterococcus,\\nthese always have these kind of strange\\nand not so attractive\\nnames, at least to me\\nas a neurobiologist.\\nNonetheless, those particular microbiota\\nsupport the production of\\nor can even be metabolized\\ninto serotonin, which is a neuromodulator\\nassociated with mood,\\nwith social interactions,\\nwith a huge number of different types\\nof events and behaviors.\\nAgain, these gut microbiota when present\\nand allowed to thrive in our gut\\nwill increase our overall\\nlevels of serotonin\\nand riding on top of\\nthat level of serotonin\\nwill be the serotonin\\nthat's specifically released\\nin response to certain behaviors.\\nAnd I really want to drive home this point\\nof baselines and peaks.\\nThe baseline level of serotonin\\nmight set our overall mood,\\nwhether or not we wake\\nup feeling pretty good\\nor really lousy if our serotonin levels\\nhappen to be very, very low,\\nwhether or not we tend to\\nbe in a kind of a calm space\\nor whether or not we tend\\nto be somewhat irritable.\\nBut then of course individual\\nevents as we go about our day,\\nmaybe a compliment that we get\\nor maybe somebody says\\nsomething irritating to us,\\nwhatever it may be will also\\ninfluence levels of serotonin,\\nbut those serotonin events\\nare going to be related\\nto events at particular\\nneural circuits in the brain.\\nAnd this is an important topic\\nbecause I think that a lot of\\npeople hear quite accurately,\\noh, 90 to 95% of our serotonin\\nis manufactured in the gut.\\nAnd indeed that's true.\\nIt's manufactured from\\nthe sorts of microbiota\\nthat I just described.\\nAnd there are many, many experiments now,\\nmostly in animal models,\\nbut also some in humans that\\nshow that if the gut microbiome\\nis deficient in some way to\\nthese particular bacteria,\\nthat serotonin levels drop\\nand people's mood suffers,\\nmaybe even their immune system functions,\\nmaybe even it exacerbates\\ncertain psychiatric illnesses.\\nHowever, a lot of people take that to mean\\nthat the serotonin of the\\nbrain all comes from the gut\\nor mostly comes from the gut.\\nThat's not the case.\\nIt's still the case that you\\nhave neurons in the brain\\nthat are responsible\\nfor releasing serotonin\\ndirectly in response to certain\\nthings like social touch\\nor through other types of\\npositive social experiences.\\nSo we've got gut microbiota\\nthat can literally be turned into dopamine\\nand raise our baseline levels of dopamine.\\nWe've got gut microbiota\\nthat can literally raise our\\nbaseline levels of serotonin.\\nAnd indeed there are other gut\\nmicrobiota like lactobacillus\\nor bifidobacterium, excuse me,\\nhard complex names to pronounce,\\nbifidobacterium that can give rise\\nto increases in GABA levels,\\nthis inhibitory neurotransmitter\\nthat can act as a little\\nbit of a mild sedative,\\ncan reduce irritability, et cetera,\\nbut that's just the baseline,\\nthe kind of tide of those neuromodulators.\\nAgain, I want to emphasize\\nthat we still have\\nneurocircuits within the brain and body\\nthat are specifically\\nreleasing in a very potent way\\ndopamine, serotonin, and GABA.\\nSo the two things act in concert.\\nEven though the gut and\\nthe brain are acting\\nboth in parallel and directly\\ninfluencing one another,\\nit is a powerful synergistic effect.\\nAnd there are now hundreds of studies,\\nmaybe even thousands by this point,\\nmostly performed in animal models,\\ntypically mice, but also\\nsome studies in humans\\nthat show that creating\\nthe correct environment\\nfor these gut microbiota to thrive\\nreally does enhance mood and wellbeing.\\nAnd that when our gut\\nmicrobiome is not healthy,\\nthat it really can deplete our\\nmood and sense of wellbeing.\\nNow, there are two major phases\\nto creating a healthy gut microbiome.\\nOne you can control and the other one\\nis less under your control.\\nI get into this in a lot of detail\\nin the episode with Dr. Sonnenburg,\\nwhich is coming out\\nimmediately after this one,\\nthe following Monday, that is.\\nBut for now I want to just\\ncapture a few of the main points\\nabout the early establishment\\nof the gut microbiome.\\nIt turns out that the environment\\nthat we are exposed to,\\nthe things that come into\\ncontact with our skin\\nand digestive tract and\\nany other mucosal lining,\\neven the urethra, the nasal passages,\\nany opening to the outside world\\nthat brings in certain, excuse me,\\ncertain microbiota in the\\nfirst three years of life\\nis going to have a profound impact\\non the overall menu of microbiota\\nthat we will be able to\\ncarry within our body.\\nAnd it really does seem\\nthat getting exposure to\\nand building a diverse microbiome\\nin those first three years is critical.\\nThere's a lot of speculation and some data\\nas to cesarean delivered babies\\nhaving less diverse microbiomes\\ncompared to vaginally delivered babies.\\nThere have been attempts,\\nalthough not conclusive attempts,\\nto link that to the presence\\nof autism spectrum disorders,\\nwhich at least by some statistics\\nseem to be of higher probability\\nin cesarean deliveries\\nalthough there are other\\nstudies that refute that,\\nand I want to make that clear.\\nHowever, it's clear that\\nbabies do not get much,\\nif any, exposure to\\nmicrobiota inside of the womb,\\nmaybe a little bit, but not much.\\nBut that is during the birth process\\nand in the days and\\nweeks immediately after\\nthey arrive in the world\\nthat their gut microbiome\\nis established, that those gut microbiota\\ntake residence within the gut.\\nSo it will depend on whether\\nor not they were breastfed\\nor bottle fed.\\nIt'll depend on whether\\nor not they were exposed\\nto a household pet or not,\\nwhether or not they were\\nheld by multiple caregivers\\nor just by one,\\nwhether or not they were a preemie baby\\nand were contained in a\\nparticularly restrictive environment\\nin order to encourage\\ntheir further development\\nbefore they could be brought home or not.\\nI don't want to give the picture\\nthat if you were isolated\\nor you were delivered by C-section,\\nthat you're somehow doomed\\nto have a poor microbiome.\\nThat's simply not the case.\\nHowever, it is the case\\nthat the more diversity\\nof microbiota that one\\ncan create early in life\\nis really helpful for long-term outcomes\\nin terms of brain-to-gut signaling,\\ngut-to-brain signaling,\\nand for sake of the immune system.\\nThere are some decent studies showing\\nthat if children are exposed\\nto a lot of antibiotic\\ntreatment early in life,\\nthat can be very\\ndetrimental to establishment\\nof a healthy gut microbiome.\\nAnd fortunately that reestablishing\\na healthy gut microbiome\\ncan help rescue some of those deficits.\\nSo doctors nowadays are much more cautious\\nabout the prescription of\\nantibiotic drugs to children\\nin their early years, not\\njust up to three years,\\nbut extending out to five\\nand seven and 10 years.\\nAnd even in adults, they're\\nvery, very careful about that,\\nor they ought to be.\\nOne reason is the\\nexistence, or I would say,\\nthe proliferation of\\nantibiotic-resistant bacteria\\nthat are becoming more common\\nin hospitals and elsewhere\\nand that can cause serious problems.\\nBut in addition to that,\\nbecause of this understanding\\nthat the gut microbiome\\nis influencing and actually\\ncreating neurotransmitters\\nthat can impact mood and mental health,\\nimpact immune health, and so on.\\nAs I mentioned earlier, there are hundreds\\nif not thousands of studies\\nemphasizing the key role\\nof the microbiome on brain health,\\npsychiatric health, et cetera.\\nI want to just highlight\\na few of those studies\\nand in particular, some recent\\nstudies that come from labs\\nthat have been working\\non this sort of thing\\nfor a very long time.\\nOne of the more exciting\\nstudies comes from the work\\nof Mauro Costa-Mattioli's lab,\\nwhich is at Baylor College of Medicine.\\nMauro's lab has been\\nworking on mouse models\\nof autism spectrum\\ndisorder for a long time,\\nand looking at social behavior\\nusing a mouse model for a long time.\\nAnd they've been able to identify\\nparticular types of microbiota\\nthat when they take resonance in the gut\\ncan help offset some of\\nthe symptoms of autism,\\nat least the symptoms of autism\\nthat exist in these mouse models, okay?\\nSo again, this is not human work.\\nThis is work being done on mouse models\\nfor the simple reason that you can do\\nthese kinds of manipulations,\\nwhere basically they took mice\\nthat were in germ free-environments\\nor non-germ-free environments,\\nor they exposed mice to\\nparticular microbiota\\nand not other microbiota\\nand they discovered that\\na particular microbiota\\ncalled L. reuteri,\\nit's L. R-E-U-T-E-R-I.\\nTreatment with L. reuteri\\ncorrects the social deficits\\npresent in these autism models\\nand it does so by way of\\nactivating our old friend\\nthe vagus nerve,\\nbut not simply because the vagus nerve\\ntriggers the release of dopamine,\\nbut it turns out that this\\nparticular gut microbiota\\nL. reuteri can correct the social deficits\\nin this autism spectrum disorder model.\\nIt does that by way of\\na vagal nerve pathway\\nthat stimulates both dopamine\\nrelease and oxytocin release.\\nAnd they establish this\\nreally mechanistically\\nby showing, for instance,\\nif you get rid of the oxytocin receptor,\\nyou don't see this rescue.\\nNow, those are mouse models\\nso we have to take those with\\nthe appropriate grain of salt,\\nbut they're really exciting.\\nAnd they come to us in\\nparallel with other studies\\nthat are being done,\\ntaking the microbiomes of people\\nwho have one condition\\nor lack of condition,\\nand putting it into people\\nwho have one condition\\nor another condition.\\nLet me explain what I mean by that.\\nThe early discovery of the gut microbiome\\nand its potential to impact health\\nwas not in the context of\\nthe gut-to-brain pathway\\nbut rather it was in\\nthe context of colitis.\\nThis dates back to studies in the '50s,\\nwhereby people with very\\nsevere intractable colitis\\nfor which no other\\ntreatment was going to work\\nreceived fecal transplants.\\nSo yes, that's exactly as it sounds.\\nTaking the stool of healthy\\npeople who do not have colitis,\\ntransplanting those stools\\ninto the lower digestive tract\\nof people who do have colitis,\\nand they saw significant improvement,\\nif not rescue of the colitis.\\nThat was one of the first indications\\nthat something within\\nstool, of all things,\\ncould actually rescue another\\nindividual from disease,\\nwhich sounds kind of wild and crazy,\\nand may even sound\\ndisgusting to some of you,\\nbut as I mentioned at the\\nbeginning of the episode,\\nalmost 60% of stool is\\nlive or dead bacteria,\\nmicrobiota, and it really\\nopened up this entire field\\nof exploring how different microbiota\\nmight have therapeutic effects.\\nAnd indeed, that has\\nbeen shown to be the case\\nalso in fecal transplants for\\ncertain psychiatric illnesses.\\nThese are still ongoing studies.\\nThey vary in quality.\\nThese are hard studies to\\ndo for all sorts of reasons,\\ngetting the appropriate\\npatient populations,\\ngetting agreement, et cetera,\\nmaking sure that everything's\\nhandled properly.\\nBut what this involves\\nis fecal transplants\\nfrom individuals that lack\\na particular psychiatric condition\\nor metabolic condition into people\\nwho have a particular metabolic condition\\nand there has been tremendous\\nsuccess in some cases.\\nOne of the more powerful\\nand salient examples\\nis for obesity.\\nThere's some people for\\nwhich even if they ingest\\nvery low numbers of calories,\\neven if they go on a liquid protein diet,\\nsimply can't lose weight.\\nThese are somewhat rare disorders\\nbut these are people that would\\neither get gastric bypass surgery.\\nSome people are now getting\\nthese fecal transplants\\nfrom people that have\\nhealthy weight and they\\ntake the stool from them,\\nthey put it into lower digestive tract,\\nand they can see substantial\\nimprovement in weight loss\\nin people that were\\notherwise unable to do that.\\nIn some cases, actually\\nthey can start eating\\nrelatively normal levels of\\nfood and still lose weight.\\nSo pretty remarkable\\nand that tells us there's\\nsomething in these microbiota\\nthat's really powerful.\\nNow, how those effects\\nare generated isn't clear.\\nOne idea is that it's\\nimpacting the metabolome,\\ncomponents of the metabolism,\\nalmost certainly that's\\ngoing to be the case.\\nAnother idea is that it's\\nimpacting neurotransmitters\\nwhich change behavior and\\nfood choices within the brain.\\nAlthough, as I mentioned,\\nsome of these people\\nare already eating very\\nlittle food to begin with\\nso that's a little bit harder\\nof an argument to create.\\nThere are also some\\nsomewhat famous examples now\\nof how fecal transplants can\\nlead to negative outcomes.\\nBut those negative\\noutcomes further underscore\\nthe power of the microbiome\\nin impacting bodily health.\\nOne key example of this, for instance,\\nis transfer of fecal\\nmatter into another person\\nin order to treat something like colitis\\nand it effectively does that,\\nbut if the donor of the\\nstool, of the fecal matter\\nhappened to be obese or have\\nsome other metabolic syndrome,\\nit's been observed that the recipient\\ncan also develop that metabolic syndrome\\nsimply by way of receiving\\nthat donor's particular microbiota.\\nSo these microbiota can\\ncreate positive outcomes\\nor they can create negative outcomes.\\nNow, most of us of course,\\nare not interested in\\nor pursuing fecal transplants.\\nMost people are interested\\nin just creating\\na healthy gut microbiome environment\\nfor sake of immune system\\nand brain function.\\nAnd we will talk about how to\\ndo that in just a few minutes.\\nBut I just want to further underscore\\nthe power of the microbiota\\nin shaping brain chemistry\\nand in shaping things like mood\\nor other aspects of mental health\\nthat typically we don't\\nassociate with our gut.\\nThere are several studies\\npublished in recent years,\\none that I'll just highlight now,\\nfirst author is Tonya Nguyen, N-G-U-Y-E-N.\\nThe title of the paper is\\n\\\"Association of Loneliness and Wisdom\\nwith Gut Microbial\\nDiversity and Composition,\\nan Exploratory Study\\\".\\nIt's an interesting study.\\nLooked at 184 community\\ndwelling adults, excuse me,\\nranging from 28 to 97 years old.\\nThey explored whether or not\\nhaving enhanced microbial diversity\\nsomehow related to these variables\\nthat they refer to as\\nloneliness and wisdom.\\nThey used a number of different\\ntests to evaluate those.\\nThose are common tests in\\nthe psychology literature,\\nnot so much in the biology literature,\\nbut nonetheless, there are\\nways of measuring things\\nlike loneliness and wisdom,\\nwisdom in this case, being\\nthe opposite of loneliness,\\nat least in the context of this study.\\nAnd what they found was the\\nmore microbial diversity,\\nthe more diverse one's microbiome was,\\nthe lower incidence of loneliness.\\nAnd they did this by taking fecal samples,\\nprofiling them for RNA.\\nSo essentially doing gene\\nsequencing of the stool\\nof these individuals,\\ngetting ratings of how lonely\\nor not lonely they felt,\\nand correlating those.\\nAnd that's just but one study.\\nI point it out because\\nit's particularly recent\\nand it looked like it was\\nparticularly well done.\\nThere is another study that\\nI'll just refer you to.\\nThis was a study published in\\n2020 in \\\"Scientific Reports\\\".\\nThe title of the study\\nis \\\"Emotional Wellbeing\\nand Gut Microbiome\\nProfiles by Enterotype\\\".\\nWhat I particularly like about this study\\nis that they were able\\nto correlate the presence\\nof certain microbiota with\\nfeelings of subjective wellbeing\\nand lack of or presence\\nof depressive symptoms.\\nThey did high-throughput gene sequencing\\nof the microbiomes of individuals.\\nSo that meant measuring the microbiota,\\nfiguring out which\\nmicrobiota were present,\\nhow diverse their\\nmicrobiome was in general.\\nGut microbiome diversity is a good thing.\\nAnd then to correlate\\nthat with what's called\\nthe PANAS score.\\nPANAS stands for positive\\naffect negative affect schedule.\\nThis is a test that my\\nlab has used extensively,\\nthat other labs to use to\\nevaluate mood and wellbeing.\\nAnd they defined what were\\ncalled three enterotypes,\\nthree different categories of people\\nthat ate very different diets\\nthat tended to fall into\\ncategories of having more\\nor fewer emotional\\nsymptoms that were negative\\nor more fewer emotional\\nsymptoms that were positive\\nand whether or not they tend\\nto be more depressed, anxious,\\nor have more stress-related\\nbehaviors, et cetera.\\nAnd what they were able\\nto derive from this study\\nwas some strong indications\\nabout what types of things\\nwe should ingest in our diet,\\nmaybe even certain things\\nthat we should avoid,\\nbut certainly the types of\\nthings that we should ingest,\\nthat can enhance mood and wellbeing\\nand can tend to shift people away\\nfrom more depressive-like anxiety\\nand stress-related symptoms.\\nBefore we get into what the\\nparticular food items were\\nthat lend themselves to\\na healthy microbiome,\\nI want to raise a bigger and\\nperhaps more important issue,\\nwhich is what is a healthy microbiome.\\nI think if you asked any\\nnumber of world experts,\\nand I certainly ask\\nthis of Dr. Sonnenburg,\\nwhat is a healthy microbiome,\\nthey're all going to tell you\\nit's a microbiome that\\nhas a lot of diversity,\\nthat includes a lot of\\ndifferent types of bacteria.\\nAnd that makes sense\\nbecause it logically\\nwould include the bacteria\\nthat produce GABA and\\ndopamine and serotonin,\\nand that support the immune system,\\nand do a number of different things.\\nBut is it simply the case that\\nadding microbiota diversity\\nis always a good thing?\\nWell, that doesn't seem to be the case.\\nProbiotics and prebiotics,\\nboth of which can enhance\\nmicrobiotal diversity,\\ncan improve mood, digestion,\\nimmune system, and so on.\\nThat's been established but\\nit's mainly been established\\nin the context of\\npost-antibiotic treatment\\nor people that are recovering from illness\\nor people that have been very stressed\\nor have been dealing with\\nall sorts of challenges,\\nmental or physical,\\nand they are an attempt to\\nreplenish the gut microbiome.\\nHowever, it's also clear\\nthat excessive microbiota\\nbrought about by excessive\\nintake of probiotics\\ncan lead to things like brain fog.\\nThere's actually some good\\nstudies that point to the fact\\nthat certain metabolites\\nof the microbiome,\\ncertain chemicals produced in the gut\\nand in the body can actually\\nlead to brain fog states.\\nThis is thought to come about\\nthrough the lactate pathways\\nof the gut that can then impact the brain.\\nIf you want to look more into this issue\\nof whether or not probiotics\\ntaken in excess perhaps\\ncan lead to brain fog,\\nI'd encourage you to look\\nat a particular paper.\\nThis is a paper published\\nin \\\"Clinical and Translational\\nGastroenterology\\\".\\nAnd the title of the paper\\nis \\\"Brain Fogginess, Gas, and Bloating,\\na Link Between SIBO Probiotics\\nand Metabolic Acidosis\\\".\\nIt was published in 2018.\\nWe can provide a link to this study.\\nAnd there are several other\\nstudies in the references\\nthat point to the fact that in some cases,\\nexcessive intake of probiotics\\nand excessive proliferation\\nof gut microbiota can\\nactually be problematic.\\nI mention this not to confuse you\\nbut because it is confusing out there.\\nWe all would think that just increasing\\nmicrobiotal diversity\\nis always a good thing\\nbut there are thresholds\\nbeyond which excessive\\nmicrobiotal diversity\\nmight be problematic.\\nI think everyone agrees that having\\ntoo few microbial species\\nliving in us is not a good idea.\\nNow, none of that answers the questions\\nthat I think everyone\\nreally wants answers to,\\nwhich are, what should we do,\\nwhat should we not do to\\nimprove our gut microbiome?\\nI mean, clearly we can't time travel back\\nto when we were zero to three years old\\nand get a dog if we didn't have a dog,\\nget breastfed if we weren't breastfed,\\nbe delivered vaginally as\\nopposed to by C-section\\nif we didn't have that opportunity.\\nWe just can't time travel and do that.\\nAll of us, however, should\\nbe seeking to improve\\nthe conditions of our gut microbiome\\nbecause of the critical\\nways in which it impacts\\nthe rest of our brain and bodily health.\\nSo what should we do,\\nwhat shouldn't we do?\\nClearly we know that stress\\ncan negatively impact\\nthe gut microbiome.\\nHowever, some forms of\\nstress that can quote unquote\\nnegatively impact the microbiome\\ninclude fasting, long periods of fasts,\\nwhich makes sense because a\\nlot of microbiota need food\\nin order to thrive.\\nIn fact, many if not all\\nof them do at some point.\\nThere are other questions\\nsuch as should we eat particular foods\\nand how often should we eat those foods?\\nWe've all been told that\\nfiber is incredibly important\\nbecause of the presence\\nof prebiotic fiber,\\nwhich can essentially feed the microbiome,\\nbut is fiber really necessary\\nand how necessary is it to\\nencourage a healthy microbiome?\\nClearly, there are a number of people\\nfollowing relatively low fiber diets,\\nsuch as ketogenic diets,\\nand those can have, in some cases,\\nanti-inflammatory\\neffects and can sometimes\\nalso improve certain microbiota species.\\nSo it can all be rather confusing.\\nAnd for that matter, I\\nasked our resident expert,\\nDr. Justin Sonnenburg at Stanford,\\nall of these questions.\\nAnd he answers them very systematically\\nin the episode that\\ncomes out after this one.\\nBut I don't want to\\nwithhold anything from you\\nso I'll just give a\\nvery top contour version\\nof those answers and then\\nyou'll get more in-depth answers\\nduring that episode.\\nI asked about fasting.\\nAnd the reason I asked about\\nfasting is that years ago,\\nI was at a meeting as part\\nof the Pew Biomedical Scholars Meeting\\nand one of the other\\nPew Biomedical Scholars\\nwas an expert in gut microbiome\\nand I said, \\\"Hey, are probiotics\\ngood for the microbiome?\\nAnd if so, which ones should I take?\\\"\\nAnd his answer was very interesting.\\nHe said, \\\"You know, in\\ncertain cases they can be,\\nespecially if you're\\ntraveling or you're stressed,\\nbut it turns out that\\nthe particular bacteria\\nthat they put in most probiotics\\ndon't actually replenish the\\nmicrobiota that you need most.\\\"\\nAnd I thought, \\\"Oh, well,\\nwhy don't they make ones\\nthat replenish the microbiota\\nthat you need most?\\\"\\nAnd his answer was, \\\"Well,\\nthey don't replenish those\\nbut they replenish other ones\\nthat then in turn\\nencourage the development\\nof the microbiota that you do want\\nonce you start eating\\nthe appropriate foods.\\nSo they change the environment\\nwhich makes the environment better,\\nwhich indirectly supports\\nthe proliferation\\nof quote unquote good microbiota.\\\"\\nOkay, so that was a\\nsomewhat convoluted answer\\nbut I did appreciate his answer.\\nThen I asked him about fasting.\\nI said, \\\"Well, a lot of\\npeople are getting interested\\nin intermittent fasting now.\\nPeople are spending a significant portion\\nof each 24-hour cycle avoiding food\\nfor sake of time restrictive feeding.\\nWhat does that do to the gut microbiome?\\nDoes it make it healthier or\\ndoes it make it unhealthier?\\\"\\nWell, my colleague from\\nYale and Dr. Sonnenburg\\nboth confirmed that\\nduring periods of fasting,\\nespecially prolonged periods of fasting,\\nwe actually start to digest away\\nmuch of our digestive tract.\\nNow, the whole thing\\ndoesn't start to disappear\\nbut there's thinning of the mucosal lining\\nor the least disruption\\nof the mucosal lining.\\nA lot of the microbiota\\nspecies can start to die off.\\nAnd so it was surprising to\\nme, but nonetheless interesting\\nthat fasting may actually\\ncause a disruption\\nto certain healthy elements\\nof the gut microbiome.\\nBut again, there's a caveat.\\nThe caveat is that when people\\neat after a period of fast,\\nthere may be a compensatory proliferation,\\nmeaning an increase in\\nhealthy gut microbiota.\\nSo you start to get the picture\\nthat fasting is neither good nor bad.\\nYou start to get the picture\\nthat particular diets,\\nmeaning certain restriction diets\\nor macronutrient-rich diets\\nmay not be good or bad\\nfor the microbiome.\\nAnd yet there are some\\nanswers that arrive to us\\nfrom Dr. Sonnenburg, but from\\nother experts in the field,\\nthat there are certain foods\\nand certain things that we can ingest\\nwhich definitely enhance the microbiome\\nand make it healthier than it would be\\nwere we to not ingest those foods.\\nSo next I'd like to\\ntalk about what I think\\nis a really pioneering and\\nimportant study in this area.\\nThis is a study that was carried\\nout by the Sonnenburg lab\\nin collaboration with Chris\\nGardner's lab, also at Stanford,\\nwhere they compared two general\\ntypes of diets in humans,\\ndiets that were fiber rich,\\nwhich has been proposed\\ntime and time again\\nto enhance microbiota diversity\\nand to enhance gut-brain signaling even\\nand to enhance the immune system perhaps,\\nand diets that were enriched\\nin so-called low-sugar fermented foods.\\nBefore I dive into that study\\nand what the conclusions were\\nbecause they are very interesting\\nand very actionable for all of us,\\nI do want to touch on probiotics\\nbecause I want to avoid confusion.\\nIt is not the case that\\ningestion of probiotics\\nwill always lead to brain fog.\\nI want to make that clear.\\nIt is the case that\\ningestion of probiotics,\\neven if those probiotics\\ndon't directly contain\\nthe microbiota species that\\none is trying to proliferate,\\ncan be useful for improving\\nmicrobiotal diversity.\\nIn general, it seems that maintaining\\na healthy gut microbiome\\ninvolves ingesting certain types of foods,\\nand we'll talk about those in a moment,\\nbut perhaps also augmenting\\nthe microbiota system\\nthrough prebiotics or\\nprobiotics at a fairly low level\\non a consistent basis.\\nSo these are not high dose probiotics\\nexcept under conditions of dysbiosis\\nwhere, for instance, if somebody has done\\na round of antibiotics\\nand they need to replenish\\ntheir gut microbiome,\\nthere are foods and there are pill form\\nand powder form prebiotics and probiotics\\nthat can be very useful.\\nOr in cases where people\\nhave been very stressed\\nor are undergoing excessive travel\\nor have shifted their diet radically,\\nmaybe that's due to travel,\\nmaybe that's due to illness,\\nmaybe that's due to stress.\\nBut when there are a number\\nof different converging events\\nthat are stressing or depleting\\nmicrobiotal diversity,\\nthat's when at least I\\nbelieve it can be useful\\nto support the gut microbiome\\nthrough the ingestion of quality\\nprobiotics or prebiotics.\\nSo it would be under conditions\\nwhere people are stressed\\nor their system is generally stressed\\nfor environmental or\\nillness-related reasons\\nthat it might be useful to\\nlean towards higher doses\\nof prebiotics or probiotics\\nthan one might normally use\\nbut that under normal conditions,\\nthat one would focus on quality nutrients\\nthrough diet and focus on\\ningestion of probiotics\\nat a fairly low to moderate level,\\nand/or prebiotics at a\\nfairly low to moderate level.\\nThat just seems like the logical approach\\nbased on the experts that I've spoken to.\\nBut certainly if your doctor prescribes\\nor suggests that you take\\nhigh levels of probiotics\\nfor any reason,\\nyou should definitely pay\\nattention to your physician,\\nand you should obviously pay\\nattention to your physician\\nin any a case.\\nYou should never add or remove anything\\nfrom your nutritional plan\\nor supplementation plan\\nwithout consulting a physician.\\nSo what should we do in\\norder to maximize the health\\nof our gut-brain axis as it's called?\\nHow should we support the\\ndiversity of the good microbiota\\nthat help us create all\\nthese neurotransmitters\\nthat we want, improve our\\nimmune system function,\\nand so on and so forth?\\nWell, some of that is going\\nto be through the basics.\\nWhen I say the basics,\\nI mean the foundational\\nthings that really set us up\\nfor overall health.\\nSo this is going to be getting deep sleep\\nof sufficient duration 80\\nplus percent of the time.\\nI mean, if you could get a\\nhundred percent of the time,\\nthat'd be great but very\\nfew people accomplish that.\\nIt's going to be proper hydration.\\nIt's going to be proper\\nsocial interactions.\\nIt's going to be proper nutrition.\\nAnd we'll talk more about\\nnutrition in a moment.\\nIt's going to be limiting\\nexcessive, prolonged stressors or stress.\\nAnd indeed we've done episodes about,\\njust about all of those things\\nbut certainly about stress\\nwe have an episode of\\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast\\nthat you can find at hubermanlab.com\\nall about mastering stress,\\nhow to avoid long periods\\nof intense stress,\\nwhat to do to offset those.\\nGiven that stress can\\ndisrupt the microbiome,\\nwhether or not you're fasting or not,\\nthose tools ought to be useful.\\nNow, in what I consider\\nto be a landmark study\\nexploring the relationship\\nbetween the gut microbiome,\\nfood intake, and overall\\nhealth is this paper\\nfrom Justin Sonnenburg's\\nlab and Chris Gardner's lab,\\nboth of which are at Stanford.\\nAnd the paper entitled \\\"Gut\\nMicrobiome-Targeted Diets\\nModulate Human Immune Status\\\"\\nwas published in the journal \\\"Cell\\\",\\nwhich is among the three top\\njournals perhaps in the world,\\n\\\"Nature\\\", \\\"Science\\\", and \\\"Cell\\\"\\nreally being the apex\\njournals for overall science,\\nand especially for biomedical sciences.\\nNow, this is a very interesting study.\\nIt was done on humans.\\nThere were two major groups.\\nOne group of humans was\\ninstructed to increase\\nthe amount of fiber in their diet\\nand in fact ate a high fiber diet.\\nThe other group was instructed to eat\\na high fermented food diet.\\nNow, both groups started\\noff not having eaten\\na lot of fiber or a lot of fermented foods\\nand were told to increase\\nthe amount of either fiber\\nor fermented foods that\\nthey were ingesting\\nover a four-week ramp up period\\nand that was to avoid any\\nmajor gastric distress.\\nIt turns out that if you're\\nnot already accustomed\\nto eating a lot of fiber,\\nincreasing your amount\\nof fiber dramatically\\ncan cause some gastric distress\\nbut if you ease into it\\nover time, as we'll see,\\nthere's a mechanism behind this,\\nwhich was unveiled in this study,\\nbut if you ease into it over time,\\nthen the system can tolerate it.\\nLikewise high fermented foods\\ncan be readily tolerated\\nif there's a ramp up phase of ingesting\\nmaybe one serving a day,\\nthen maybe two servings,\\nand ramping up in this case\\nas high as six servings per day.\\nHowever, after this ramp up period,\\nthe group assigned to\\nthe high fiber condition\\nmaintained high fiber intake for six weeks\\nand the high fermented\\nfood group maintained\\nhigh fermented food intake for six weeks\\nafter which they went off\\neither the high fiber or\\nthe high fermented food diet\\nand there was a four-week follow up period\\nduring which they gradually\\nreturned to baseline.\\nThroughout the study their\\ngut microbiome was evaluated\\nfor the diversity of gut microbiota.\\nAnd there were also a number of measures\\nof immune system function,\\nin particular measures of\\nthe so-called inflammatome.\\nThe immune system has a lot of\\ndifferent molecules involved.\\nI did a whole episode\\nabout the immune system\\nif you're interested in learning\\nwhat some of those molecules are,\\nvarious cytokines and signaling molecules\\nthat reflect either\\nhigh inflammation states\\nor reduced inflammation\\nstates in the brain and body.\\nYou're welcome to check that episode.\\nIt's also at hubermanlab.com.\\nRegardless, in this study,\\nthey explored the sorts of immune markers\\nthat were expressed in\\neither of the two groups\\nand compared those.\\nThe basic takeaway of this paper\\nwas that contrary to what they predicted,\\nthe high fiber diet did not lead\\nto increased microbiota diversity,\\nat least not in all cases.\\nAnd that was somewhat surprising.\\nYou know, the idea is that prebiotic fiber\\nand a lot of the material\\nin fruits and vegetables\\nand grains and so forth\\nare supposed to support\\nmicrobiotal diversity\\nand the proliferation\\nof existing microbiota.\\nAnd that is not what they observed,\\nalthough I want to be\\nvery clear in pointing out\\nthat the results do\\nnot indicate that fiber\\nis not useful for health overall,\\nbut it does point to the fact\\nthat increasing fiber intake\\ndid not increase microbiota diversity,\\nwhich in general, as I mentioned before,\\nis associated with improvements\\nin microbiota function,\\nhealth, and overall wellbeing.\\nNow, the high fermented\\nfood diet condition\\nwas very interesting.\\nIt resulted in increased\\nmicrobiome diversity\\nand decrease inflammatory\\nsignals and activity.\\nSo there was a twofer.\\nBasically by ingesting\\nhigh fermented foods\\nin fair abundance, right?\\nYou know, four to six\\nservings or more per day\\nis a lot of fermented food intake.\\nWe'll talk about what\\nsome of those foods were.\\nBut the outcome was very positive.\\nThere was a clear increase\\nin microbiome diversity\\nand decreased inflammatory signals.\\nSo things like interleukin-6,\\na number of other\\ninterleukins and cytokines\\nthat are associated with\\nincreased inflammation\\nin the brain and body were\\nreduced significantly.\\nNow, let's talk a little\\nbit about this notion\\nof number of servings, et cetera.\\nOne somewhat minor point of the study,\\nbut I think is useful in terms\\nof taking an actionable stance with this\\nis that the number of\\nservings of fermented foods\\nwas not as strong a\\npredictor of improvements\\nin the inflammatome,\\nmeaning reduced inflammation\\nand improvements in microbiota diversity,\\nas was the duration of\\ntime that the individuals\\nwere ingesting fermented foods.\\nIn other words, the longer that one\\nis consistently ingesting\\nfermented foods on a daily basis,\\nthe better the outcomes in\\nterms of the gut microbiome\\nand for reducing inflammation.\\nSo I think that's an important point.\\nAnd I make that point,\\nespecially because for a lot of people,\\neven if you do this ramp up phase,\\nsix servings per day of fermented foods\\ncan seem like quite a lot.\\nSo what are these fermented foods?\\nI think many of us are\\nfamiliar with certain cheeses\\nand being fermented and\\nbeer being fermented\\nand kombucha is fermented.\\nIn this study, they focus specifically\\non low-sugar fermented foods.\\nSo this would be plain yogurt,\\nin some cases, kimchi or sauerkraut.\\nAn important consideration, however,\\nis that it needs to contain\\nwhat are called live active cultures,\\nwhich means there actually\\nhave to be microbiota\\nthat are alive inside the sauerkraut.\\nOne way you know whether\\nor not that's happening\\nis if you purchase sauerkraut\\nor pickles or kimchi\\nfrom a jar or a container\\nthat's on the non-refrigerated shelf\\nor the non-refrigerated\\nsection of your grocery store,\\nit is not going to contain\\nlive active cultures of microbiota.\\nAnd likewise, if you consume yogurt\\nthat has a lot of sugar or\\nother components added to it,\\nit's not going to have\\nthe same positive effect\\non the microbiome,\\nat least that's the prediction\\ngiven some of the relationship\\nbetween the sorts of\\nmicrobiota that live in sugar\\nversus plain type yogurts.\\nThey gave people the option of consuming\\nany number of different\\nlow-sugar fermented food.\\nSo that again that could\\nbe sauerkraut, kimchi,\\nthings like kefir, natto.\\nIn Japan, they consume natto\\nwhich is a fermented food.\\nBeer was not one of the fermented foods\\nthat was included in\\nthe fermented food list.\\nAnd when we say six servings per day,\\nthat is indeed six, six ounce servings,\\nor six, four to six ounce servings.\\nIt was not six servings of\\nwhat's listed on the package.\\nSo again, that turns\\nout to be a fair amount\\nof fermented foods.\\nHow should you gauge\\nwhether or not you're\\ngetting enough of this?\\nWell, if you decide to\\ntake on this protocol\\nof ingesting more fermented foods,\\nwhich at least by my read of this study\\nand some of the follow up\\nwork that's being done,\\nsounds like a terrific idea\\nif you want to improve your gut microbiome\\nfor all the great reasons\\nthat one would want to,\\nbrain-body health, reduced\\ninflammation, and on and on,\\nwell then you definitely want to focus\\non fermented foods that\\nyou enjoy consuming.\\nSo for you if that's kefir,\\nor for you that's plain yogurt,\\nor for you that's sauerkraut,\\nwhich happens to be my personal favorite,\\nthen you want to make sure\\nthat it's going to be something\\nthat you are going to enjoy\\ningesting quite a lot of\\nand that you're going to\\nbe okay with ingesting\\nprobably throughout the day.\\nNow, people follow different\\nmeal schedules, of course,\\nbut this does require not just eating\\nall the fermented foods just\\nbefore bedtime or at one meal.\\nI suppose you could do that,\\nbut in general, it's going\\nto work best in terms\\nof limiting gastric distress\\nby spreading it out throughout the day.\\nI also want to mention brine.\\nBrine is the liquid that\\nsurrounds sauerkraut.\\nIt's that very salty fluid.\\nAnd that contains a lot\\nof active live cultures.\\nAnd they did include or they\\nallowed people to include\\nbrine in this study.\\nAnd in discussions with Dr. Sonnenburg,\\nwhich we'll go into in\\nmore detail on the episode\\nthat comes out next week,\\nwe talk a lot about the particular value\\nthat brine might hold\\nin terms of bringing\\nabout microbiota diversity\\nbecause of the richness of\\nlive cultures that it contains.\\nI do want to focus for a moment\\non the high fiber condition\\nbecause there were some\\ninteresting observations\\nabout the people that were\\nplaced into that condition.\\nFirst of all, increasing\\nthe amount of fiber\\ndefinitely increased the number of enzymes\\nthat can be used to digest fiber.\\nThis is in keeping with this\\nidea of this ramp up phase\\nwhere accumulation of more fiber intake\\ncan over time lead to\\nless gastric distress\\nbut also to more utilization of fiber\\nwhich overall should be a good thing.\\nSo while they didn't observe an increase\\nin immune system function\\nor an increase in microbiota diversity,\\nthere was an increase in\\nthese fiber digesting enzymes.\\nThey also observed what they called\\npersonalized immune responses.\\nThere were some subgroups\\nwithin the high fiber group\\nthat had interesting changes in terms\\nof their reactions to, or I\\nshould say their inflammatome,\\nmeaning the inflammatory\\nmarkers they expressed,\\nas well as their microbiota diversity.\\nSo there were essentially three groups.\\nOne group actually showed an increase\\nin inflammatory markers.\\nSo that was quite surprising\\nand probably not wonderful for the message\\nthat fiber is always good for us\\nbut that was a small cohort\\nwithin the fiber intake group.\\nAnother group and still another group,\\nboth showed reductions in\\nbaseline microbiota diversity\\nalthough to varying degrees.\\nSo I don't want to paint the\\npicture that fiber is bad\\nbut fiber certainly did not\\nhave the positive effects\\non microbiota diversity\\nthat the high fermented food diet did.\\nSo my read of this study,\\nand I think the stance\\nthat many others have taken\\nas a consequence of these data,\\nis that we should be increasing\\nour fermented food intake,\\nthat that's simply a good\\nthing to do in order to support\\nour gut microbiome and to\\nreduce inflammatory signals\\nin our brain and body.\\nAnd there are a number of\\ndifferent ways to do that.\\nI mentioned some of the particular foods.\\nHowever, anytime you're talking\\nabout ingesting fermented foods,\\nespecially the high quality ones\\nthat come from the refrigerated section\\nof the grocery store,\\nand that have low sugar\\ncontent, et cetera,\\nwe do have to be considerate of cost\\nbecause certain things like\\nkombuchas, for instance,\\ncan be quite costly.\\nI should also mention some kombuchas\\nactually contain alcohol, some do not,\\nor contain very little amounts of alcohol.\\nOne way to avoid the high\\ncost of fermented foods\\nwhile still being able to accumulate\\na lot of fermented food intake\\nis to simply make those\\nfermented foods yourself.\\nAnd this is something that\\nwe've started exploring\\nand experimenting with in our home.\\nOne simple way to do this\\nis to just make your own sauerkraut.\\nIt involves very few ingredients.\\nIt basically involves\\ncabbage, water, and salt,\\nbut there's a specific process\\nthat you need to follow\\nin order to create these large\\nvolumes of sauerkraut at home\\nusing that low cost method.\\nThe best resource that I know of\\nin order to follow a great recipe\\nto make homemade sauerkraut\\nwould be the recipe\\nfor homemade sauerkraut that's contained\\nin Tim Ferriss's book, \\\"The 4-Hour Chef\\\".\\nThere's an excellent protocol there.\\nIt involves chopping up the\\ncabbage, putting into a bowl,\\nmashing it up with your hands,\\nwhich can be fun,\\nputting water in there,\\nsome salt, covering it,\\nand then keeping it in a\\nparticular environment,\\nand then routinely scraping off\\nsome of the material from the surface.\\nYou have to do that in order to make sure\\nthat you're not getting\\nmicrobes and things\\ngrowing in it that are bad for you.\\nSo you definitely want\\nto pay careful attention\\nto the protocol, but that's\\na very, very low cost way\\nof generating lots and\\nlots of fermented foods\\nso you don't go broke trying\\nto improve your microbiome.\\nThe other thing that you can do\\nif you're really obsessed with kombucha\\nor something like that, to\\navoid the high cost of kombucha\\nis there are ways that\\nyou can get the scoby,\\nwhich basically allows you to make\\nyour own kombucha at home.\\nI've never tried this,\\nbut when I was a post doc,\\nthere was an undergraduate in the lab,\\nI think, well, I won't out him,\\nbut he's now gone on to medical school\\nand I think he's passed his residency\\nand is a practicing doctor,\\nbut nonetheless, he was always\\nmaking kombucha at home.\\nHe told me it was exceedingly\\neasy, but then again,\\nhe had a number of other\\nskills and attributes\\nthat made me think that he could do\\npretty much anything with ease,\\nwhereas I tend to struggle\\nwith even basic cooking.\\nSo maybe if you're feeling\\na little more adventurous,\\nyou could explore making\\nyour own kombucha.\\nBut there are a number of\\ndifferent protocols and recipes\\nout there for making your own\\nlow-sugar fermented foods.\\nSo you needn't run out\\nand buy fresh sauerkraut\\nall the time.\\nI should also mention for those\\nof you that are interested\\nin getting your fermented\\nintake from pickles,\\njarred pickles rarely\\nif ever contain ferment.\\nMostly they're just\\nsoaked in vinegar, water,\\nand with some spices,\\nbut there are some that contain ferment.\\nYou actually have to look\\nfor that on the container.\\nAnd I don't know, maybe someone out there\\nknows how to make natto and\\nknows how to make kimchi well\\nand things of that sort.\\nIt certainly is the case based\\non the data from the study\\nthat ingesting more servings\\nof fermented food per day\\nought to be beneficial\\nfor our gut microbiome.\\nAnd since this is an episode\\nnot just about gut microbiome\\nbut gut-brain health,\\nI should mention that\\none form of signaling\\nbetween the gut microbiome and the brain\\nwhich we did not discuss\\nand I'll just touch on briefly\\nis that when the inflammatome\\nor the genes and markers\\nof inflammation are\\nkept in a healthy range,\\nthere's an active signaling\\nof that immune system status\\nto the brain.\\nThere's an intermediate\\ncell type that communicates\\nimmune status to the brain.\\nAnd that cell type is the microglial cell.\\nIt's a type of glia as the name suggests.\\nWhen there's a lot of\\ninflammation in the body,\\nthese microglia actually get activated\\nand can start eating away\\nat various components\\nof the brain and nervous system.\\nAnd I don't mean massive eating away.\\nThey're not going to\\ndigest the whole brain\\nbut these microglia are sort\\nof the resident macrophages\\nof the brain.\\nMacrophages are in the periphery\\nand they gobble up debris\\nand things of that sort.\\nThe microglia on a regular\\nbasis are eating up debris\\nthat accumulates across waking cycles\\nand in response to\\nmicro-damage to the brain\\nthat occurs on a daily basis.\\nSo they have a lot of\\nimportant basic everyday\\nwhat we call housekeeping functions.\\nBut when there's a lot of\\ninflammation in the body,\\nwhen there's a massive immune response,\\nthe microglia can be hyperactivated\\nand that's thought to lead to any number\\nof different cognitive defects\\nor challenges thinking,\\nor maybe even some forms of\\nneurodegeneration over time,\\nalthough that last point\\nis more of a hypothesis\\nthan a well tamped down\\nfact at this point.\\nThere's still a lot of\\ninvestigation to be done in humans.\\nThe animal data, however,\\nare very, very strong\\nthat when the immune system is activated\\nor chronically activated or hyperactivated\\nthat neural tissue, meaning brain tissue\\nand other central nervous\\nsystem tissue can suffer.\\nSo there are a lot of reasons to want\\nto not just improve microbiome diversity,\\nbut to also improve immune system function\\nand to limit the number\\nof inflammatory markers\\nthat are present in the body\\nbecause of the way those\\ninflammatory markers\\ncan signal deleterious\\nevents in the brain.\\nAnd while eating fermented foods\\nand making your own fermented foods\\nand buying high quality fermented foods\\nmight seem like an inconvenience,\\nI would say that from the perspective\\nof cost-benefit or effort-benefit,\\nit's actually quite a good situation\\nwhere if you can just ramp up\\nthe number of fermented foods\\nor servings of fermented foods\\nthat you're eating per day\\nover a period of a few weeks\\nso that you're tolerating that well,\\nthat ought to have a very positive effect\\non your microbiome diversity\\nand indeed on gut-brain function.\\nAnd I'll be the last to suggest\\nthat people completely forego on fiber.\\nI think there's some debate out there\\nas to how much fiber we\\nneed and whether or not\\ncertain forms of fiber\\nare better than others.\\nI'm not going to get into that debate.\\nIt's barbed wire enough without\\nme injecting my own views\\ninto that debate.\\nBut I think there's ample\\nevidence to support the fact\\nthat for most people ingesting\\na fair amount of fiber\\nis going to be a good idea.\\nI would just say that\\nmake sure that you're also\\ningesting a fair amount\\nof fermented foods.\\nAnd along the lines of fiber,\\nin an accompanying article\\npublished in \\\"Cell\\\",\\nwhich was sort of a what we\\ncall a news and views piece\\nabout the Sonnenburg and Gardner paper,\\nthey make a quite good point,\\nwhich is that the increase in fiber intake\\nthat led to the increase in\\ncarbohydrate active enzymes,\\nthese CAZymes as they're called,\\nthese are enzymes that help digest fiber,\\nquote, \\\"indicating an enhanced\\ncapacity for the microbiome\\nto degrade complex carbohydrates\\npresent in fibrous foods\\\".\\nSo in other words, eating\\nmore fiber and fibrous foods\\nallowed for an increase in these enzymes\\nthat allow you to eat\\nstill more fibrous foods\\nor to better digest fibrous\\nfoods that are coming in\\nthrough other sources.\\nSo there is at least one\\nutility for increasing fiber\\neven though it's separate from\\nthe gut microbiotal diversity\\nand reducing inflammation.\\nAnd I'd be remiss if I didn't\\ntouch on some of the data\\nand controversy about\\nartificial sweeteners\\nand the gut microbiome.\\nI want to be very clear that\\nwhat I'm about to tell you\\nhas only been established\\nin animal models,\\nin a mouse model, at\\nleast to my knowledge.\\nWhat the studies have shown,\\nand there were several,\\nbut one published in the journal \\\"Nature\\\"\\na few years back is the one\\nthat got the most amount of attention\\nis that animals that consume large amounts\\nof artificial sweeteners.\\nin particular things like\\nsaccharin or sucralose\\nshow disruptions in their gut microbiome.\\nI'm not aware of any studies in humans\\nthat show the equivalent effect.\\nAnd I'm not aware of any\\nstudies in humans that show\\nthe equivalent effect for things\\nlike plant-based, low-calorie sweeteners,\\nthings like Stevia, monk\\nfruit, and things of that sort.\\nAnd at least by my exploration,\\nI couldn't find any data specifically\\nrelated to the sweetener aspartame.\\nSo right now it's somewhat controversial\\nand actually this is kind of\\na third rail topic out there.\\nWhen one group will come out saying\\nthat artificial sweeteners are bad\\nbecause they disrupt the gut microbiome,\\nthe response generally from\\na number of people as well,\\nthat's only been shown in animal models.\\nAnd indeed that's true.\\nSo right now I don't think\\nthat there's a strong case\\none way or the other.\\nI think that people should\\nbasically ask themselves\\nwhether or not they like\\nartificial sweeteners or not,\\nwhether or not they're\\nwilling to risk it or not,\\nand obviously that's an individual choice.\\nI also want to point out a recent study\\nfrom Diego Bohorquez's lab,\\nwhich actually shows, however,\\nthat neurons in the gut,\\nthose neuropod cells, are\\nactually capable of distinguishing\\nbetween real sugars and\\nartificial sweeteners.\\nThis is a really interesting body of work.\\nIt was published just now, just recently,\\nI should say, February 2022.\\nThe title of the paper is\\n\\\"The Preference for Sugar\\nover Sweetener Depends\\non a Gut Sensor Cell\\\".\\nAnd to make a long story short,\\nwhat they showed was there's\\na category of neuropod cells\\nthat recognize sugar in the\\ngut and signal that information\\nabout the presence of sugar\\nin the gut to the brain\\nvia the pathways we talked about before,\\nthe nodose ganglia, the vagus, dopamine,\\net cetera, et cetera.\\nInterestingly, the very\\nsame category of neurons\\ncan respond to artificial sweeteners\\nand signal that information to the brain,\\nbut the pattern of signaling\\nand indeed the signature pattern\\nthat is conveyed to the brain\\nand received by the brain\\nis actually quite a bit different\\nwhen these same neurons are responding\\nto artificial sweeteners\\nversus actual sugar.\\nAnd this is very interesting\\nbecause what it means\\nis first of all that neurons\\nhave incredible specificity\\nin terms of what they are\\nsignaling from the gut\\nto the brain.\\nAnd it also means that there\\nmay be a particular signal\\nthat the brain receives that says\\nI'm receiving some intake of food or drink\\nthat tastes sweet but doesn't\\nactually offer much nutrients\\nin the direction of sweetness,\\nmeaning that it doesn't have\\ncalories despite being sweet.\\nNow, again, this is all\\nsubconscious processing.\\nAnd like with the previous studies\\nwe were just discussing\\nabout artificial sweeteners\\ngenerally and the gut\\nmicrobiome generally,\\nit's unclear how this relates to humans\\nat this point in time.\\nBut given the similarity\\nof cellular processes\\nand molecular processes at the\\nlevel of gut-brain in mice,\\nI think it stands to reason\\nthat these neuropod cells\\nvery likely are capable of\\nsignaling sweet presence\\nof real sweetener versus\\nartificial sweetener\\nin humans as well,\\nalthough that still remains\\nto be determined empirically.\\nSo I'd like to just briefly\\nrecap what I've covered today.\\nI started off by talking about\\nthe structure and function\\nof the gut-brain axis.\\nI described the basic\\nstructure and function\\nof the digestive pathway,\\nand how that digestive pathway\\nharbors microbiotal species,\\nmeaning many, many little\\nbacteria that can signal\\nall sorts of things to the\\nrest of the brain and body.\\nAnd indeed, we talked about\\nthe various ways they do that.\\nWe talked about direct pathways,\\nliterally nerve networks\\nthat extend from the gut\\nup to the brain and from\\nthe brain back to the gut.\\nAnd we talked about indirect pathways,\\nhow some of the gut microbiota\\ncan actually synthesize\\nneurotransmitters that get\\nout into the bloodstream,\\ncan impact the body,\\ncan impact the immune system,\\nand can get into the brain\\nand act as neurotransmitters\\nin the brain just as\\nwould neurotransmitters\\nthat originate from within the brain.\\nWe also talked about what constitutes\\na healthy versus unhealthy microbiome.\\nAnd it's very clear that\\nhaving a diverse microbiome\\nis healthier than having\\na non-diverse microbiome.\\nBut as I pointed out,\\nthere's still a lot of\\nquestions as to exactly\\nwhat microbiota species\\nyou want to enhance\\nand which ones you want\\nto suppress in the gut\\nin order to achieve the best\\ngut-brain axis function.\\nWe talked about how things\\nlike fasting might impact\\nthe microbiome and how\\nsome of that might be\\na little bit counterintuitive\\nbased on some of the other\\npositive effects of fasting,\\nor if we're not just discussing fasting,\\nsome other types of\\nsomewhat restrictive diets\\neither restrictive in time or restrictive\\nin terms of macronutrient intake,\\nhow those may or may\\nnot improve the health\\nof gut microbiome.\\nAnd the basic takeaway was\\nthat because we don't know\\nexactly how specific diets\\nimpact the gut microbiome,\\nand we don't know how fasting\\neither promotes or\\ndegrades the microbiome,\\nwe really can't say whether\\nor not they are improving\\nor degrading the microbiome at this time.\\nHowever, it is clear that stress,\\nin particular chronic stress,\\ncan disrupt the gut microbiome.\\nIt's also clear, of course,\\nthat antibiotics can\\ndisrupt the gut microbiome.\\nAnd that brings us to the topic\\nof prebiotics and probiotics.\\nAnd I emphasized the fact\\nthat for most people,\\ningesting high quality non-processed foods\\nthat includes some prebiotic fiber\\nbut also that includes some probiotics\\nwill probably be healthy\\nbut not excessive levels of probiotics.\\nHigh levels of supplemented probiotics\\nof the sort that would\\ncome in a probiotic pill\\nor even prescription probiotics\\nwould probably lend\\nthemselves best to when people\\nwere under severe chronic stress\\nor had just come off a serious round\\nor an ongoing or repeated\\nrounds of antibiotics.\\nThat does not mean that\\ningesting probiotics\\nin any form or any kind is not good.\\nIt just means that the\\nvery high dose probiotics,\\nagain, typically found\\nin prescription form\\nor capsule pill form\\nprobably are best reserved\\nto cases where of course\\nyour doctor prescribes them.\\nYou should always follow\\nyour doctor's advice.\\nBut in cases where\\nperhaps you are jetlagged,\\nyou're traveling\\nexcessively for any reason,\\nor working excessively,\\nyou're not getting enough sleep,\\nor your diet is radically\\nchanged from normal.\\nAnd we talked about how\\nincreasing the amount of fiber\\nin your diet might be\\nuseful for increasing\\nfiber digesting enzymes\\nand the assimilation\\nof fibrous foods\\nbut that it's really the\\ningestion of fermented foods\\nand, in fact, getting anywhere from four\\nor even up to six servings\\na day of fermented foods\\ncan be immensely beneficial for reducing\\ninflammatory markers in the body\\nand for improving microbiota diversity\\nall along the gut and\\nthereby improving signaling\\nand outcomes along the gut-brain axis.\\nSo we went all the way\\nfrom structure to function\\nto the four kinds of signaling,\\nmechanical, chemical, indirect, direct,\\nprobiotics, fiber, and fermented foods.\\nAnd I tossed in a little\\nbit at the end there also\\nabout ways that you can make\\nyour own fermented foods\\nat home in order to try and\\noffset some of the costs.\\nAlso, it's just kind of fun to do.\\nAnd some of those\\nactually taste quite good.\\nI've actually found that\\nthe fermented sauerkraut\\nthat we're making at home actually rivals\\nthe sauerkraut that you can buy\\nout of the refrigerated\\nsection at the grocery store.\\nAnd I am by no means\\na skilled cook or chef\\nand basically have no\\nculinary skill whatsoever.\\nSo if I can do it, you can do it.\\nI hope you found this information useful\\nand perhaps also actionable.\\nOne of my motivations\\nfor doing this episode\\nwas, again, as a primer for the episode\\nwith Dr. Justin Sonnenburg\\nwhere we go really deep\\ninto the gut microbiome,\\nless so into the gut-brain axis,\\nbut really deep into the gut microbiome,\\nwhat it is, what it\\ndoes, what it doesn't do,\\nand some of the emerging\\nfindings from his lab\\nthat are yet to be published.\\nAnd I also was excited to do this episode\\nbecause I think many of us have heard\\nabout the gut microbiome.\\nWe hear about these bacteria\\nthat live in our gut.\\nWe hear about the gut-brain axis\\nor that 90% or more of\\nthe serotonin that we make\\nis made in our gut.\\nWe hear about the gut as a\\nsecond brain and so forth.\\nBut I think for many people,\\nthey don't really have a clear picture\\nof what the gut microbiome is\\nand the pathways and mechanisms\\nby which it can signal\\nto the brain and to the\\nother parts of the body.\\nSo I hope that today's\\ninformation at least improved\\nthe clarity around that topic\\nand leaves you with a more vivid picture\\nof this incredible system\\nthat is our gut-brain axis.\\nIf you're enjoying and/or\\nlearning from this podcast,\\nplease subscribe to our YouTube channel.\\nThat's a

sleep,\\nand we're also going to talk about\\nthe mirror image of sleep,\\nwhich is wakefulness.\\nNow, these two phases of our life,\\nsleep and wakefulness,\\ngovern everything about our\\nmental and physical health,\\nand we're not just gonna talk about\\nwhat's useful about sleep,\\nwe're also gonna talk about\\nhow to get better at sleeping,\\nand that will include how to\\nget better at falling asleep,\\ntiming your sleep, and\\naccessing better sleep quality.\\nIn doing so, we're also gonna discuss\\nhow to get more focused\\nand alert in wakefulness,\\nso because sleep and\\nwakefulness are related,\\nwe really can't have a\\nconversation about one\\nwithout the other.\\nNow, in keeping with this theme,\\nyou may catch a few\\nsnores in the background.\\nUnlike me, my bulldog, Costello,\\ncan fall asleep anywhere, anytime,\\nand he happens to be sleeping\\nover there in the corner,\\nso if you hear snoring,\\nthat's what that's about.\\nAs always, I wanna just\\nmention that this podcast\\nis part of my effort to bring\\nzero-cost-to-consumer public education\\nabout science and science-related tools,\\nit is unrelated to my\\nteaching and research roles\\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\\nToday's podcast is brought\\nto us by Helix mattresses,\\nhaving the proper sleep environment,\\nboth the environment you're sleeping in\\nand the object you're sleeping on,\\nis critically important to\\ngetting a good night's sleep.\\nHelix mattresses are a\\nlittle different than most\\nbecause they're matched to\\nyour specific sleep needs,\\nas well as whether or not\\nyou tend to run hot or cold\\nas you sleep through the night,\\nwhat position you sleep in, and so forth,\\nso if you go to their website,\\nthey have a quiz that you can take\\nthat matches you to\\nthe particular mattress\\nthat's gonna be best for your sleep needs.\\nI've always had a lot of trouble sleeping,\\nI'm one of these people\\nthat can fall asleep easily,\\nbut then I wake up\\nand I have a hard time\\ngetting back to sleep,\\nand once I switched to a Helix mattress\\nthat was precisely\\nmatched to my sleep needs,\\nI found I could sleep through the night,\\nwhich has made a tremendous\\ndifference for me.\\nIf you wanna try Helix mattresses,\\nyou can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,\\nand that will give you up to\\n$200 off on a mattress order,\\nas well as two pillows free\\nwith your mattress order,\\nand of course, having the proper pillows\\nis just as important as\\nhaving the proper mattress.\\nToday's podcast is also\\nbrought to us by Headspace,\\nHeadspace is a meditation app\\nthat teaches you how to meditate.\\nIt's fair to say that now there's\\na ton of research out there\\nin peer-reviewed journals\\nsupporting the fact that\\nmindfulness meditation\\ncan support mental and physical health,\\nbut many people find it hard to meditate,\\nin fact, I'm one of these people.\\nI started meditating in my teens,\\nbut then I would drop\\nit every few weeks or so\\nand then I'd get back to it\\nmaybe the following week or every year,\\nI just was not very regular\\nabout my meditation practice,\\nand then a few years ago I\\nwas flying a lot for work\\nand I was on JetBlue flights,\\nand they have Headspace as\\npart of the choice of things\\nthat you can watch on the TV screen,\\nand as I started\\nmeditating more regularly,\\nwhat I found is my sleep was better,\\nI would arrive feeling more rested,\\nit was just a tremendous effects\\non my work performance and\\nother aspects of my life.\\nIf you wanna try Headspace,\\nyou can go to headspace.com/specialoffer,\\nif you do that, you'll get one month\\nof all of Headspace's\\nmeditations for free,\\nthat's the best offer right now,\\nso if interested, go to\\nheadspace.com/specialoffer.\\nSo let's talk about sleep,\\nsleep is this incredible\\nperiod of our lives\\nwhere we are not conscious.\\nWe might dream, we might\\ntwitch, we might even wake up,\\nbut in sleep, we are only in relation\\nto things that are happening\\nwithin our brain and body.\\nOutside sensory experience, in most cases,\\ncan't really impact us,\\nand yet, sleep is this tremendously\\nimportant period of life\\nbecause it resets our ability\\nto be focused, alert,\\nand emotionally stable\\nin the wakeful period,\\nso we can't really talk\\nabout wakefulness, focus,\\nmotivation, mood, wellbeing\\nwithout thinking about sleep,\\nand that's why we're\\ndevoting this entire month\\nto the discussion about sleep.\\nNow, we also can't talk about\\nsleep and think about sleep\\nwithout thinking about wakefulness\\nbecause it turns out that\\nthe period that we call sleep\\nand the period we call wakefulness\\nare tethered to one another.\\nWhat we do in the waking state\\ndetermines when we fall asleep,\\nhow quickly we fall asleep,\\nwhether or not we stay asleep,\\nand how we feel when we\\nwake up the next day,\\nand today, we're going to talk mostly\\nabout how to get better at sleeping,\\nand the reason for starting\\nthe conversation that way\\nas opposed to just diving into\\na lot of biology about sleep,\\nis because first of all,\\nthere's a lot of information\\nout there already\\nabout the biology of sleep.\\nWe're gonna touch on a little bit of this,\\nthings like stages of\\nsleep and sleep spindles,\\nmelatonin, and dreaming,\\nbut I think that by now,\\nmost people are aware\\nthat getting a really good night's sleep\\non a consistent basis\\nis critically important,\\nbut most people don't know how to do that.\\nIn fact, I'm guessing that\\nvery few of you out there\\nare consistently getting\\nseven to nine hours\\nof really terrific sleep,\\nwaking up feeling rested\\nand like you're ready to attack the day,\\nand being able to go through the day\\nfeeling focused and alert\\nwithout dips in energy or focus,\\nso if you're like most\\npeople, which includes me,\\nyou have some challenges with sleep\\nat least every third or fifth night or so\\nand maybe even more often,\\nso we're really gonna go tool-heavy today\\nand talk about tools that\\ncan help you fall asleep,\\nsleep better, and emerge from\\nsleep feeling more rested,\\nand we're gonna do that by\\ngrounding our discussion of tools\\nin peer-reviewed studies,\\nmostly from the last 10 years,\\nalthough some even more recent than that,\\nand we're gonna start by\\ndiscussing what is sleep\\nand what governs the timing\\nof the onset of sleep,\\nin other words, what makes you get sleepy\\nat a particular time of day.\\nSo what determines how well we sleep\\nand the quality of our wakeful state?\\nTurns out that's governed by two forces,\\nthe first force is a chemical force,\\nit's called adenosine.\\nAdenosine is a molecule in\\nour nervous system and body\\nthat builds up the longer we are awake,\\nso if you've just slept for 8, or 9,\\nor 10 really deep, restful hours,\\nadenosine is gonna be very\\nlow in your brain and body.\\nIf, however, you've been awake\\nfor 10, 15, or more hours,\\nadenosine levels are\\ngoing to be much higher.\\nAdenosine creates a sort of\\nsleep drive or a sleep hunger,\\nand actually, hunger is\\nthe appropriate word here\\nbecause for most of what\\nwe're gonna discuss today,\\nwe can think of it in an\\nanalogous way to nutrition.\\nYour nutrition and how well you feel\\nafter you eat certain foods,\\nyour overall level of fitness\\nand your cellular health\\nand your heart health\\nisn't governed by any one food item\\nthat you might eat or not eat,\\nit's governed by a number\\nof different factors,\\nhow often you eat, how much you eat,\\nwhich items you eat, et cetera,\\nand what works best for you.\\nIn the same way, your\\nsleep and your wakefulness\\nare the product of kind of the average\\nof a number of different behaviors,\\nhow long you've been awake is a key one\\nbecause of this molecule, adenosine.\\nSo the reason you get sleepy\\nwhen you've been up for a while\\nis because adenosine\\nis creeping up steadily\\nthe longer you've been awake,\\nand a good way to remember\\nthis and think about adenosine\\nis to think about caffeine.\\nCaffeine, for most people,\\nexcept a very small percentage of people,\\nwakes them up, it makes\\nthem feel more alert,\\nin fact, some people are\\nso sensitive to caffeine\\nthat they feel jittery if they drink it\\neven in small amounts,\\nother people can drink\\nlarge amounts of caffeine\\nand not feel jittery at all.\\nCaffeine acts as an adenosine antagonist,\\nwhat that means is that\\nwhen you ingest caffeine,\\nwhether or not it's coffee or soda or tea,\\nor in any other form,\\nit binds to the adenosine receptor,\\nit sort of parks there just like a car\\nwould park in a given parking slot,\\nand therefore, adenosine\\ncan't park in that slot.\\nNow, when caffeine parks in\\nthe adenosine receptor slot,\\nnothing really happens\\ndownstream of that receptor,\\nthe receptor can't engage\\nthe normal cellular\\nfunctions of making that cell\\nand you feel sleepy.\\nSo the reason caffeine wakes you up\\nis because it blocks\\nthe sleepiness receptor,\\nit blocks the sleepy signal,\\nand this is why when\\nthat caffeine wears off,\\nadenosine will bind to that receptor,\\nsometimes with even greater,\\nwhat we call affinity,\\nand you feel the crash,\\nyou feel especially tired.\\nNow, I'm not here to demonize\\ncaffeine, I love caffeine,\\nand I drink it in the morning\\nand I drink it in the afternoon,\\nbut I'm one of these people\\nthat, either because of my tolerance\\nor because of some genetic variations\\nthat exist among people\\nin terms of their adenosine receptors,\\nI can drink caffeine\\nas late as 4:00 or 5:00\\np.m. in the evening\\nand still fall asleep just fine.\\nSome people can't have any caffeine at all\\nor can't have any caffeine past 11:00 a.m.\\nor else their sleep is totally disrupted.\\nAll of this has to do\\nwith the relationship\\nbetween adenosine and\\nthese adenosine receptors,\\ngenetic variation,\\nthings that are very hard to\\nfind out except experimentally,\\nmeaning each of you needs to decide\\nand figure out for yourselves\\nwhether or not you can tolerate caffeine\\nand at what times of day\\nyou can tolerate caffeine\\nin order to still fall asleep\\neasily and get good sleep,\\nso rather than demonize caffeine,\\nor say that everyone can\\ndrink caffeine until late,\\nyou need to figure out\\nwhat's right for you.\\nCaffeine has a lot of health benefits,\\nit also, for some people,\\ncan be problematic for health,\\nit can raise blood pressure, et cetera,\\ncaffeine increases this molecule\\nthat's a neuromodulator\\nthat we call dopamine,\\nwe discussed this in episode one,\\nwhich tends to make us\\nfeel good, motivated,\\nand give us energy\\nbecause, as you may have\\nlearned in episode one,\\ndopamine is related to\\nanother neuromodulator\\ncalled epinephrine, which gives us energy,\\nin fact, epinephrine\\nis made from dopamine.\\nSo let's just take a step back\\nand think about what we're talking about\\nwhen we're talking about sleepiness,\\nsleepiness is driven by\\nincreases in adenosine\\nthat happen naturally,\\ncaffeine prevents the adenosine\\nfrom having its action of making us sleepy\\nby blocking that receptor,\\nso it gives us energy and it\\nincreases our dopamine levels,\\nbut some people can't\\ntolerate caffeine very well,\\nother people can tolerate it just fine,\\nso you need to determine\\nthat experimentally.\\nAll the data say there's\\ntremendous variation,\\nand right now, the only\\nway that I'm aware of\\nfor you to decide whether or not\\ncaffeine is a good or a bad thing for you,\\nand whether or not you should ingest it\\nat a given time of day or at all\\nis really to figure that out on your own,\\nin fact, there's a small subset of people\\nthat can drink caffeine until very late\\nand they have no trouble falling asleep\\nbecause they actually have a mutant form\\nof the adenosine receptor,\\nso in keeping with the theme\\nof science and science-related tools,\\nthis is one of those cases\\nwhere I can't give you a\\none-size-fits-all prescription\\nexcept to say you need to\\nexperiment with caffeine\\nin a way that's safe for you\\nand explore that and figure\\nout what works for you,\\nand then stick with that.\\nOkay, so adenosine is\\ndriving this sleep hunger,\\nwhen adenosine is low,\\nit's like we're well-fed,\\nwe're not very hungry,\\nand when adenosine is high,\\nit's like we're fasted for a long time\\nand we tend to be very hungry,\\nso that when adenosine is high,\\nwe really wanna fall asleep.\\nIf you want, I'm not suggesting\\nyou do this experiment,\\nbut you can do it,\\nyou can stay up for four more hours\\nthan you're used to staying up\\nand you'll find that\\nyou're very, very sleepy.\\nThat's because adenosine is building up\\nat levels higher and higher\\nbecause you've been awake\\nfor those extra four hours.\\nHowever, if you've ever\\npulled an all-nighter,\\nyou'll notice something interesting,\\nas morning rolls around,\\nyou'll suddenly feel an increase\\nin your energy and alertness again,\\neven though adenosine has been building up\\nfor the entire night.\\nNow, why is that?\\nThe reason that is is because\\nthere's a second force\\nwhich is governing when you\\nsleep and when you're awake,\\nand that force is a\\nso-called circadian force,\\ncircadian means about a\\nday or about 24 hours,\\nand inside all of us is a clock\\nthat exists in your brain and my brain,\\nand the brain of every\\nanimal that we're aware of,\\nthat determines when we want to be sleepy\\nand when we want to be awake.\\nJust think about it,\\nwe don't go through the day\\nwanting to fall asleep every 30 minutes\\nand then feeling like we're wide awake,\\nour sleep and our period of sleepiness\\ntends to be condensed into one block,\\ntypically one 6- to 10-hour block,\\nalthough there's also variation\\nin terms of how much people want to sleep,\\nand we're going to discuss\\nhow you can diagnose\\nyour absolute sleep need\\nas well as how to recover\\nsleep that you've lost.\\nThat block of sleep\\nand when it falls within\\neach 24-hour cycle\\nis governed by a number\\nof different things,\\nbut the most powerful thing\\nthat's governing when\\nyou want to be asleep\\nand when you want to be awake is light,\\nand in particular, it's\\ngoverned by sunlight,\\nand I can't emphasize enough\\nhow important and how\\nactionable this relationship is\\nbetween light and when you want to sleep.\\nIt's quite simple on the face of it\\nand it's quite simple to resolve,\\nbut people tend to make a big mess\\nof this whole circadian\\nliterature, frankly,\\nso let's just break it\\ndown from the standpoint\\nof what's going on in your brain and body\\nas you go through one 24-hour day.\\nLet's start with waking,\\nso regardless of how\\nwell you slept at night\\nor whether or not you were up all night,\\nmost people tend to wake up\\nsometime around when the sun rises,\\nmaybe not right at sunrise,\\nbut within an hour or two\\nor maybe three of sunrise.\\nNow, I realize there\\nare night-shift workers\\nand there are people traveling\\nand experiencing jet lag\\nwhere this is not going to be the case,\\nwe are gonna deal with\\njet lag and shift work\\nat the end of this podcast,\\nbut for most people, we tend to wake up\\nabout the time that the\\nsun is rising or so,\\nand as we do that,\\nadenosine levels tend to\\nbe low if we've been asleep\\nfor reasons that you now understand,\\nand our system generates\\nan internal signal\\nthat is in the form of a hormone.\\nNow, I've talked a lot about\\nneuromodulators and neurotransmitters,\\nI haven't talked a lot about\\nhormones yet on this podcast.\\nThe definition of a hormone\\nis it's a substance,\\na chemical that's released\\nfrom one organ in your body\\nthat goes and acts on other\\norgans elsewhere in your body,\\nincluding your nervous system.\\nWhen you wake up in the morning,\\nyou wake up because a particular\\nhormone called cortisol\\nis released from your adrenal glands,\\nyour adrenal glands sit\\nright above your kidneys,\\nand there's a little pulse of cortisol.\\nThere's also a pulse of some,\\nand when I say a pulse,\\nI just mean the release of a little bit,\\nthere's also a pulse of\\nepinephrine, which is adrenaline,\\nfrom your adrenals and also in your brain,\\nand you feel awake.\\nNow, that pulse of cortisol\\nand adrenaline and epinephrine\\nmight come from your alarm clock,\\nit might come from you\\nnaturally waking up,\\nbut it tends to alert your\\nwhole system in your body\\nthat it's time to\\nincrease your heart rate,\\nit's time to start tensing your muscles,\\nit's time to start moving about.\\nIt's very important\\nthat that cortisol pulse\\ncome early in the day,\\nor at least, early in your\\nperiod of wakefulness,\\nI say that because some people\\nare waking up at 8:00 p.m.\\nand are sleeping all day,\\nbut it's very important\\nthat that pulse of cortisol\\noccur early in the day and\\nthat it happens all at once,\\nit sort of sets a rising tide\\nof cortisol in your system.\\nNow, many of you have\\nprobably heard about cortisol\\nin relation to stress,\\nand indeed, as we go through\\nour day and our life,\\ndifferent stressors, different\\nevents happen in our life\\nthat make us feel more alert.\\nSome of the more stressful ones\\nmight be looking at your credit card bill\\nand seeing what seems to\\nbe a fraudulent charge,\\nor looking at your phone\\nand suddenly seeing a text that something\\nyou thought was gonna\\nhappen at a particular time\\nis not gonna happen,\\nor you're running late,\\nthose will tend to increase norepinephrine\\nand epinephrine and\\nadrenaline in your system,\\nand if they're severe enough,\\nyou'll start getting\\nsome pulses of cortisol\\nreleased from your adrenals\\nthroughout the day,\\nbut there's this normal,\\nhealthy rising tide of cortisol\\nthat happens early in the day,\\nand I say healthy because it wakes you up,\\nit makes you feel alert,\\nand it makes you feel able\\nto move and wanting to move\\nand to go about your day\\nfor work, for exercise,\\nfor school, for social\\nrelations, et cetera.\\nSo when you wake up in the morning\\nis when that cortisol pulse takes off,\\nand something else important happens,\\na timer is set in your body\\nand in your nervous system\\nthat dictates when a different\\nhormone called melatonin,\\nwhich makes you sleepy,\\nwill be secreted from a\\nparticular brain region,\\nso let's talk about that.\\nWhen you wake up in the morning\\nand you experience that rise in cortisol,\\nthere's a timer that starts going,\\nand these are cellular timers\\nand they're dictated by the relation\\nbetween different organs in your body,\\nthat says to your brain and body\\nthat in about 12 to 14 hours,\\na different hormone, this\\nhormone we're calling melatonin,\\nwill be released from your pineal gland.\\nSo there's two mechanisms here,\\na wakefulness signal\\nand a sleepiness signal,\\nand the wakefulness signal\\ntriggers the onset of the timer\\nfor the sleepiness signal.\\nNow, that sleepiness signal\\nthat we call melatonin\\nthat's released from the pineal\\ncomes only from the pineal.\\nUnless you're taking exogenous melatonin,\\nyou're supplementing with melatonin,\\nthe only source of melatonin in your body\\nis going to be this pineal gland,\\nso let's talk about the\\npineal gland for a second.\\nThe pineal gland is a gland\\nthat sits kind of in the\\nlittle structure near,\\nfor the aficionados out there,\\nit's kind of near the fourth ventricle,\\nit's about the size of a pea,\\nDescartes, the philosopher,\\nsaid that the pineal was\\nthe seat of the soul,\\nhe said that because it's\\none of the few structures\\nin the human brain\\nthat there's only one of them,\\nyou know, most structures,\\nthere's one on either side of the brain,\\nso-called bihemispheric,\\nbut the pineal, there's only one.\\nI don't know anything about souls, really,\\ncertainly not the science of souls,\\nbut I think it's very unlikely\\nthat the pineal is the seat of the soul,\\nbut it is a very interesting organ\\nbecause it's the only organ in our body\\nthat releases melatonin,\\nand that melatonin makes us\\nsleepy and lets us fall asleep.\\nNow, I'm guessing that many\\nof you are probably asking,\\n\\\"Should I take melatonin?\\\"\\nMy personal bias on this is,\\nexcept in rare cases, no,\\nfor the following reason,\\nmelatonin has a second function,\\nwhich is that melatonin\\nalso suppresses the onset of puberty.\\nIn kids, and especially in babies,\\nmelatonin isn't just\\nreleased in the evening\\n12 to 16 hours after we wake,\\nmelatonin is released\\nchronically, or tonically,\\nthroughout the day and night,\\nand that chronic or tonic\\nrelease of melatonin\\nis known to suppress some\\nof the other hormones\\nin other regions of the brain\\nthat trigger the onset of puberty.\\nNow, if you or your child\\nhas been taking melatonin,\\ndon't freak out,\\nas always, any kind of supplement\\nor anything that you're going\\nto take or think about taking,\\nyou really need to\\nconsult with your doctor,\\nI've said this many times on this podcast\\nand it's in the show notes, et cetera,\\nbut before you remove anything\\nor add anything to what\\nyou're already doing,\\nplease do consult with a\\nhealthcare professional.\\nHowever, melatonin is known\\nto suppress the onset of puberty,\\nso much so that regular, cyclic,\\ncycled periods of melatonin\\nrelease from the pineal\\nreally correlate with the onset of puberty\\nand early adulthood,\\nmeaning as we start secreting\\nmelatonin only at night,\\nthat's also when we tend to\\ntransition out of puberty.\\nNow, there are a lot of\\nthings that correlate\\nin our nervous system,\\nso that doesn't necessarily\\nmean it controls it,\\nbut in this case we know,\\nbased on lots of data,\\nendocrinology and so forth,\\nthat melatonin suppresses\\nthe onset of puberty,\\nso supplementing melatonin\\ncould be problematic\\nfor that reason,\\nbut if you've already\\ngone through puberty,\\nit could also have some impact\\non other hormone systems in your body,\\nso that's why I personally\\ndon't like to use\\nmelatonin to fall asleep.\\nThere's another reason,\\nwhich is that melatonin\\nwill help you fall asleep\\nbut it won't help you stay asleep,\\nand many people who take melatonin\\nfind that they wake up\\nthree to five hours later\\nunable to fall back asleep.\\nPart of the reason for that might be\\nthat melatonin purchased at,\\nyou can buy it over the counter\\nin most areas of the world\\neven though it's a hormone,\\nwhich is a little unusual,\\nyou can't just go into a\\npharmacy, at least in the US,\\nand buy testosterone or\\ncortisol or estrogen,\\nyou need a prescription,\\nbut you can go buy melatonin\\nfor whatever reason,\\nI don't know the reasons\\nfor that legality,\\nbut it's been shown many times,\\nand now I'm borrowing from some items\\nthat were in Matt Walker's\\nbook, \\\"Why We Sleep,\\\"\\nwhere he stated there is evidence\\nthat, in commercially available melatonin,\\nthe amount of melatonin has\\nbeen tested for various brands,\\nit can range anywhere from being\\n15% of what's listed on the bottle,\\nokay, so if they list\\nthis as 100 milligrams,\\nit would be a tremendously high dose,\\nit turns out it's only 15 milligrams\\nin that particular pill or capsule,\\nor up to 400 times more than\\nwhat's listed on the bottle,\\nso it's completely unregulated,\\nand so for those of you taking melatonin,\\nI will discuss at the end of the podcast\\nsome other potential alternatives\\nthat are probably safer\\nand don't have these issues.\\nSo should you take melatonin?\\nMy personal bias is no,\\nbut for many people, they\\nfind that it does help them,\\nand so if you do find it helps you,\\nthen just consider what I'm saying\\nin light of the other\\npractices that you're doing\\nand talk to your healthcare professional.\\nOkay, so the rhythm of\\ncortisol and melatonin\\nis what we call endogenous,\\nit's happening in us all the time\\nwithout any external input,\\nin fact, if we were in complete darkness,\\nliving in a cave with no\\nartificial lights whatsoever,\\nor we were in complete brightness\\nwhere we never experienced any darkness,\\nthese rhythms of cortisol\\nand melatonin would continue,\\nyou would have a bump in\\ncortisol, or a pulse in cortisol,\\nthat would drop off with time,\\nand then melatonin would come\\nup about 12 to 14 hours later,\\nbut these endogenous systems of our body,\\nwhich are both hormonal and neural,\\nwere set so that external things\\ncould govern when they happen.\\nNow, this takes us back to\\nepisode one of the podcast\\nthat if you haven't listened to already,\\nyou might wanna listen to,\\nwhere we talked about sensation\\nand perception and all that,\\nI'm not gonna review it again here,\\nbut there's one particular sensory event,\\none particular influence\\non your nervous system\\nthat determines when that cortisol\\nis going to start to rise,\\nso if you were in complete darkness,\\nit would happen once per 24-hour cycle,\\nbut it would be somewhat\\nlater and later each day,\\nwhereas under normal circumstances,\\nwhat happens is you wake up,\\nand what happens when you wake up?\\nYou open your eyes.\\nWhen your open your eyes,\\nlight comes into your eyes.\\nNow, the way this system works\\nis that you have a particular\\nset of neurons in your eye,\\nthey're called retinal ganglion cells,\\nyou don't have to remember\\nthat if you don't want to,\\nbut these retinal ganglion\\ncells are brain neurons,\\nagain, the retina is just\\nthe one piece of your brain,\\nactually, two pieces because\\nmost of you have two retinas,\\nthat resides outside the skull, per se.\\nWhen light comes into the eye,\\nthere's a particular group\\nof retinal ganglion cells,\\nor type of retinal ganglion cells,\\nthat perceives a particular type of light\\nand communicates that to this clock\\nthat resides right above\\nthe roof of your mouth\\ncalled the suprachiasmatic nucleus, okay?\\nSo I know this can get\\na little complicated,\\nbut these retinal ganglion cells,\\nwhen you open your eyes, light comes in,\\nand an electrical signal is\\nsent to this central clock\\nwe call the suprachiasmatic nucleus,\\nand the suprachiasmatic\\nnucleus has connections\\nwith essentially every cell\\nand organ of your body.\\nNow, it's vitally important\\nthat we get light communicated\\nto this central clock\\nin order to time the cortisol\\nand melatonin properly,\\nand when I say properly, I\\ncan say that with confidence\\nbecause we know based on a lot of evidence\\nthat if you don't get\\nyour cortisol and melatonin rhythms right,\\nthere are tremendously\\nbroad and bad effects\\non cardiovascular health,\\ndementia, metabolic effects,\\nlearning, depression, dementia,\\nin fact, there're so many negative effects\\nassociated with getting this wrong\\nthat I don't wanna get\\ninto it in too much detail,\\nin fact, I feel like we've been bombarded\\nwith all this information about\\nhow we're not sleeping well,\\nwe're not sleeping at the right times,\\nwe're not sleeping enough,\\nto the point where people\\nnow have sleep anxiety,\\nif they can't sleep well for a night,\\nthey're feeling overwhelmed by that\\nand it's sort of now they're stressed\\nabout not being able to sleep\\nwhich is making it harder\\nto sleep, et cetera.\\nI really wanna focus on what we can do\\nto anchor these systems properly,\\nso let's think about what\\nhappens when we do this correctly\\nand how to do it correctly.\\nWhen we wake up, our eyes open,\\nnow, if we're in a dark room,\\nthere isn't enough light to\\ntrigger the correct timing\\nof this cortisol-melatonin\\nthing, these rhythms.\\nYou might say, \\\"Well, why\\nwon't any light do it?\\\"\\nWell, it turns out that\\nthese neurons in our eye\\nthat set the circadian clock\\nand then allow our circadian\\nclock to set all the clocks\\nof all the cells and organs\\nand tissues of our body\\nresponds best to a\\nparticular quality of light\\nand amount of light,\\nand those are the qualities\\nof light and amount of light\\nthat come from sunlight,\\nso these neurons, what\\nthey're really looking for,\\nalthough they don't have\\na mind of their own,\\nis the sun at what we\\ncall low solar angle,\\nthe eye and the nervous system\\ndon't know anything about\\nsunrises or sunsets,\\nit only knows the quality of light\\nthat comes in when the\\nsun is low in the sky,\\nthe system evolved so that\\nwhen the sun is low in the sky,\\nthere's a particular contrast\\nbetween yellows and blues\\nthat triggers the\\nactivation of these cells,\\nso if you wake up and\\nyou look at your phone\\nor your computer,\\nor you flip on a bunch\\nof artificial lights,\\nwill these cells be activated?\\nAnd the answer is, sort of,\\nthey'll be activated but\\nnot in the optimal way.\\nWhat you want to do is\\nget sunlight in your eyes\\nas close to waking as possible.\\nNow, I wanna be really clear about this\\nbecause I've talked about it\\non other podcasts when I was a guest\\nand I talked about it\\non my Instagram feed,\\nand there seemed to be the same questions\\ncoming up again and again,\\nthese neurons don't know sunlight, per se,\\nthey don't know sunrise or\\nsunset, for that matter,\\nthey don't know artificial\\nlight from sunlight,\\nwhat they respond best to,\\nhowever, is the quality\\nand amount of light\\nthat comes in when the\\nsun is low in the sky,\\nthat means that if you can\\nwatch the sunrise, great,\\nthat's perfect for triggering\\nactivation of these cells,\\nhowever, if you wake up a\\nfew hours after the sunrise,\\nwhich I tend to most days, personally,\\nyou still wanna get\\noutside and view sunlight,\\nyou don't need the sunlight\\nbeaming you directly in the eyes,\\nthere's a lot of photons, light energy,\\nthat's scattered from\\nsunlight at this time,\\nbut the key is to get that light energy,\\nfrom sunlight, ideally, into your eyes.\\nNow, I know many of\\nyou are already asking,\\n\\\"Well, I live in Scandinavia,\\\"\\nor, \\\"I can't get sunlight,\\n\\\"there's buildings around me,\\\" et cetera,\\nwe will get to all of that,\\nbut it's critically important\\nthat you get outside to get this light.\\nI had a discussion with\\na colleague of mine,\\nDr. Jamie Zeitzer, who's in\\nthe Department of Psychiatry\\nand Behavioral Sciences at Stanford,\\na world expert in this,\\nand he tells me that it's\\n50 times less effective\\nto view this sunlight through a window,\\nthrough a car windshield,\\nor through the side window of a car\\nthan it is to just get\\noutside with no sunglasses\\nand view light early in the day.\\nNow, if you can't see the sunrise,\\nlike I said, you can see this\\nwithin an hour or two of sunrise,\\nbut it has to be low solar angle,\\nonce the sun is overhead,\\nthe quality of light shifts\\nso that you miss this opportunity\\nto time the cortisol pulse,\\nand that turns out to\\nbe a bad thing to do,\\nyou really wanna time that\\ncortisol pulse properly\\nbecause, we'll get into this\\na little bit more later,\\nbut a late-shifted cortisol pulse,\\nin particular, a 9:00 p.m. or\\n8:00 p.m. increase in cortisol\\nis one of the consequences,\\nand maybe one of the causes,\\nof a lot of anxiety\\ndisorders and depression,\\nso it's kind of a chicken-egg thing,\\nwe don't know whether or\\nnot it's correlated with,\\nit's the cause, or the effect,\\nbut it's a signature of\\ndepression and anxiety disorder.\\nBringing that cortisol pulse\\nearlier in your wakeful period,\\nearlier in your day,\\nhas positive benefits\\nranging from blood pressure\\nto mental health, et cetera,\\nnot gonna list them all off\\nbecause there's just so many of them,\\nbut many, many positive things happen\\nwhen you are getting the\\ncortisol early in the day\\nfar away from your melatonin pulse.\\nOkay, so how long should you be outside?\\nWell, this is gonna vary tremendously\\nbecause some people live in environments\\nwhere it's very bright,\\nso let's say it's Colorado\\nin the middle of winter,\\nthere's a snowfield,\\nthere's no cloud cover,\\nand you walk outside,\\nthere's going to be so\\nmuch photon light energy\\narriving on your retina\\nthat it probably only\\ntakes 30 to 60 seconds\\nto trigger the central clock\\nand set your cortisol and\\nmelatonin rhythms properly\\nand get everything lined up nicely,\\nwhereas if you're in Scandinavia\\nin the depths of winter\\nand you wake up at 5:00 a.m.\\nand the sun is just barely\\ncreeping across the horizon\\nand then goes back down\\nagain a few hours later,\\nyou probably are not\\ngetting enough sunlight\\nin order to set these rhythms,\\nso many people find that they need to use\\nsunlight simulators in the\\nform of particular lights\\nthat were designed to simulate sunlight,\\nhowever, and I'm not out to attack\\nthe companies that produce those,\\nthere's another solution to that,\\nyou can simply go outside for longer,\\neven if there's a lot\\nof dense cloud cover,\\nyou're probably getting anywhere\\nfrom 10,000 to 50,000 lux,\\nL-U-X, which is just a\\nmeasure of light energy,\\nand that should be sufficient\\nto set the circadian clock.\\nYou could say, \\\"Well, the\\nlights in my house or my phone\\n\\\"are really, really bright, right?\\n\\\"Everyone's telling us to\\nstay off our phones at night\\n\\\"because they're really bright,\\\"\\nbut guess what, it turns\\nout that early in the day,\\nyour retina is not very sensitive,\\nwhich means you need a lot of photons,\\nideally coming from sunlight,\\nto set these clock mechanisms,\\nso looking at your phone or\\nartificial lights is fine\\nif you wake up before sunrise,\\nbut it's not going to work to\\nset these clock mechanisms,\\nand this is supported by\\ndozens, if not hundreds,\\nof quality peer-reviewed studies,\\nso you wanna use sunlight,\\nif you can't see sunlight\\nbecause of your environment,\\nthen you are going to have\\nto opt for artificial light,\\nand in that case, you're going\\nto want an artificial light\\nthat either simulates sunlight\\nor has a lot of blue light.\\nNow, without going off course here,\\nyou might be saying,\\n\\\"Wait, I've heard blue\\nlight is bad for me.\\\"\\nActually, blue light is\\ngreat for this mechanism\\nduring the day,\\nwe can talk about blue\\nlight and blue blockers,\\nbut you really want a lot\\nof blue and yellow light\\narriving on the retina early in the day.\\nLet me be clear about something,\\nyou never ever want to look at any light,\\nsunlight or artificial light,\\nthat is painful to look at.\\nIf you find that your eyes are watering\\nor you're having challenges maintaining,\\nyou know, looking at\\nthis thing for a while\\nbecause it's painful,\\nthat light is too bright\\nand you do not wanna damage your retina,\\nso you don't wanna gaze at\\nthe sun refusing to blink\\nand burn your retina, that's\\nactually possible to do,\\nyou don't wanna do that.\\nYou have a proper blink reflex\\ninstalled in you since birth,\\nand if you feel like\\nsomething's too bright\\nand you need to blink,\\nit means you need to blink,\\nthat it's too much light,\\nso please don't beam your\\neyes with really bright light,\\nbut blue light,\\nin particular, blue light and yellow light\\ncoming from sunlight is ideal,\\nif you're going to get\\nit from artificial light\\nbecause you can't get enough sunlight,\\nwell, then, artificial lights\\nthat are rich in blue, blue wavelengths,\\nare going to be ideal for\\nsetting this mechanism.\\nA lot of people will say, \\\"Oh, I should be\\n\\\"wearing blue blockers\\nthroughout the day.\\\"\\nNo, that's the exact wrong thing,\\nif you're going to use blue blockers,\\nwe can talk about that,\\nthat should be reserved\\nfor late in the evening\\nbecause light suppresses melatonin.\\nI've been asked many times\\nbefore about this pineal gland\\nand there are a lot of ancient practices\\nthat map to some of the\\nthings that I'm saying,\\nand people will always say,\\n\\\"Oh, I heard that sunlight\\n\\\"is great for the pineal.\\\"\\nWell, perhaps, but we have\\nto careful about that phrase,\\nsunlight inhibits the pineal,\\nit prevents it from releasing melatonin,\\ndarkness allows the pineal\\nto release melatonin,\\nso the pineal is not the gland\\nor the organ of sunlight,\\nit is the gland of darkness,\\nin fact, melatonin can be\\nthought of as a sleepiness signal\\nthat's correlated with darkness,\\nso get up each morning,\\ntry and get outside,\\nI know that can be challenging for people,\\nbut anywhere from 2 to 10\\nminutes of sunlight exposure\\nis going to work well for most people,\\nand you wanna do this on a regular basis\\nand you don't have to do\\nit exactly at sunrise,\\nI realize I'm repeating myself,\\nbut somehow, despite\\nbarking at people about this\\nfor a couple years now,\\nI keep getting the same questions,\\nand somehow, it hasn't been sinking in,\\nwhich could be related to\\nsome circadian disorder,\\nI'm just kidding, if it's not sinking in,\\nit's probably that I'm not being effective\\nin communicating the information,\\nbut get that bright light\\nearly in the day from sunlight,\\nand if you can't get it from sunlight,\\nget it from artificial light.\\nWhat kinds of artificial lights will work?\\nWell, there are these sunrise simulators,\\nbut the ring lights that\\npeople use for selfies\\nand this sort of thing,\\nfor posting on Instagram,\\nthose generate a lot of blue light.\\nIf wanna get experimental about this,\\nthere's a free app, I have\\nno relationship to the app,\\nbut it's a great app called Light Meter\\nthat you can use your phone\\nand you can measure the\\namount of photon energy\\nin your environment,\\nand it's kind of a fun experiment to do,\\nyou can go outside in the morning\\nand you'll see that\\nthere's 10,000, 20,000 lux,\\neven though it might\\nseem like it's kinda dim\\nor there's tree cover or cloud cover,\\nyou go inside and you\\nshine an artificial light\\nat your phone,\\npress the button on Light Meter\\nand you'll find that it's\\nonly 500 or 1,000 lux,\\nand you realize that even\\nthough it seems really bright,\\nthe artificial light is very condensed,\\nwhereas the outside light is\\nscattered in the atmosphere,\\nand so you can think that\\nyou're not getting much sunlight\\nbut you're actually\\ngetting much more outside,\\nso get outside, get that\\nsunlight early in the day,\\nand try and do it on a consistent basis.\\nIf you can't do it every day\\nor you sleep through this\\nperiod of the early day,\\nlow solar angle,\\ndon't worry about it,\\nthese systems in the body,\\nthese hormone systems and\\nneurotransmitter systems\\nthat make you awake at\\ncertain periods of the day\\nand sleepy at other times\\nare operating by averaging\\nwhen you view the brightest light.\\nNow, that can immediately tell us\\nthat what most people\\nare doing is terrible,\\nthey're waking up and they're\\nlooking at their phone,\\nwhich isn't triggering activation\\nof these cells in the eye\\nand the central circadian clock,\\nthen a few hours later,\\nthey might get in their car\\nwith sunglasses and drive.\\nNow, a note about sunglasses\\nand prescription lenses,\\nabsolutely never, ever,\\never compromise safety\\nfor the sorts of things I'm talking about,\\nso if you need to wear\\nsunglasses for safety reasons,\\nwear them,\\nabsolutely, if you wear\\nprescription lenses or contacts,\\nwear them, they won't filter\\nout the wavelengths of light\\nthat are necessary for\\nsetting these central clocks,\\nso safety first, of course,\\nif you have a retinal\\ndegenerative disorder,\\nretinitis pigmentosa, macular\\ndegeneration, or glaucoma,\\nor those run in your family,\\nyou want to avoid excessively\\nbright light all the time,\\nyou wanna be very cautious about that,\\nyou're going to wanna\\nget your light exposure\\nthrough seeing dimmer\\nlight, including sunlight,\\nbut for longer periods of time, perhaps.\\nYou might immediately ask,\\n\\\"What about low-vision or blind people,\\n\\\"how do they set these central clocks?\\\"\\nWell, turns out that\\nlow-vision and blind people,\\nmost of them, provided\\nthey still have eyes,\\nthat the eyes weren't removed\\nbecause of a burn or a tumor\\nor something like that,\\nstill maintain these neurons\\nthat set the circadian clock,\\nwhich brings me to a\\nreally important point,\\nit's not about seeing\\nand perceiving the sun,\\nthis is a subconscious mechanism\\nby which these neurons,\\nwhich are called\\nmelanopsin ganglion cells,\\nthese neurons set your central clocks\\nby getting activated by the\\nparticular wavelengths of light\\nthat are present in the atmosphere,\\neven coming through cloud cover,\\nand you don't need to\\nsee or perceive the sun\\nin order to get this mechanism to start.\\nNow, it's such a vitally\\nimportant mechanism\\nbecause it dictates how well\\nand what time you will want to\\nfall asleep later in the day,\\nso for those of you that are night owls\\nand you insist that you're a night owl\\nand you have the genetic polymorphism\\nthat makes you a night owl,\\nyou may very well have\\nthat genetic polymorphism,\\nthose genes that make\\nyou want to stay up late\\nand wake up late,\\nbut chances are, about half of you\\nthat think that you're night owls\\nare just not getting enough\\nsunlight early in the day.\\nSo viewing light early in\\nthe day, ideally sunlight,\\nis key for establishing\\nhealthy sleep-wake rhythms\\nand for allowing you to\\nfall asleep easily at night.\\nNow, it's not gonna make sure\\nthat all that happens every single time,\\nbut it is the foundation of proper sleep\\nand what we call circadian health,\\nit governs metabolism\\nand so many other things\\nthat are supposed to exist\\non a regular 24-hour cycle.\\nSome of you, many of you, might be asking,\\n\\\"What else can help set this rhythm?\\\"\\nWell, it turns out that light\\nis what we call the primary\\nzeitgeber, the time giver,\\nbut other things can help\\nestablish this rhythm of cortisol\\nfollowed by melatonin 12\\nto 16 hours later as well.\\nThe other things besides light\\nare timing of food intake,\\ntiming of exercise,\\nas well as various drugs or\\nchemicals that one might ingest,\\nnot illegal drugs,\\nalthough those will impact\\ncircadian mechanisms as well,\\nbut the reason we focus\\nso heavily on light\\nis that light is the main\\nway that this central clock,\\nthe suprachiasmatic nucleus,\\nwas supposed to be set,\\nand we know that because\\nit's the only direct input\\nto the clock.\\nThese neurons in the eye that\\nare also part of the brain\\nthat we call melanopsin ganglion cells\\nthat, not so incidentally, were discovered\\nby my friend and colleague David\\nBerson at Brown University,\\nand others, Samer Hattar,\\nKing-Wai Yau, et cetera,\\nworked out the mechanisms,\\nthe molecular mechanisms,\\nbut it was really David Berson\\nthat discovered these\\nincredibly fascinating,\\nyou know, these are cells that\\naren't important for sight\\nlike pattern vision,\\nbut are for setting our clocks,\\nDavid's really credited\\nwith making that discovery.\\nThose cells are the main way\\nand the only direct way to set the clock,\\nin fact, it's fair to say\\nthat light viewed by\\nthese melanopsin cells,\\nin particular, sunlight,\\nis 1,000 to 10,000 times more effective\\nthan, say, getting up in\\ndarkness and just exercising.\\nThat doesn't mean that you shouldn't\\nexercise early in the day in darkness\\nif that's what you like to do,\\nit will have somewhat an effect\\non raising your wakefulness\\nearly in the day\\nand setting these rhythms,\\nand this is because of\\nsome other pathways,\\nfor the aficionados out there\\nwho wanna know more neuroscience,\\nhere's how it goes, you've got this clock\\nabove the roof of your mouth\\nthat churns out this 24-hour rhythm\\nand it's communicated\\nto all the other organs\\nand tissues of your body,\\nbut there's another structure,\\nit has a cool name, it's called\\nthe intergeniculate leaflet,\\nwhich sits a few millimeters\\naway in the brain,\\nand it's involved in\\nregulating the clock output\\nthrough what's called non-photic,\\nnon-light-type influences\\nlike exercise and feeding, et cetera.\\nSo if you are not feeling\\nawake during the day\\nand you're having trouble sleeping,\\nget the sunlight exposure\\nthat we just talked about,\\nbut in addition to that,\\nif you wanna become an\\nearly riser, for instance,\\nand you wanna feel more awake\\nduring the early part of the day,\\nby getting that light exposure\\nand exercising early in the day,\\nyou will, after two or three days,\\nyou will naturally start to\\nwake up earlier in the day,\\nand that's because these\\nclock mechanisms have shifted,\\nit's like setting the clock earlier\\nas opposed to delaying the clock,\\nand that takes us to a\\nsomewhat complicated,\\nbut very important, aspect to all this,\\nwhich is, what sets the\\nclock and keeps it anchored?\\nThe main thing is that bright\\nlight early in the day,\\nthe other thing is sunset,\\nwhen the sun is also at low solar angle,\\nlow, close to the horizon,\\nby viewing sunlight at that\\ntime of day in the evening,\\nor afternoon, depending\\non what time of year it is\\nand where you are in the world,\\nthese melanopsin cells,\\nthese neurons in your eye,\\nsignal the central circadian clock\\nthat it's the end of the day,\\nand there's a really nice study\\nthat was published last year,\\nand I will put links to\\nthese references on a website\\nnot too long from now,\\nthere was a really nice study that showed\\nthat viewing sunlight around\\nthe time of the sunset,\\ndoesn't have to be just\\ncrossing the horizon,\\nbut circa sunset,\\nwithin an hour or so of sunset,\\nprevents some of the bad effects of light\\nin preventing melatonin\\nrelease later that same night,\\nso let me repeat this,\\nviewing light early in the day is key,\\nviewing light later in the day\\nwhen the sun is setting,\\nor around that time,\\ncan help protect these\\nmechanisms, your brain and body,\\nagainst the negative effects\\nof light later in the day,\\nso let me talk about you would do that,\\nyou'd go view the sunset\\nor you would go outside in\\nthe late afternoon or evening,\\nagain, if you safely can do that\\nwith sunglasses off, you will,\\nif you need to wear sunglasses, fine,\\nbut it will take probably\\n100 to 1,000 times longer\\nwith dark sunglasses than\\nif you take them off,\\nagain, if you wanna do this\\nthrough a window at work,\\nthat's fine, but it'll\\ntake 50 times longer,\\nso the best thing to do is\\njust to get outside for a few minutes,\\nanywhere from 2 to 10 minutes,\\nalso in the afternoon.\\nHaving those two signals\\narriving to your central clock\\nthat your body, your internal world,\\nknows when it's morning and\\nknows when it's evening,\\nis tremendously powerful.\\nMaybe think about it this way,\\nevery cell in your body\\nneeds glucose and energy,\\nit needs, whether or not\\nit gets that from meats\\nor it gets it from ketones or\\nit gets it from carbohydrates\\nor fruit or vegetables, it doesn't matter,\\nit is eventually converted\\ninto a certain form of energy\\nthat all your cells use,\\nbut you don't take glucose,\\nyou don't take bread or\\na steak or a nice orange\\nand shove it in your ear,\\nyou put it in your mouth,\\nit goes into your stomach, it's digested,\\nand then that resource is distributed\\nto all the cells of your body.\\nEvery cell in your body needs oxygen,\\nand you don't put a hose\\nyou know, through your\\nnostril or through your ear\\nor through some other\\norifice in your body,\\nyou inhale air and it's then\\ndistributed via the lungs\\nto the cells in your blood stream,\\nand then it's distributed to\\nall the organs of your body.\\nEvery cell and organ in your\\nbody needs light information,\\nand the way to get that light information\\nto all those cells,\\nbecause you have a thick skull\\nand the inside of you is\\ndark inside your skin,\\nthere's no sunlight getting in there,\\nis by viewing sunlight with your eyes\\nat the two times of day\\nthat I'm referring to, okay?\\nThat's the only route.\\nThere was a study published in \\\"Science,\\\"\\nan excellent journal,\\nwell over 10 years ago,\\nthat showed that light shone\\non the back of the knee\\ncould set these circadian rhythms,\\nthat study was retracted,\\nand unfortunately, most people don't know\\nthat it was retracted,\\nthere were some experimental flaws,\\nthat people were actually viewing light\\nthrough their eyes.\\nThat study was repeated,\\nturns out, there is no\\nextraocular photo reception in humans.\\nWhatever somebody tells you\\nthat light to the skin\\nor light to the wherever\\nis beneficial for your health,\\nwe can talk about that,\\nbut there's no way that light information\\nis setting your clocks,\\nyou need these cells in your eyes\\nto perceive or to see light\\nat the particular times of\\nday that I'm referring to.\\nSome animals, like snakes\\nand other reptiles,\\nactually have a hole in\\nthe top of their skull\\nto get light information\\ndirectly to their pineal\\nto suppress melatonin.\\nWe don't have that hole,\\nI mean, most of you don't\\nhave holes in your skull.\\nThese holes in your skull\\nthat we call the sockets for the eyes\\nare actually there primarily\\nto allow light information\\nto this central clock,\\nand then vision and pattern\\nvision and color vision\\ncame much later in evolution,\\nwe know this on the\\nbasis of genetic studies\\nwe get to discuss in a future podcast.\\nSo get that light information\\nto the cells of your brain and body\\nby viewing sunlight at\\nthe two times of day\\nthat I referred to.\\nThere's always a lot of questions about,\\n\\\"How long, how much, how do\\nI know if I've had enough?\\\"\\nYou'll know because your rhythm\\nwill start to fall into\\nsome degree of normalcy,\\nyou'll start to wake up\\nat more or less the same time each day,\\nyou'll fall asleep more easily at night,\\ngenerally, it takes\\nabout two or three days\\nfor these systems to align,\\nso if you've not been\\ndoing these behaviors,\\nit's gonna take a few days,\\nbut they can have tremendous benefits,\\nand sometimes rather quickly,\\non a number of different\\nmental and physical aspects\\nof your health.\\nNow let's talk about\\nthe bad effects of light\\nbecause light is not supposed\\nto arrive in our system\\nat any time,\\nand nowadays, because of\\nscreens and artificial light,\\nwe have access to light\\nat times of day and night\\nthat normally we wouldn't.\\nNow, earlier I said that\\nyou need a lot of light,\\nin particular, sunlight,\\nto set these clock mechanisms,\\nthat's true, but there's a\\nkind of diabolical feature\\nto the way all of this works,\\nwhich is the longer you've been awake,\\nthe more sensitive your retina\\nand these cells are to light,\\nso that if you've been\\nawake for 10, 12, 14 hours,\\nit becomes very easy for\\neven a small amount of light\\ncoming from a screen or\\nfrom an overhead light\\nto trigger the activation of the clock\\nand make you feel like\\nyou wanna stay up later,\\nmake it harder to fall asleep,\\nand disrupt your sleep pattern, okay?\\nSo the simple way to think about this is\\nyou want as much light\\nas is safely possible\\nearly in the day, morning\\nand throughout the day,\\nincluding blue light,\\nso take those blue\\nblockers off during the day\\nunless you have a real issue\\nwith screen light sensitivity,\\nand you want as little\\nlight coming into your eyes,\\nartificial or sunlight,\\nafter, say, 8:00 p.m.,\\nand certainly, you do not want to get\\nbright light exposure to your eyes\\nbetween 11:00 p.m. and\\n4:00 a.m., and here's why,\\nDavid Berson, who I mentioned before,\\nand another and friend and\\ncolleague, Samer Hattar,\\nwho's director of the chronobiology unit\\nat the National Institutes\\nof Mental Health\\npublished a paper in\\n\\\"Cell,\\\" which is a journal,\\nanother excellent journal,\\nvery high stringency,\\nshowing that light that\\narrives to the eyes\\nbetween 11:00 p.m. and\\n4:00 a.m., approximately,\\nsuppresses the release of dopamine,\\nthis neuromodulator\\nthat makes us feel good,\\nand it's sort of an\\nendogenous antidepressant,\\nand can inhibit learning\\nand create all sorts of\\nother detrimental effects,\\nit does this through a mechanism,\\nfor those of you that wanna\\nknow the neural pathways,\\nthat involves light to the eyes\\nthat's then signaled to a\\nstructure called the habenula,\\nthe habenula looks like\\ntwo little bat ears\\nsitting right in the middle\\nof a structure in your brain\\ncalled the thalamus,\\ndon't worry about these names\\nif you're not interested in this stuff,\\nif you are, these are\\njust avenues to explore,\\nwhen that habenula gets activated\\nit's actually called the\\ndisappointment nucleus\\nbecause it actually\\nmakes us feel less happy\\nand more disappointed,\\nand can lead to certain\\nforms of depression\\nin the wakeful state.\\nNow, if you wake up in\\nthe middle of the night\\nand you need to use the bathroom\\nor you're on an all-night flight\\nand you're, you know, need to\\nread or whatever it is, fine,\\nevery once in a while,\\nit's not gonna be a problem\\nto get bright light exposure to your eyes\\nin the middle of the night,\\nbut if you think about\\nour lifestyle nowadays\\nand being up late looking at phones,\\neven if you dim that screen,\\nyou're triggering this activation\\nbecause your retinal sensitivity\\nand the sensitivity of\\nthese neurons has gone up\\nlate in the day.\\nNow, I'm not here to dictate\\nwhat you should or shouldn't do,\\nbut for those of you that are\\nexperiencing challenges with mood,\\nthose of you that have anxiety,\\nlearning problems, issues focusing,\\nthe questions I usually get\\nare, \\\"How can I focus better?\\\"\\nWell, we will get to that,\\nbut one of the best ways you can support\\nyour mechanisms for good\\nmood, mental health,\\nlearning, focus, metabolism, et cetera,\\nis to take control of this\\nlight exposure behavior at night\\nand not get much or any\\nbright light exposure\\nin the middle of the night.\\nRed light won't trigger this pathway,\\nbut very few people have\\nthe kind of infrared lights\\nthat are set up, or floor lights,\\nand that brings me to an important point,\\nwhich is about the location of light,\\nthis hasn't been discussed\\nmuch out there, I don't think,\\nthese cells in our eye,\\nthese neurons that\\nsignal the central clock,\\nreside mostly, not\\nexclusively, but mostly,\\nin the bottom half of our retina,\\nand because we have a lens\\nin front of our retina,\\nand because of the optics of lenses,\\nthat means that these cells\\nare actually viewing\\nour upper visual field,\\nthere's an inversion of the\\nvisual image, et cetera,\\nyou can look that up\\nif you wanna learn more\\nabout retinal optics, it's fascinating,\\nbut not the topic for today.\\nThese cells are in the bottom\\nhalf of your retina mostly,\\nand so they're viewing the\\noverhead visual space around you.\\nThis is probably not\\ncoincidental that these cells\\nwere essentially designed\\nto detect sunlight,\\nwhich is overhead, of course,\\nso if you want to avoid\\nimproper activation of these neurons,\\nit's better to place lights\\nthat you use in the evening\\nlow in your physical environment,\\nso on desktops or even the\\nfloor, if you wanna go that way,\\nas opposed to overhead lights,\\nso overhead florescent\\nlights would be the worst,\\nthat would be the worst case scenario,\\nlights that are overhead\\nthat are a little bit softer,\\nof the sort or yellow or reddish tints,\\nwould be slightly better,\\nbut dim lights that\\nare set low in the room\\nare going to be best\\nbecause they aren't going\\nto activate these neurons\\nand therefore shift your circadian clock,\\nso that's a goal.\\nSome people, like Samer Hattar\\nthat I mentioned earlier,\\nhe turns his home basically\\ninto a cave in the evenings.\\nCandlelight actually does not\\ntrigger activation of these cells,\\nso candlelight and fireplaces\\nand campfires are fine,\\ndim lights, very dim lights are fine,\\nand lights low in the\\nphysical environment,\\nof course, the problem with\\ncandlelight and fireplaces\\nis the fire hazard,\\nbut you're smart people, you\\nknow what to do about that.\\nDon't burn down whatever\\nstructure you're in,\\nincluding forests, please.\\nSo, keep the lights low\\nin in your environment.\\nWhat if you wake up in\\nthe middle of the night\\nand you find yourself watching\\nTV or on the computer?\\nWell, in that case, you might\\nwanna wear blue blockers,\\nand you certainly would\\nwanna dim the screen,\\nbut ideally, you're not doing that,\\nit's remarkable the positive effects\\nof getting that bit of\\nsunlight early in the day,\\nmaybe even also around sunset,\\nand avoiding bright lights,\\nand especially overhead bright lights,\\nbetween about 11:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m..\\nNow, I'm not talking about shift work,\\nI'm realizing that we're probably\\ngonna have to have an entire discussion\\ndevoted just to shift workers\\nbecause there's some\\ngood information there\\nabout how they can protect themselves\\nagainst some of the very bad\\nhealth effects of shift work,\\nof getting light in the\\nmiddle of the night,\\nbut we rely on shift workers\\nand they're super important to culture\\nand society and the economy,\\nso I wanna acknowledge them\\nand let you know that\\nwe will do a discussion\\nabout shift work and jet lag,\\nbut let's talk about what light can do\\nin terms of shifting us in healthy ways.\\nSo the way to think\\nabout this whole system,\\nagain, is you've got adenosine building up\\ndepending on how long you've been awake\\nand it's making you sleepy,\\nand then you've got the\\ncircadian mechanisms\\nthat are timing your wakefulness\\nand timing when you wanna be asleep,\\nmainly through cortisol and melatonin,\\nbut there are a bunch of other things\\nthat are downstream of\\ncortisol and melatonin,\\nlike, we tend to be hungrier\\nduring our wakeful period\\nthan late at night,\\nsome people like to eat late at night,\\nbut if you're finding that you\\ncan't become a day person\\nor a morning person,\\nshifting your light exposure, exercise,\\nand food intake to the daytime will help.\\nSome people like to stop\\neating around 6:00 or 8:00 p.m.\\nbecause of metabolic reasons\\nor they're trying to maintain\\ntheir weight or lose weight,\\nthat's actually not supported\\nso well by the literature,\\nthe literature around\\nnutrition essentially says\\nthat it's best to restrict your feeding\\nto a certain period of each 24-hour cycle\\nto not be eating around the clock,\\nand whether or not that's 4\\nhours or 8 hours or 16 hours\\nis a much lengthier discussion\\nthan we have time for now,\\nI would refer you to Satchin Panda's book,\\n\\\"The Circadian Code,\\\"\\nwhich talks all about that,\\nhe's an expert, a former colleague of mine\\nfrom the Salk Institute in San Diego,\\nyou can explore intermittent\\nand circadian fasting,\\nso to speak, through Satchin's literature,\\nwe'll talk about that,\\nwe might even get Satchin\\nin here if we're lucky\\nat some point in the future,\\nbut you can actually use\\nlight to wake up earlier.\\nJamie Zeitzer and colleagues\\ndid a beautiful study\\nshowing that, if you turn on\\nthe lights before waking up,\\nso around 45 minutes to\\nan hour before waking up,\\neven if your eyelids are closed,\\nprovided you're not under the covers,\\nafter doing that for a few days,\\nthat increases your total sleep time\\nand shifts forward the time\\nat which you feel sleepy,\\nit makes you want to go\\nto bed earlier each night.\\nNow, in a kind of diabolical way,\\nthey did this with teenagers\\nwho are notorious for\\nwanting to wake up late\\nand stay up late,\\nand what they found was\\nbright light flashes,\\njust turning on the lights\\nin their environment, overhead lights,\\nbecause they're trying\\nto activate this system\\nand that's why they're\\nusing overhead lights,\\neven through the eyelids,\\nbefore these kids woke up,\\nthen made those kids naturally\\nwanna go to bed earlier\\nand they ended up sleeping longer,\\nso that's something you could try,\\nyou could put your lights on a timer\\nto go on early in the\\nday before you wake up,\\nyou could open your blinds\\nso that sunlight is coming through,\\nand again, if you curl\\nup under the covers,\\nthen it's not gonna reach these neurons,\\nbut it's remarkable that light\\ncan actually penetrate the eyelids,\\nactivate these neurons, and\\ngo to the central clock.\\nThat study illustrates a\\nreally important principle\\nof how you're built,\\nwhich is, you have the capacity\\nfor what are called phase\\nadvances and phase delays,\\nand I don't wanna\\ncomplicate this too much,\\nso the simplest way to think about\\nphase advances and phase delays\\nis that if you see light late in the day,\\nand in particular, in\\nthe middle of the night,\\nyour brain and body, for\\nreasons that now you understand,\\nwill think that that's morning light\\neven though it's not sunlight\\nbecause you have this\\nheightened sensitivity,\\nand it will phase delay,\\nit will delay your clock,\\nit will essentially make\\nyou want to get up later\\nand go to sleep later,\\nso if you get light exposure\\ntoo late in the evening\\nor in the middle of the night,\\nit's going to make it hard\\nto want to wake up that next morning early\\nand to go to bed early.\\nThe opposite is also true,\\nif you wake up early,\\nsay, 6:00 a.m. or 7:00 a.m.,\\nand get light exposure,\\nor even earlier, 4:00 a.m.,\\nand get light exposure,\\nit will phase-advance your clock, okay?\\nIt's gonna make your\\nclock think it's earlier\\nand you'll wanna wake up earlier,\\nso the simple way to think about this\\nis if you're having\\ntrouble waking up early\\nand feeling alert early in the day,\\nyou're going to wanna try\\nand get bright light exposure\\neven before waking up because\\nit will advance your clock,\\nit's sort of like turning\\nthe clock forward,\\nwhereas if you are having\\ntrouble waking up early,\\nyou definitely don't want to get\\ntoo much light exposure\\nor any light exposure\\nto your eyes late in the evening\\nand in the middle of the night\\nbecause it's just gonna delay\\nyour clock more and more,\\nso rather than get into the specifics\\nof everybody's situation\\nbecause there are many of you out there\\nwith different situations\\nand lifestyle requirements, et cetera,\\nthe way to think about this\\nis that you have these internal mechanisms\\nof adenosine and circadian clocks,\\nand they're always operating,\\nand what you're trying to\\ndo is provide them anchors,\\nyou're trying to provide them\\nconsistent, powerful anchors\\nso that your cortisol, your melatonin,\\nand then everything that\\ncascades down from that,\\nlike your metabolism and\\nyour ability to learn\\nand your sense of alertness,\\nyour dopamine, your serotonin,\\nall that stuff is timed regularly,\\none of the reasons why there's\\nso much challenge out there\\nwith focus and anxiety and depression,\\nthere are a lot of reasons for that,\\nbut one of the reasons is that\\npeople's internal mechanisms\\naren't anchored to anything regular.\\nNow, this doesn't require\\nbeing neurotically attached\\nto getting up at a very\\nspecific time, going outside,\\nviewing the sunlight at\\nthe same time every day,\\nthese systems, again, will average,\\nbut if you can provide them\\nconsistent light anchors\\nearly in the day and in the evening,\\nand avoiding light at night,\\nyou will be amazed at\\nthe tremendous number\\nof positive effects\\nthat can come from that\\nat the level of metabolic\\nfactors, hormones,\\nand just general feelings of wellbeing,\\nin fact, most of us are familiar\\nwith what it is to not sleep well\\nand all the terrible effects that has,\\nmaybe one night you're\\nfine, two nights even,\\nfor the new parents out\\nthere, I sympathize with you,\\nbut most people are not\\nfamiliar with what it is\\nto sleep really, really\\nwell on a consistent basis,\\nand when you start doing that\\nby controlling your\\nsleep environment, right,\\nget the proper sleep surface,\\nget the proper pillow,\\nget the temperature in the room right,\\nget your light exposure right,\\nstart timing your exercise\\nat normal periods or times\\nthroughout the day and week,\\nit's amazing how many\\nother biological systems\\njust naturally fall in line,\\nand this is why whenever people ask me,\\n\\\"What should I take?\\\"\\nwhich is one of the most\\ncommon questions I get,\\n\\\"What supplement should I take?\\n\\\"What drug should I be taking?\\n\\\"What things should I be taking?\\\"\\nThe first question I always ask\\nthem is, \\\"How's your sleep?\\\"\\nand 90% of the time, they tell me\\nthey either have trouble\\nfalling asleep or staying asleep\\nor they don't feel rested\\nthroughout the day.\\nA brief note about naps,\\nnaps, provided that they're\\nless than one ultradian cycle,\\nprovided they're 20 minutes\\nor 30 minutes or even an hour,\\ncan be very beneficial\\nfor a lot of people,\\nyou don't have to take them,\\nbut many people naturally feel a dip\\nin energy and focus late in the afternoon,\\nin fact, if we were gonna\\nlook at wakefulness,\\nwhat we would find is that you get\\nthat morning light exposure, hopefully,\\nyour cortisol goes up, people\\nwill start feeling awake,\\nand then around two, or three,\\nor four in the afternoon,\\nthere's a spike in everything\\nfrom alertness to ability to learn,\\nsome metabolic factors drop,\\nand then it just naturally comes back up,\\nand then it tapers off\\nas the night goes on.\\nSo for some of you, naps are great,\\nI love taking naps,\\nsome people, they wake up from\\nnaps feeling really groggy,\\nthat's probably because\\nthey're not sleeping\\nas well as they should at night\\nor as long as they should at night,\\nand so they're dropping into REM sleep\\nor deeper forms of sleep in the day time,\\nand then they wake up and\\nthey feel kind of disoriented,\\nother people feel great after a nap,\\nso that's another case where,\\njust like with caffeine,\\nso sort of have to evaluate for yourself.\\nAs we discuss this,\\nyou're probably realizing\\nthis is a lot like nutrition\\nwhere nowadays it's just crazy,\\nI mean, if you go on social media,\\nit's like you've got people\\nwho are pushing carnivore,\\nyou've got other people\\nwho are pushing vegan,\\nother people who are pushing paleo,\\nevery variation of every diet,\\nand there's a lot of data to support\\nany and all of those and\\nthe arguments go on and on,\\nand there's probably a\\nlot of genetic variation\\nand lifestyle variation\\nthat's going to dictate whether or not\\nsomething is good for you,\\nwhether or not you like it,\\nwhether or not you'll stick to it.\\nThe same thing is true for circadian\\nand sleep and wakefulness behaviors,\\nexcept the light-viewing behavior\\nthat I talked about before,\\nthere's no way around that,\\nthat's hardwired into our system,\\nthe same way we could factually say\\nthat everybody needs some nutrition\\nat some level from some source,\\neverybody needs light information\\narriving in their system in\\nsome way at regular intervals,\\nso that's really what this is about.\\nOkay, so naps are gonna\\nbe good for some people,\\nnot for others,\\nI have a colleague, a very\\naccomplished neuroscientist,\\nwho likes to take naps just after lunch,\\nI personally like to take a\\nnap around 3:00 or 4:00 p.m.,\\nbut there's a practice\\nthat I've adopted in the last 5 years\\nthat I've found to be immensely beneficial\\nthat is sort of like\\nnapping but isn't napping,\\nit's a thing that they call yoga nidra,\\nyoga nidra actually means yoga sleep,\\nand it's a sort of meditation\\nthat you listen to,\\nthere are number of scripts,\\nI've talked about this on podcasts before\\nbut I'm going to post a link\\nto the two that I like most,\\nthat allows you to consciously\\nbring your entire body and mind\\ninto a state of deep relaxation,\\nand sometimes you fall asleep\\nand sometimes you don't,\\nthis is done for 10 to 30 or\\neven 60 minutes at a time.\\nThe other thing that works\\nreally well is meditation,\\nso I'm talking about naps,\\nbut I'm also talking about yoga nidra,\\nwhich is sort of a form of meditation,\\nand then more standard\\nforms of meditation,\\nall three of those do something powerful\\nwhich is that they bring our mind\\ninto a state of less so-called\\nsympathetic nervous system activation,\\ngo back and listen to episode one\\nif that doesn't make any sense,\\nwhich is what governs your alertness,\\nand instead, it activates\\ncells and circuits in your body\\nthat promote the\\nparasympathetic nervous system,\\nor the calming system.\\nA lot of people are\\nnot good falling asleep\\nbecause they're not good at calming down,\\nso some people have no\\ntrouble falling asleep,\\nbut many people have a\\nhard time falling asleep,\\nor at least every once in a while\\nexperience challenges falling asleep.\\nI don't have problems\\nfalling asleep most nights,\\nbut I've noticed that\\nif I'm working very hard\\nor if the world is particularly stressful,\\nmy mind gets into a bit\\nof a kind of OCD loop\\nwhere I tend to ruminate on things,\\nand I'm not even thinking\\nabout anything in particular,\\nit's just challenging for me\\nto disengage and fall asleep.\\nMeditation and yoga nidra scripts\\nhave been immensely helpful for me\\nin terms of accelerating\\nthe transition to sleep,\\nso they involve taking a few minutes,\\n10 to 30 minutes or so,\\njust like you would for a nap,\\nand just listening to a\\nscript, almost passively,\\nand it has you do some\\nparticular patterns of breathing\\nand some other kind of\\nbody-scan-like things\\nthat can really help\\npeople learn to relax,\\nnot just in that moment,\\nbut get better at relaxing\\nand turning off thinking\\nin order to fall asleep when\\nthey wanna do that at night.\\nThere's another thing\\nthat's similar to this,\\nwhich is certain forms\\nof hypnosis for sleep,\\nfor that, I'll just\\nrefer you to the website\\nof a colleague and collaborator of mine,\\nDavid Spiegel, who's our associate chair\\nof Psychiatry and Behavioral\\nSciences at Stanford,\\nhe's developed a website,\\nwhich is reverie,\\nR-E-V-E-R-I-E, health.com,\\nso reveriehealth.com,\\nthat has a lot of science-supported,\\nclinically supported hypnosis scripts\\nthat essentially take the brain\\ninto states of deep relaxation\\nfor the sake of rewiring the\\nbrain and neuroplasticity,\\nbut one of those scripts that's there\\nand is available free is for sleep,\\nand we'll talk more about\\nhypnosis at a later time\\nbecause it has a ton of other effects\\nthat aren't just limited to sleep.\\nSo a period of time each day\\nthat you devote to getting better\\nat falling and staying asleep\\nis actually a really\\ngood practice to adopt.\\nThe other thing about these practices\\nlike meditation, yoga nidra, and hypnosis,\\nis people would always say to me,\\n\\\"Well, when should I do them?\\\"\\nand I always say, \\\"Well, the\\nbest time of day to do it\\n\\\"is when you first wake up in the morning,\\n\\\"provided you've gotten\\nyour sunlight already,\\n\\\"anytime you wake up in\\nthe middle of the night,\\n\\\"or any time of day.\\\"\\nIn other words, they're\\nalways good for you\\nbecause it's a training mechanism\\nby which you self-train\\nyour nervous system\\nto go from a state of heightened alertness\\nthat you don't want\\nto heightened relaxation that you do want,\\nand so it's really teaching\\nyou to hit the brake,\\nand that brings us to an even\\nmore important point, perhaps,\\nwhich is, we've all experienced\\nthat we can stay up if we want to, right?\\nIf we wanna stay up late on New Year's\\nor we wanna push an all-nighter,\\nsome people can do that\\nmore easily than others,\\nbut we're all capable of doing that,\\nbut it's very hard to make\\nourselves fall asleep,\\nand so there's a sort of asymmetry\\nto the way our autonomic nervous system,\\nwhich governs this\\nalertness-calmness thing,\\nthe sympathetic and\\nparasympathetic nervous system,\\nthere's an asymmetry there\\nwhere we are more easily\\nable to engage wakefulness\\nand drive wakefulness,\\nwe can force ourselves to stay awake,\\nthan we are able to force\\nourselves to fall asleep,\\nand one of the things that\\nI say over and over again,\\nand I'm gonna continue to\\nsay over and over again,\\nis it's very hard to control\\nthe mind with the mind,\\nwhen you have trouble falling asleep,\\nyou need to look to some\\nmechanism that involves the body,\\nand all the things I described,\\nmeditation, hypnosis, yoga nidra,\\nall involve exhale-emphasized breathing,\\ncertain ways of lying down\\nand controlling the body,\\nwe're gonna get into\\nbreathing in real depth\\nat another time,\\nbut all of those involve using\\nthe body to control the mind\\nrather than trying to, you know,\\nwrestle your mind into a\\ncertain pattern of relaxation,\\nso earlier in episode one, I\\ntalked about the Mobius strip,\\nthis continuous loop that is\\nthe brain-body relationship,\\nor the mind-body relationship,\\nand when we're having\\ntrouble controlling the mind,\\nI encourage people to\\nlook towards the body,\\nlook toward sunlight,\\navoid sunlight and bright light\\nif that happens to be late at night,\\nso there's a theme\\nthat's starting to emerge\\nwhich is, in order to control this thing\\nthat we call the nervous system,\\nwe have to look back to\\nsome of the things we discussed earlier,\\nlike sensation, perception, et cetera,\\nbut we have to ask, what can we control?\\nWell, I'm talking about\\ncontrolling light exposure,\\ncontrolling your breathing and body,\\nI'm not going into details right now\\nbut you can see the yoga nidra script\\nor the reveriehealth.com,\\nor Headspace would be a great place\\nto adopt a meditation practice,\\nany of those are really teaching you\\nto use your body to control your mind,\\nand to allow you to explore\\nthe mind-body relationship\\nin a way that gives you more control\\nover your mind and the\\nmind-body relationship, okay?\\nSo we talked about light,\\nwe talked about activity\\nand timing of light,\\nwe talked about the usefulness of naps,\\nand these things that I'm\\ncalling non-sleep deep rest,\\nwhich include meditation,\\nyoga nidra, and hypnosis,\\nnon-sleep deep rest,\\nor what I, hereafter, we\\nwill refer to as NSDR,\\nnot to be confused with EMDR,\\nI don't think I've ever heard NSDR,\\nso I'm planting a flag for\\nNSDR, non-sleep deep rest,\\nas a way to reset one's\\nability to be awake\\nafter you emerge from NSDR,\\nso to get some more wakefulness\\nand ability to attend,\\nsome emotional stability, reset,\\nas well as make it better\\nand easier to fall asleep\\nwhen you wanna go to sleep at night.\\nNow, the non-sleep deep rest\\ndoes have some research to support it,\\nthere's a beautiful study done\\nout of a university in Denmark,\\nI will later provide a link to that study,\\nthat showed that this meditation\\nand yoga nidra-type meditation\\nallows dopamine and other neuromodulators\\nin an area of the brain\\ncalled the striatum\\nthat's involved in motor\\nplanning and motor execution,\\nto reset itself,\\nin other words, this NSDR\\ncan reset our ability\\nto engage in the world in a\\nway that's very deliberate,\\nand not to throw in another acronym,\\nbut NSDR resets your\\nability to engage in DPOs,\\nduration, path, and outcome,\\nso now you're probably\\nrolling your eyes like,\\n\\\"Oh my goodness, the number of acronyms,\\\"\\nbut just bear with me\\nbecause NSDR is so powerful,\\nbecause first of all, it doesn't require\\nthat you rig yourself to any device,\\nit doesn't require that you\\ntake much time out of your day,\\nit doesn't require that you\\ningest anything, except air,\\nand it can have so many positive effects\\nright down to the neuromodulator level,\\nso I think in the years to come,\\nmy lab's exploring this\\nin a collaboration with\\nDavid Spiegel's lab,\\nbut other labs are\\nlooking at this as well,\\nI think NSDR is going to start\\nto play a more prominent role\\nin what we call wellness and health,\\nboth mental health and physical health,\\nso I encourage you to\\nexplore those practices.\\nOkay, so what about things that we can\\nand maybe should or should not take\\nin order to control\\nand access better sleep\\nand better wakefulness?\\nWe've talked about things\\nyou can do or not do,\\nwe've talked about nutrition\\nand the timing of nutrition,\\nnow let's talk about compounds,\\nthose could be prescription drugs,\\nthose could be supplements,\\nthere are a number of different things\\nthat will affect your\\ncircadian timing and behavior,\\nin fact, almost everything\\nthat you could take\\nwill affect your circadian\\ntiming and behavior,\\nthat's right.\\nSo years ago when I\\nwas in graduate school,\\nI had a professor, unfortunately,\\nhe passed away now,\\nbut his name was Ted Jones,\\nthe late Edward Jones,\\nwho was a world-class neuroanatomist,\\nhe wrote the book on the thalamus,\\nin fact, it's called \\\"The Thalamus,\\\"\\nand an expert on patterns\\nof activation in the brain\\nduring sleep,\\nand I'll never forget that\\nduring one of these lectures,\\nsomeone asked Ted the question,\\n\\\"What is the effect of some drug\\n\\\"on these waves of activity in\\nthe thalamus?\\\" or something,\\nand his answer was incredible.\\nNow, he was a pretty gruff guy,\\nand so his answer was delivered\\nin the form of a kind of\\naggressive direct statement,\\nhe said, \\\"A drug is a substance\\n\\\"that when injected into a person,\\n\\\"produces a scientific publication,\\\"\\nand what he was saying\\nis actually quite true,\\nwhich is that most every compound\\nwill have some effect on\\nsome aspect of biology,\\nthis is why it's hard\\nto sort through everything\\nthat's on PubMed,\\nif you put any molecule or\\ncompound or drug into PubMed\\nand then you put sleep next to\\nit, or alertness next to it,\\nyou're likely to find a paper\\nwhere there's an effect,\\nbut that's not necessarily telling you\\nthat that drug is helpful for that,\\nwhat it's telling you is\\nthat anytime you change what you take\\nor you stop taking something,\\nsay you're taking sleeping\\npills, Ambien or whatever it is,\\nand you stop taking them,\\nyour sleep behavior will change.\\nLet's stay you take an aspirin\\nand you don't normally take aspirin,\\nyou will shift your circadian rhythm,\\nnow you might not shift it perceptibly,\\nyou might not create\\nproblems for yourself,\\nbut anytime you ingest a\\ncompound at high potency,\\nyou're going to provide some\\nshift to your circadian rhythm.\\nNow, that said, there are a couple things\\nthat are directly in line with the biology\\nrelated to falling and staying asleep\\nand directly in line with\\nthe biology of wakefulness,\\nthere's a whole category of things,\\nlike stimulants, cocaine, amphetamine,\\nand prescription stimulants, that are,\\nthe prescription ones were designed\\nfor the treatment of narcolepsy,\\nso things like modafinil or armodafinil\\nthat are designed to created wakefulness,\\nthey are all essentially chemical variants\\nof things that increase\\nepinephrine and dopamine.\\nNow, of course, I'm of the standpoint\\nthat things like cocaine and amphetamine\\nare just across the board bad,\\nthey have so many addictive\\nand terrible effects,\\nin the proper setting prescribed\\nby the proper professional,\\nthings like modafinil for\\nnarcolepsy might be appropriate,\\nI know that a lot of people\\nout there take Adderall,\\neven though they haven't\\nbeen prescribed Adderall,\\nin order to increase wakefulness,\\nthat is essentially, well,\\nit's illegal for one,\\nbut also it's abusing the system\\nin the sense that you're pushing back\\non the adenosine system\\nslightly differently\\nthan you do caffeine,\\nit will make you feel more alert,\\nthere tends to be a heavy rebound\\nand they do have an addictive potential,\\nthere are also some other effects of those\\nthat could be quite bad,\\nso we're gonna explore stimulants\\nin a whole month related to drugs,\\nbut there are some supplements\\nand some things that are\\nsafer, certainly safer,\\nand that, in cases where you're\\ndoing all the right behaviors,\\nyou're exercising and eating correctly\\nand you're still having\\ntrouble with sleep,\\nthat can be beneficial for\\nfalling and staying asleep.\\nNow, I wanna be very clear,\\nI am not pushing supplements,\\nI am just pointing you toward some things\\nthat have been shown in\\npeer-reviewed studies\\nto have some benefit.\\nThe first one is magnesium,\\nthere are many forms of magnesium,\\nbut certain forms of magnesium\\ncan have positive effects on sleepiness\\nand the ability to stay asleep,\\nmainly by way of increasing\\nneurotransmitters like GABA\\nwhich help turn off the DPO,\\nthe kind of thinking about the future,\\nduration-path-outcome analysis,\\nand make one's mind kind\\nof drift in space and time\\nand make it easier to fall asleep,\\nthere are a lot of forms\\nof magnesium out there,\\nbut in particular is magnesium\\nthreonate, T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E,\\nwhich you have to check to\\nsee if this is right for you,\\ncheck with your doctor,\\nbut magnesium threonate is\\nassociated with transporters in the body\\nthat bring more of it into cells\\nthat allow people to feel\\nthis kind of drowsiness\\nand help them fall asleep,\\nso I personally, I can only\\ntalk about what I personally do,\\nI personally take 3 or 400\\nmilligrams of magnesium threonate\\nabout 30 to 60 minutes before sleep,\\nand it helps me fall asleep.\\nThe other thing is theanine, T-H-E-A,\\nT-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine,\\n100 to 200 milligrams of theanine, for me,\\nalso helps me turn off\\nmy mind and fall asleep,\\nI take it 30 to 60 minutes\\nthroughout the day.\\nInterestingly, theanine\\nis now being introduced\\nto a lot of energy drinks\\nin order to take away the jitters\\nthat are associated with\\ndrinking too much caffeine\\nor with some other things\\nthat are in the energy drinks,\\nenergy drinks can be problematic,\\nthey can contain a lot of L-taurine,\\nI'll just tell you an anecdote,\\nwhen I was a postdoc,\\nI was drinking a lot of a\\nparticular energy drink,\\nit has a lot of taurine in it,\\nand actually the whites of my eyes,\\nthe sclera, as it's called,\\nof my eyes turned beet red,\\nand I went to a friend\\nwho's an ophthalmologist,\\nI said, \\\"Look, I'm not a marijuana smoker,\\n\\\"I haven't been hit on the head,\\n\\\"I don't know what's going on,\\\"\\nand he looked and he said,\\n\\\"I think you've got some\\nmicrovascular damage,\\\"\\nand we walked through what\\nI was taking and doing,\\nand he said, \\\"Oh, it's\\nprobably the taurine,\\n\\\"excessive levels of taurine\\n\\\"can create some microvascular damage.\\\"\\nSo if you're having\\nmicrovascular damage in your eye,\\nyou probably have microvascular damage\\ndeeper in your skull, so I stopped,\\nthat's the reason why I\\ndon't take energy drinks,\\nso just a consideration,\\nagain, I'm not here to tell\\nyou what to do or not do,\\nbut just wanna arm you with information.\\nThe thing about theanine and magnesium\\nis taken together, they\\ndo, for some people,\\nthey can make them so\\nsleepy and sleep so deeply\\nthat they actually have trouble\\nwaking up in the morning,\\nso you have to play with\\nthese things and titrate them\\nif you decide to use them,\\nagain, if you decide to go this route,\\nI would not start by taking supplements,\\nI would start by getting your\\nlight-viewing behavior correct,\\nand then think about your nutrition\\nand then think about your activity\\nand then think about whether\\nor not you wanna supplement,\\nwe already talked about melatonin earlier.\\nThere's another supplement\\nthat could be quite useful,\\nwhich is apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N,\\nwhich is a derivative of chamomile,\\n50 milligrams of apigenin\\nalso can augment or support\\nthis kind of creation of a sleepiness\\nto help fall asleep and stay asleep.\\nA note about sleepwalkers and\\npeople with very vivid dreams,\\ntheanine can often make\\nyour dreams very vivid,\\nsleepwalkers should be\\ncareful about taking theanine,\\neveryone should be careful\\nabout taking anything,\\nand don't take anything\\nwithout consulting your\\nboard-certified M.D.\\nor healthcare professional first, okay?\\nYour health is your responsibility,\\nI am not gonna take responsibility\\nfor what you decide to do\\nexperimentally in any case,\\nbut especially as it relates\\nto supplementation and drugs.\\nAs a important point, apigenin\\nis a fairly potent estrogen inhibitor,\\nso women who want to keep\\ntheir estrogen levels high,\\nor at whatever levels\\nthey happen to be at,\\nshould probably avoid apigenin altogether,\\nand men, take that into\\nconsideration as well,\\nmen need estrogen also,\\nyou don't wanna completely\\neliminate your estrogen,\\nthat it can create all\\nsorts of bad effects\\non libido and cognition, et cetera,\\nso apigenin in some people\\nis gonna be a pretty\\nstrong estrogen inhibitor,\\nso keep that in mind.\\nThere are other things you can take\\nto help you sleep better,\\nthose are the legal ones\\nthat, at least I'm aware of,\\nhave pretty broad safety margins,\\nbut again, you need to explore\\nyour safety margins with any compound.\\nI think a great website\\nthat I can refer you to is examine.com,\\nexamine, the word, just as it\\nsounds, .com, is a website,\\nI have no relation to them,\\nbut there, you can find links\\nto peer-reviewed studies\\nfor any compound or supplement,\\nas well as some important warnings\\nrelated to the things I discussed,\\nas well as any other thing\\nthat you might decide to supplement with\\nor ingest to help improve your sleep.\\nOkay, that was a lot of information\\nabout how to get better at sleeping,\\nfalling asleep, wakefulness, et cetera.\\nAn important feature of\\nthis podcast, as you know,\\nis that we dive deep into topics\\nfor several episodes at a time,\\nat least a month at a time,\\nso by stopping here, I recognize\\nthat there are probably\\nmany

science.\\n(energetic music)\",\n          \"- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\\nwhere we discuss science\\nand science based tools\\nfor everyday life.\\n[cheerful music]\\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\\nand I'm a professor of\\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\\nToday, we are discussing aggression.\\nI'm going to explain to you that there are\\nseveral different types of\\naggression, for instance,\\nreactive aggression versus\\nproactive aggression.\\nMeaning sometimes people\\nwill be aggressive\\nbecause they feel threatened\\nor they are protecting\\nthose that they love,\\nwho also feel threatened.\\nThere's also proactive\\naggression where people\\ngo out of their way to\\ndeliberately try and harm others.\\nAnd there is indirect\\naggression, which is aggression,\\nnot involving physical\\nviolence, for instance,\\nshaming people and things of that sort.\\nIt turns out that there are\\ndifferent biological mechanisms\\nunderlying each of the\\ndifferent types of aggression.\\nAnd today I will define those for you.\\nI'll talk about the neural\\ncircuits in the brain and body\\nthat mediate each of the\\ndifferent kinds of aggression.\\nTalk about some of the\\nhormones and peptides\\nand neurotransmitters involved.\\nI promise to make it\\nall accessible to you,\\neven if you do not have any\\nbiology or science background,\\nI will also discuss\\ntools, psychological tools\\nand biological tools that one can use to\\nbetter control aggression.\\nNow, right here at the outset,\\nI want to acknowledge that any\\ndiscussion about aggression\\nhas to have an element\\nof context within it.\\nTo be fair, human beings\\ninvest a lot of money,\\na lot of time, and a lot of energy,\\nand indeed can even derive\\npleasure from aggression.\\nLater I'll talk about neural\\ncircuits in the brain and body\\nthat reinforce, in other words,\\nreward through the release\\nof chemicals that make people feel good.\\nActs of aggression.\\nHowever, what I'm mainly referring to\\nis the context in which\\nhuman beings will pay money\\nin order to derive what we\\ncall vicarious aggression,\\nput it simply people spend\\nan enormous amount of money\\nand time and energy watching\\nother people engage in,\\nfor instance, aggressive sports.\\nAnd we know that observing\\nyour team winning\\nover another team causes the\\nrelease of neurochemicals\\nin your brain and body\\nthat make you feel good.\\nAnd yes, that can make\\nyou feel more aggressive.\\nWe also know of course that\\nmost governments invest\\nmany billions if not trillions of dollars\\nin infrastructure,\\ntechnologies and human beings\\nin order to engage in\\naggression if needed,\\nso-called military warfare, et cetera.\\nSo today's discussion will\\ninclude a description of\\naggression in the pathological sense.\\nWe'll actually talk about an\\nexplosive aggressive disorder\\nthat most of you probably\\nhaven't heard of,\\nbut is actually far more\\ncommon than perhaps, you know,\\nwe'll talk about the role of\\nthings like attention deficit,\\nhyperactivity disorder,\\nand how that can relate\\nto aggression through\\nthe relationship between\\nimpulsivity and aggression.\\nAnd we'll talk about verbal aggression,\\nphysical aggression, proactive aggression,\\nas mentioned before,\\nand reactive aggression.\\nI'm certain that by\\nthe end of the episode,\\nyou will come away with a much\\nmore thorough understanding\\nof what this thing that we\\ncall aggression really is.\\nAnd when you see it in other people,\\nI think it will make more sense to you.\\nAnd when you observe it in\\nyourself or the impulse to engage\\nin aggression, verbal,\\nor physical or otherwise,\\nI hope that you'll\\nunderstand it better as well.\\nAnd of course, the tools\\nthat I will describe\\nshould allow you to modulate and control\\naggressive tendencies or\\npredispositions to aggressiveness\\nand just generally to be\\nable to engage with people\\nin a more adaptive way overall.\\nBefore we begin, I'd like to\\nemphasize that this podcast\\nis separate from my teaching\\nand research roles at Stanford.\\nIt is however, part of\\nmy desire and effort\\nto bring zero cost to consumer\\ninformation about science\\nand science related tools\\nto the general public.\\nIn keeping with that theme,\\nI'd like to thank the\\nsponsors of today's podcast.\\nOur first sponsor is Athletic Greens.\\nAthletic Greens is an\\nall-in-one vitamin mineral\\nprobiotic drink that's designed to meet\\nall your foundational health needs.\\nI started taking Athletic\\nGreens way back in 2012.\\nSo I'm delighted that they're\\nsponsoring this podcast.\\nThe reason I started\\ntaking Athletic Greens\\nand the reason I still\\ntake Athletic Greens\\nonce or twice a day is that\\nit covers all of my basic\\nvitamin mineral and probiotic needs.\\nThe probiotics are\\nespecially important to me.\\nThere are now abundant data\\nshowing that the gut microbiome,\\nwhich is basically a\\ncommunity of trillions\\nof little bacteria that live\\nin our guts are beneficial\\nfor our immune system, for brain function,\\nfor mood and many other\\naspects of our health.\\nThe gut microbiome thrives on\\nprobiotics and Athletic Greens\\ncontains the proper array of probiotics\\nto optimize the gut microbiome.\\nAthletic Greens also has\\nadaptogens for recovery\\nfrom physical and mental exertion,\\ndigestive enzymes for gut\\nhealth, vitamin C, zinc,\\nas I mentioned before, all the\\nother vitamins and minerals\\nthat you need in order to cover\\nyour basic needs each day.\\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\\nand claim a special offer.\\nThat'll give you five free\\ntravel packs that make it easy\\nto mix up Athletic Greens\\nwhile you're on the road\\nand a year supply of Vitamin D3K2.\\nThere's now a wealth of\\ndata showing that vitamin D3\\nis important for many\\naspects of our immediate\\nand long term health.\\nMany people, even if they\\nget out in the sunlight\\nare not getting enough Vitamin D3,\\nand the K2 is thought to be beneficial\\nfor calcium regulation and\\na number of other things\\nimportant to our health.\\nSo again, if you go to\\nathleticGreens.com/huberman,\\nyou can claim the\\nspecial offer of the five\\nfree travel packs and the\\nyear's supply of vitamin D3K2.\\nToday's episode is also\\nbrought to us by ROKA.\\nROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses\\nthat are the absolute highest quality.\\nThe company was founded by\\ntwo All-American swimmers\\nfrom Stanford and everything\\nabout their eyeglasses\\nand sunglasses were designed\\nwith performance in mind,\\nI've spent a lifetime\\nworking on the biology\\nof the visual system, I can\\ntell you that your visual system\\nhas to contend with some\\npretty tough challenges\\nas you move throughout the day.\\nFor instance, if you go\\nfrom a brightly lit region\\nto a dimmer region, your\\nvisual system has to adjust.\\nROKA eyeglasses and\\nsunglasses were designed\\nwith those sorts of adjustments in mind.\\nSo for instance, if you're\\noutside in the shade,\\nyou move into the sun and\\nthen back into the shade,\\nyou don't have to take\\nyour sunglasses on and off.\\nTheir glasses were initially designed\\nfor sports performance\\nand the great thing is\\nthey could be used for\\nthat, but also they have\\na terrific aesthetic, so you can wear them\\nto work or out to dinner.\\nI wear readers at night\\nand when I drive at night\\nand I wear sunglasses, if I'm out a lot\\non really bright days.\\nThe terrific thing about\\nROKA glasses is that even\\nif you get sweaty, they won't fall off.\\nSo you can run with them,\\nyou can cycle with them.\\nOr as I mentioned before, you can just\\nwear them out and about.\\nIf you'd like to try ROKA,\\nyou can go to roka.com,\\nthat's R-O-K-A.com and\\nenter the code \\\"Huberman\\\"\\nto save 20% off your first order.\\nAgain, that's ROKA roka.com\\nand enter the code \\\"Huberman\\\" at checkout.\\nToday's episode is also\\nbrought to us by Helix Sleep.\\nHelix Sleep makes mattresses\\nand pillows that in my opinion\\nare the very best you'll find.\\nI started sleeping on a Helix mattress\\na little over a year ago,\\nand it's the best sleep\\nI've had ever since.\\nIf you go to the Helix site,\\nthey have a terrific sleep quiz\\nthat just takes a few minutes,\\nask you questions like,\\n\\\"Do you tend to sleep on your side,\\nyour back or your stomach?\\\"\\nMaybe you don't know\\nbecause you're asleep,\\nbut many people do know.\\nAnd even if you don't know that's okay,\\nit will also ask you questions like,\\n\\\"Do you tend to run hot or cold?\\\"\\nDo you tend to wake up in the\\nmiddle of the night or not?\\nAnd by taking that brief\\nquiz, they will match you\\nto the specific mattress\\nthat's ideal for you\\nand your sleep needs.\\nAnd that's really what sets\\nHelix Sleep mattresses apart.\\nEverybody's unique, and they know that.\\nSo if you take this\\nquiz, you'll get matched\\nto a particular mattress.\\nFor me, it was the\\n\\\"Dusk\\\" mattress D-U-S-K,\\nbut again, that's just me,\\nand you may match to that one,\\nor you may match to a different one.\\nIf you're interested in\\nupgrading your mattress\\nand sleeping much better, go\\nto helixsleep.com/huberman.\\nTake that two minute sleep\\nquiz and they'll match you\\nto a customized mattress and\\nyou'll get up to $200 off\\nany mattress order and two free pillows.\\nI also love their pillows.\\nI've always had this issue with pillows\\nthat they heat up too much.\\nI'm always looking for the\\npillow that can cool itself.\\nSomehow the pillows stay nice and cool.\\nThey're also not too big,\\nso I'm not propped up,\\nnot getting the Text Neck\\nin the middle of the night,\\nwhere I'm letting my chin push my chest,\\nnor am I falling back and\\nhaving trouble breathing\\nin the middle of the night.\\nThey're designed just right.\\nThey also have a 10 years warranty\\nand you get to try it out for\\na hundred nights, risk free.\\nThey'll even pick it up for\\nyou if you don't love it.\\nBut I think that you will.\\nAgain, if you're interested, you can go\\nto helixsleep.com/huberman\\nfor up to $200 off\\nand two free pillows.\\nLet's talk about aggression.\\nI think that many people\\nout there are put off\\nby aggression, although\\nothers are drawn to aggression\\nboth in themselves and when\\nobserving it in others.\\nThe reason to talk about aggression is,\\nthat as mentioned before,\\nthe context of aggression really matters.\\nSo there are instances where\\naggression is adaptive.\\nFor instance, a mother\\nprotecting her children\\nif she's being attacked,\\nor if her children are being threatened.\\nI think most people would\\nagree that so-called\\nmaternal aggression of that sort,\\nprovided the context is\\nright, is a great thing.\\nProtecting our young is\\nafter all one of the primary\\nadaptive drives of our species,\\nand thank goodness it is.\\nOf course, other forms of aggression\\nlike unprovoked, proactive aggression,\\nsomebody simply being\\nviolent to somebody else,\\neven when unprovoked, most of us cringe\\nwhen we see that kind of behavior,\\nit can even evoke aggression in people\\nwhen they observe that kind of behavior.\\nSo again, context really matters,\\nbut a more general and perhaps\\nan even more important reason\\nto think about and understand aggression\\nis that by understanding the biology\\nand psychology of aggression, you will be\\nin a much better position to understand\\nhow all emotional states come to be,\\nboth in yourself and in others.\\nFor instance, many of you have\\nprobably heard the statement\\nthat I believe arises from pop psychology,\\nnot from formal academic psychology,\\nthat aggression is just sadness.\\nIt's a form of sadness that's amplified\\nand it shows up as aggression.\\nBut when we look at the underlying biology\\nand the peer reviewed literature on this,\\nnothing could be further from the truth.\\nWe have distinct circuits\\nin the brain for aggression\\nversus grief and mourning,\\nthose are non-overlapping.\\nNow that doesn't mean that you\\ncan't be sad and aggressive\\nor in a state of mourning and\\naggressive at the same time,\\nbut the idea that sadness and aggression\\nare one in the same\\nthing is simply not true.\\nAnd by understanding that,\\nor perhaps by understanding\\nthat irritability and aggression\\nare not the same thing,\\nyou'll be in a much\\nbetter position to apply\\nsome of the tools that we will\\ntalk about in this episode\\nin order to be able to\\nreduce or eliminate,\\nor if it's adaptive to you\\nto modulate aggression.\\nAnd yes, there are cases where\\nmodulating your aggression\\nin some cases, even amplifying\\naggression can be adaptive.\\nNow this of course is\\nnot the first discussion\\nabout the biology of aggression\\nor the psychology of aggression.\\nAnd we really can look to the\\nbeginning of the last century\\nas the time in which the formal study\\nof aggression really began.\\nOne of the names that's most\\nassociated with the formal\\nstudy of aggression is none\\nother than Konrad Lorenz.\\nSome of you may be\\nfamiliar with that name,\\nothers of you may not be\\nfamiliar with that name.\\nKonrad Lorenz studied\\nso-called imprinting behaviors\\nand fixed action pattern behaviors.\\nHe's most famous, at least\\nin scientific circles,\\nfor getting geese to believe\\nthat he was their parent.\\nAnd if you were to put into\\nGoogle Conrad with a K, Lorenz,\\njust as it sounds, Konrad Lorenz, geese,\\nyou're going to see a\\nlot of photos of Conrad\\nwalking down roads with a\\nlot of geese following him\\nor swimming in lakes with a\\nlot of geese following him.\\nHe had a habit of geese adopting him\\nbecause of the behaviors\\nthat he partook in.\\nSo he would swim out on a lake\\nin front of a bunch of\\nlittle geese and then\\nthey would think that he was the parent\\nand they would imprint on him.\\nHe even lived with these\\nanimals and they lived with him,\\nsort of a strange\\ncharacter from what I hear.\\nBut nonetheless, all\\nthis work was deserving\\nof a Nobel prize because\\nwhat he discovered\\nwere fixed action patterns.\\nThat is patterns of behavior\\nthat could be evoked by a single stimulus.\\nOkay. This is really important.\\nThe idea that you can get a\\nwhole category of behaviors,\\nlike swimming behind a parent,\\nor looking to somebody for\\ncomfort, and only them,\\nthe idea that you could\\nget a huge category\\nof different behaviors in a\\nbunch of different contexts\\ntriggered by just the presence\\nof that person is remarkable,\\nbecause what it suggested\\nand what turns out to be true\\nis that there are neural circuits,\\nnot just individual brain\\nareas, but collections\\nof brain areas that work together\\nto engage a pattern of behaviors.\\nAnd that's the first fundamental principle\\nthat we need to define today,\\nthat when we talk about aggression,\\nwe are talking about\\nactivation of neural circuits,\\nnot individual brain\\nareas, but neural circuits\\nthat get played out in\\nsequence like keys on a piano,\\nbut that playing out in sequence means\\nthat aggression is a verb.\\nIt has a beginning, a middle\\nand an end, and it's a process.\\nIt's not an event.\\nAnd as you'll see, that turns\\nout to be very important\\nin terms of thinking about\\nhow one can halt aggression,\\nprevent it from happening\\nbefore it's initiated,\\nor maybe even prolonging aggression,\\nif that's what's needed.\\nNow, Konrad Lorenz had no real\\nknowledge of neural circuits.\\nI mean, obviously he\\nknew there was this thing\\nthat we call a brain and a nervous system,\\nand he knew that there\\nwere chemicals in the brain\\nand hormones and things of that sort\\nthat were likely to play a role,\\nbut he really didn't take\\nany measures to define\\nwhat the neural circuits were,\\nfrankly, he didn't need to.\\nHe had his Nobel prize and he\\ndid all this beautiful work.\\nHe's known for an abundance of work,\\nbut he did think about what\\nsorts of underlying processes\\ncould drive something like aggression.\\nAnd he talked about one particular feature\\nthat's especially important,\\nand that's this notion of a pressure.\\nThe idea that yes, certain\\nhormones will bias somebody\\nor an animal to be aggressive,\\ncertain neural transmitter\\nstates, and you'll learn\\nwhat those are today will bias somebody\\nto be more or less aggressive,\\nmaybe even submissive and passive,\\nmaybe outright proactively\\naggressive towards anyone\\nor anything in front of them.\\nAnd yes, of course there\\nwill be historical features\\nbased on their childhood,\\net cetera, et cetera.\\nHe understood that there will\\nbe a constellation of things\\nthat would drive people to be aggressive.\\nAnd he described a so-called pressure,\\nalmost like a hydraulic pressure.\\nJust think about fluid\\npressure in a small container\\nbeing pushed, pushed,\\npushed until the can,\\nor the container is ready to explode\\nand how multiple features,\\nmultiple variables\\ncould impinge on that\\nand create that pressure.\\nIt turns out that's exactly\\nthe way the system works.\\nThere is no single brain area\\nthat flips the switch for aggression.\\nAlthough we'll soon talk\\nabout a brain structure\\nthat generally houses the propensity\\nand the output of aggression.\\nThis notion of a hydraulic\\npressure that can drive us\\ntoward aggressive behavior\\nor conversely can be\\nvery low pressure and keep us\\nin a state of non-reactivity,\\nmaybe even passivity or submissiveness\\nis a very important feature\\nbecause it really captures\\nthe essence of how neural circuits work\\nwhen we're talking about\\nprimitive behaviors generally.\\nAnd you can start to notice\\nthis in yourself and in others,\\nyou can start to notice\\nwhen you are veering\\ntoward aggression or\\nwhen someone is veering\\ntoward aggression, verbal or physical.\\nNow that veering is the buildup\\nof this hydraulic pressure\\nthat Lorenz was referring to,\\nand it really does have an\\nunderlying biological basis.\\nNow it was some years later\\nthat the first experiments\\ncame along, which really\\nstarted to identify\\nthe brain areas and the\\nbiological so-called pressures\\nthat can induce aggressive behavior.\\nAnd the person that really\\ngets credit for this\\nis a guy by the name of Walter Hess,\\nwho at that time was working on cats.\\nAnd I know that when say working on cats,\\na lot of people will cringe.\\nA lot of people have cats as pets,\\nand certainly cats can be delightful.\\nSome people like them more,\\nsome people like them less.\\nMost people cringe at the idea\\nof doing experiments on cats.\\nI should say that these days,\\nvery few laboratories work on cats.\\nMost laboratories that\\nwork on animal models\\nwill work on flies, Drosophila fruit flies\\nfor their capacity to do genetics,\\non laboratory mice, sometimes\\nrats, but usually mice.\\nAnd occasionally you'll find a\\nlab that still works on cats.\\nBack in the time of Hess,\\nvery few laboratories\\nworked on mice, most laboratories\\nworked on cats or rats.\\nAnd the reason for that is\\nnowadays most laboratories\\nuse mice if they use animal models\\nbecause of the genetic\\ntools that exist in mice\\nto knock out this gene or\\nknock in this gene, et cetera,\\nwhich can't be done in\\nhumans or non-human primates,\\nat least not very easily\\nat this point in history.\\nSo when I say he was working on cats,\\nI realized that probably\\nevokes some negative emotions\\nin some of you, maybe even\\naggression in some of you,\\nwhat we can do, however,\\nis look at the data\\nand make use of the data in\\nterms of our understanding.\\nWhat Hess did was he\\nhad cats that were awake\\nand he was able to lower\\na stimulating electrode\\ninto their brain.\\nNow keep in mind that the brain\\ndoes not have any pain sensors.\\nSo after a small hole\\nis made in the skull,\\nelectrodes are lowered into the brain.\\nThis is what's done commonly\\nin human neurosurgery.\\nAnd he was able to stimulate\\ndifferent brain areas\\nand he was sort of poking around.\\nAnd when I say sort of,\\nhe was doing this with\\nsome logical intent and purpose,\\nhe wasn't just poking\\naround in there for fun.\\nHe was trying to identify brain\\nregions that could generate\\nentire categories of\\nbehavior, ALA Lorenz, right?\\nThese fixed action pattern behaviors.\\nEventually his electrode landed in a site\\nand he provided electrical\\nstimulation to the cat\\nthat caused this otherwise\\npassive purring relaxing cat\\nto suddenly go into an absolute rage.\\nSo arched back, hissing hair up.\\nSo called piloerection,\\nwhere the hairs go up,\\nanimals try to make\\nthemselves as big as possible\\noften when they're aggressive.\\nDrooling, maybe even\\nspitting, believe it or not,\\ncats and other animals can do this.\\nAnd the cat tried to\\nattack him or anyone else,\\nand anything else, even inanimate objects\\nwhen he stimulated this\\nparticula brain area.\\nSo Hess obviously took notice\\nof this incredible\\ntransformation in behavior.\\nAnd the fact that when he\\nturned off the stimulation\\nof this particular brain area,\\nthe cat very quickly within seconds,\\nwent back to being passive calm kitty.\\nNow, of course, he repeated\\nthis experiment in other animals\\nbecause he had to confirm that\\nit wasn't just happenstance,\\nthat there wasn't something\\nunique about this one cat\\nthat perhaps he had stimulated an area\\nthat had been built up during\\nthe kittenhood of this cat\\nand had been reactivated.\\nMaybe this kitten had been\\ntraumatized early in life\\nor scared and reactivation\\nof a particular circuit,\\nunique to that cat created\\nthis aggressive behavior.\\nThat wasn't the case,\\nevery cat that he looked at\\nand stimulated this particular brain area,\\nthe cat would immediately\\ngo into an aggressive,\\nalmost rage type behavior.\\nNow, of course we can't anthropomorphize.\\nWe don't know what the cat was feeling.\\nFor all we know the cat could be happy,\\nalthough that seems pretty unlikely\\nand later experiments done in mice,\\nbut also in humans confirm that indeed,\\nstimulation of this brain area evoked\\nnot just behavioral aggression,\\nbut also subjective feelings\\nof aggression and anger.\\nSo what was this incredible brain area,\\nor rather, I should say,\\nwhat is the brain area\\nthat harbored this incredible capacity\\nto generate aggressive\\nbehavior in Hess's experiments?\\nWell, for those of you\\nthat are regular listeners\\nof this podcast, you'll\\nprobably be relieved to know\\nthat today we're going to talk\\nabout some new neural circuits,\\noftentimes we'll center\\nback on the amygdala\\nor the prefrontal cortex,\\nand those names will come up.\\nAnd for those of you that\\nhaven't heard them before,\\ndon't worry, I'll make it clear as to what\\nthose brain areas are and what they do.\\nBut today we're going to talk a lot about\\nthe so-called VMH or\\nventromedial hypothalamus.\\nThe ventromedial\\nhypothalamus is a nucleus,\\nmeaning a small collection of neurons...\\nWhat are neurons?\\nNerve cells, and that\\nsmall collection of neurons\\nthat we call the ventromedial\\nhypothalamus is truly small.\\nIt's only about 1,500 neurons\\non one side of your brain\\nand a matching 1,500 neurons\\non the other side of your brain\\nand that combined 3000 neurons\\nor so, it's not exactly 3000,\\nbut 3000 neurons or so\\nis sufficient to generate\\naggressive behavior of the sort\\nthat Hess observed in the\\ncat, and believe it or not,\\nwhen you see somebody\\nwho's in an act of rage\\nor in an act of verbal aggression\\nor in an act of defensive aggression,\\nprotecting their family or loved\\nones or country, et cetera,\\nalmost certainly those neurons\\nare engaged in that behavior.\\nThose neurons are perhaps\\neven generating that behavior.\\nAnd next I'll describe some\\nexperiments that were done\\njust recently within\\nthe last 10 years or so,\\nbut leading right up until this year\\nand even last month that keep confirming\\nagain and again and again,\\nthat it is the activity of neurons\\nin the ventromedial hypothalamus\\nthat are both necessary\\nand sufficient to\\ngenerate the full catalog\\nof aggressive behaviors.\\nNow, before I go further to describe\\nthe beautiful recent studies on the VMH,\\nthe ventromedial hypothalamus,\\nand the important role of testosterone,\\nand more importantly, estrogen,\\nin the activation of aggressive\\nbehavior, that's right.\\nThat's soon to be clear to\\nyou why that's the case.\\nI want to emphasize that the\\nventromedial hypothalamus\\nis something that we\\nshould all care about.\\nWhy?\\nWell, it turns out that many categories\\nof psychiatric disorders,\\ndevelopmental disorders,\\nand psychological challenges,\\nthings like schizophrenia,\\nPTSD, post-traumatic stress\\ndisorder, depression,\\nborderline personality disorder,\\nand even certain forms of\\nautism can include elements\\nof aggression and even violence.\\nNow it's certainly not the case\\nthat aggression and violence\\nare present in all people\\nwho suffer from schizophrenia\\nor PTSD or depression or autism\\nor borderline personality disorder.\\nI'm absolutely not saying that.\\nHowever, it can be a feature of those.\\nAnd it's a well described feature\\nin terms of trying to\\nunderstand the constellation\\nof challenges that people suffer\\nfrom when they have those.\\nSo thinking about the VMH goes\\nway beyond just understanding\\nbasic aggression in the\\ncontext of adaptive aggression.\\nSo, you know, when\\nearlier I use the example,\\nmaternal aggression, that's one\\nadaptive form of aggression.\\nIt also can be pathologic aggression,\\nmeaning it can harm ourselves or others.\\nSo keep this in mind as we go forward,\\nbecause later we're going\\nto talk about specific tools\\ndesigned to modulate or prevent\\naggression in, for instance,\\npeople with attention deficit\\nhyperactivity disorder,\\nand especially kids with ADHD.\\nIn the meantime, let's return to the VMH,\\nthis relatively small\\ncollection of neurons.\\nAnd the reason I say\\nrelatively small is, well,\\nyour brain has many hundreds\\nof billions of neurons,\\nmaybe even trillions of neurons,\\nthe exact number of\\nneurons isn't really clear,\\nbut it's a lot.\\nAnd it certainly is a lot\\nrelative to the number of neurons\\nthis 3000 or so neurons\\nliving in your hypothalamus\\nthat can evoke this aggressive response.\\nExperiments done by David\\nAnderson's lab at Caltech\\nwere really the first to\\nparse the fine circuitry\\nand to really show that the\\nventromedial hypothalamus\\nis both necessary and sufficient\\nfor aggressive behavior.\\nThese are important experiments\\nand they're worth knowing about.\\nWhat they did was they\\nidentified, first of all,\\nwhere the ventromedial\\nhypothalamus was in the mouse,\\nthat was pretty straightforward\\nto do was sort of known\\nbefore they started these experiments.\\nAnd then they analyzed which\\ngenes, meaning which DNA,\\nwhich of course becomes RNA\\nand RNA becomes protein,\\nwhich DNA and therefore\\nwhich proteins are expressed\\nin particular cells of the\\nventromedial hypothalamus.\\nAnd it turns out that\\nthere's a particular category\\nof neurons in the\\nventromedial hypothalamus\\nthat make an estrogen receptor.\\nAnd it is those neurons in\\nparticular that are responsible\\nfor generating aggressive behavior.\\nHow did they know this?\\nWell, they used a tool that's\\nactually been described\\nby a previous guest of this podcast.\\nWe had an episode with the\\npsychiatrist and bioengineer\\nand my colleague at\\nStanford School of Medicine,\\nKarl Deisseroth, he and\\nothers have developed tools\\nthat allow people to control\\nthe activity of neurons\\nessentially by remote control,\\nby shining light on those neurons.\\nSo in the context of an\\nexperiment on a mouse,\\nwhich is what David's\\nlab did, and these were\\nthe beautiful experiments of Dayu Lin\\nwho's now in her own laboratory\\nat New York University,\\nput a little fiber optic\\ncable down into the brain\\ninto the hypothalamus\\nthat is of the mouse.\\nThe mouse is able to move around\\nin its cage freely moving,\\neven though it has a little\\ntether, this little wire,\\nit's a very thin wire.\\nAnd that little thin wire is actually\\na little what we call optrode.\\nAnd the experimentalist\\nin this case, Dayu,\\nwas able to stimulate the turning on\\nof a little bit of blue\\nlight and that blue light\\nactivated only those\\nestrogen receptor neurons\\nin only the ventromedial hypothalamus\\nand the way she was able to do that,\\nis she had introduced a\\ngene that had been developed\\nby our friend, Karl\\nDeisseroth that allows light\\nto trigger electrical\\nactivity in those neurons.\\nSo if any of that is confusing,\\nor if all of that is confusing,\\nhere's the experiment.\\nThere's a mouse in a cage.\\nIt has a little wire\\ncoming out of its head.\\nIt doesn't notice, believe it or not.\\nWe know this 'cause it's\\nstill eating and mating\\nand doing all the things\\nthat mics like to do\\non a daily basis and sleeping, et cetera.\\nAnd the mere pressing of\\na button will activate\\na little bit of light released\\nat the end of that wire,\\nthat light activates particular\\nneurons in this case,\\nit's the estrogen receptor\\ncontaining neurons\\nin only the ventromedial hypothalamus.\\nWhen that mouse is in a\\ncage with another mouse,\\na couple of things happen depending on\\nwhat the other mouse is, or we could say\\nwho the other mouse is.\\nIf it's a male mouse and you put in there\\nwith a female mouse, the male\\nmouse will attempt to mate\\nwith a female mouse\\nprovided that the male mouse\\nhas gone through puberty.\\nHe will try to mount and\\nmate with the female mouse.\\nNow female mice are either\\nin a receptive phase\\nor a non-receptive phase of\\ntheir so-called estrous cycle.\\nThey don't have a menstrual 28 day cycle\\nThey have an estrous cycle.\\nAnd on particular days\\nof the estrous cycle,\\nthey are not happy to mate.\\nThey will basically\\nkeep their hindquarters\\naway from the male mouse at all costs.\\nThey'll even attack the male mouse.\\nOn certain days of the\\nestrous cycle, however,\\nthe female mouse will undergo\\nwhat's called lordosis,\\nwhich is an arching of her\\nback and she'll allow the male\\nto mount and mate with her.\\nSo a large number of\\nexperiments were done,\\nbut the first experiment really\\nwas to put the male mouse\\nin with a female mouse\\nwho's in the so-called\\nreceptive phase of estrus.\\nThat is, she will allow mating\\nand he starts mating with her\\nand they go through\\nthe standard repertoire\\nof mating behaviors that\\nyou observe in mice:\\nmounting, thrusting,\\nintromission as it's called\\nin the mouse sex world.\\nWell, I guess I don't know\\nwhat the mice call it,\\nbut that's what the experimenters call it.\\nAnd then afterwards that\\nhe will dismount, okay.\\nSo they observe this kind\\nof mounting and sex behavior\\nis very typical, but about\\nhalfway through the behavior,\\nDayu turned on the light to stimulate\\nthese estrogen receptor containing neurons\\nonly in the male mouse\\nand what she observed\\nwas incredibly dramatic.\\nThe male mouse ceases from trying to mate\\nwith the female mouse\\nand immediately tries\\nto kill the female mouse.\\nHe starts attacking her.\\nThen she turns off the\\nlight, the male stops\\nand goes back to trying to\\nmate with the female mouse.\\nSo I'm sure all of this was very confusing\\nand disturbing to the female mouse.\\nNonetheless, that was the repertoire.\\nThey would mate.\\nShe would stimulate these\\nventromedial hypothalamus neurons.\\nThe male mouse would\\nimmediately try and attack\\nand kill the female mouse.\\nAnd then she would stop the stimulation\\nand he would stop trying\\nto attack and kill\\nthe female mouse, return\\nto the attempt, at least,\\nto mate with the female mouse.\\nThese are such dramatic shifts in behavior\\ntriggered only by the\\nactivation of only the small set\\nof neurons within the\\nventromedial hypothalamus.\\nAnd for those of you that think\\nthat you can watch this sort of thing\\nwithout being disturbed, I\\nencourage you to go to YouTube.\\nWe will provide a link\\nwhere you can see a video\\nof this type of behavior.\\nIt's incredibly dramatic.\\nThe shift in behavior\\nis almost instantaneous,\\noccurs within seconds,\\nif not milliseconds,\\nthousandths of a second.\\nThe next experiment that she\\ndid was to put a male mouse\\nwith this stimulation\\nwith light capability\\nin its ventromedial\\nhypothalamus into a cage alone,\\nbut with a rubber glove\\nfilled with air or water.\\nMouse, walking around sniffing, peeing,\\nwhich is what male mice seem to do.\\nThey seem to urinate\\neverywhere, that's actually\\nan interesting, perhaps\\ninteresting feature of male mice\\nand actually many male\\nanimals, perhaps even humans.\\nWe don't know, or maybe we do know,\\nbasically this has been an\\nobserved time and time again\\nin experiments, mainly\\nby Lisa Stowers's lab\\nat the Scripps Institute,\\nthat's characterized this.\\nIf you put female mice\\ninto an arena or a cage,\\nthey always urinate in a very\\nsmall corner of that cage.\\nWhereas if you put mail mice\\ninto an arena or a cage,\\nthe urinate everywhere,\\nthey have this obsession\\nwith spraying their urine everywhere,\\nyou can transpose that to\\nhuman behavior if you like.\\nIn any event, Dayu put the\\nmouse in the cage alone,\\nbut with this rubber glove,\\nthe mouse is walking around\\nurinating, et cetera,\\ndoing whatever is that mice do,\\nthen she stimulates the activation\\nof these ventromedial\\nhypothalamus neurons,\\nand the mouse immediately\\ntries to kill the glove.\\nIt goes into a rage, attacking the glove\\nas if it were another mouse\\nor some other animate object.\\nBut of course it's an inanimate object.\\nIt's just a rubber glove.\\nShe stops the stimulation and the mouse\\nimmediately goes back\\nto being completely calm\\nor at least not attacking.\\nAgain, we don't know what\\nthe mouse was feeling.\\nSo these are very dramatic videos.\\nAgain, you can see them\\nby following the link\\nthat we'll provide in the caption.\\nIf that sort of thing\\nis going to disturb you,\\nby to see, for instance, the attack,\\none mouse attacking another,\\nplease just don't watch them.\\nI'm not interested in traumatizing anybody\\nor you traumatizing yourself, that is.\\nA number of different variations\\nwere done on this experiment.\\nFor instance, stimulating\\nthe VMH in female mice,\\nas opposed to male mice,\\nputting the female mice\\nin with other female mice\\nor with other male mice,\\nno matter what variation\\none carries out, so it doesn't matter\\nif it's male with female, male with male,\\nfemale with female, et cetera,\\nstimulation of the\\nventromedial hypothalamus\\nin a male mouse or a female\\nmouse evokes this very dramatic,\\nalmost instantaneous aggressive behavior,\\nphysically aggressive behavior.\\nSubsequent experiments done by Dayu Lin\\nin her own laboratory\\nand other laboratories\\nhave shown that the ventromedial\\nhypothalamus connected\\nwith a bunch of other brain\\nareas that are interesting,\\nAnd I'll talk about some\\nof those in a little bit,\\nbut one of them that\\nI want to call out now\\nis the so-called PAG, the\\nperiaqueductal gray nucleus.\\nThis is a large structure\\nin the back of the brain\\nthat houses things like neurons\\nthat can create opioids.\\nWe all know of the opioid\\ncrisis, but these are neurons\\nthat can produce endogenous,\\nmeans made by the body,\\nchemicals that can cause pain relief.\\nYou could understand why that might occur\\nin a circuit for aggression, right?\\nEven if one is the aggressor, it's likely\\nthat they may incur some physical damage\\nand they'd want some pain relief.\\nThe PAG also is connected to a number\\nof neural circuits that eventually,\\nthrough several processing\\nstations, excuse me,\\narrive at things like the jaws.\\nAnd in fact, stimulation of\\nthe ventromedial hypothalamus\\ncan evoke biting and\\naggressive biting behavior.\\nNow aggressive biting behavior\\nis particularly interesting\\nbecause in humans and\\nespecially in human children,\\nbiting is something that,\\nwhile young children might do\\nas a form of aggression,\\ntends to disappear\\npretty early in childhood.\\nAnd if it doesn't, it's often\\nseen as a mark of pathology.\\nI have a story about this,\\nactually, when I was a kid,\\nI went to a summer sports camp\\nand I'll never forget this,\\nso we're playing soccer and\\nin a rare stroke of luck\\nor accident, I happened to score a goal.\\nI wasn't a particularly\\ngood soccer player,\\nespecially not at that stage of my life.\\nThey later figured out\\nthat it was just better\\nto make me a fullback, 'cause\\nI could just wait there\\nand do what fullbacks do.\\nI was better at taking\\nthe ball or the person out\\nthan I was putting the ball in the goal.\\nNonetheless, I, again,\\nby chance, scored a goal\\nand I was trotting back\\nto my side of the field,\\nand all of a sudden I felt\\nthis sting in my back,\\na kid, not to be named, although\\nI do remember your name,\\nI'm not going to tell\\nyou what his name was.\\nA kid jumped on my back and\\nbit me on the top of my back.\\nAnd this of course resulted\\nin a discussion and a timeout\\nand all the usual things and\\nparents I think got involved.\\nI don't recall, I didn't\\nthink much else of it,\\nbut I recall that this was\\nconsidered especially troubling\\nbehavior because he bit\\nme as opposed to hit me\\nor shoved me down or something that sort,\\nand it does seem as if\\nthe tendency to use biting\\nas an aggressive behavior is associated\\nwith a more primitive circuitry.\\nNow here I'm truly anthropomorphizing.\\nI don't know what this other\\nkid happened to be thinking\\nor feeling at the time, how could I?\\nAnd I certainly am not going to say\\nthat biting in every case\\nreflects a pathology,\\nalthough I think there\\nis general agreement\\nin the psychology community,\\nin the psychiatric community\\nthat past a certain age,\\nthe using of one's teeth to\\nimpart aggression and damage\\non others is a particularly\\nprimitive and troubling\\nor at least for the observer\\nor the person experiencing\\nis a pretty disturbing event.\\nDayu's lab has shown that activation\\nof the ventromedial hypothalamus triggers\\na downstream circuit in\\nthe periaqueductal gray\\nwhich then triggers a whole\\nother set of circuits of fixed\\naction patterns.\\nHere we are back to Lorenz\\nwith fixed action patterns,\\nincluding swinging of the\\nlimbs, right punching.\\nAnd this wouldn't necessarily\\nbe controlled punching,\\nbut also biting behavior.\\nSo it's remarkable to me,\\nat least that we have circuits\\nin our brain that can evoke\\nviolent use of things like\\nour mouth or violent use of\\nthings like our limbs.\\nThat of course could be used\\nfor things like singing or\\nkissing or eating or, you know,\\ngesticulating in any kind\\nof polite or impolite way.\\nThe point here is that neural circuits,\\nnot individual brain areas\\nevoke the constellation\\nof behaviors that we call aggression.\\nNow, many of you are probably\\npuzzled or at least should be\\nbecause I've been talking about\\nthis highly specialized brain area,\\nthe ventromedial hypothalamus\\nand this highly specialized\\nsubcategory of neurons in the\\nventromedial hypothalamus,\\nthese neurons that make\\nestrogen receptors.\\nAnd yet the activation of those cells\\ntriggers dramatic and\\nimmediate aggression,\\nboth in males and in females and both\\nagainst males and against females.\\nSo what's going on here?\\nMost of us think about\\nestrogen and we don't\\nimmediately think of aggression.\\nMost of us hear testosterone and we might\\nthink about aggression,\\nalthough other things as well.\\nIn order to understand this, I\\njust want to briefly refer back\\nto a conversation that I had\\non a previous episode of\\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast.\\nAnd that was with my colleague,\\nthe great Robert Sapolsky\\nof course, is a professor at Stanford\\nwho studied testosterone\\nand its impacts on behavior\\nas well as estrogen and other hormones\\nand their impacts on behavior.\\nTo make a long story short and to dispel\\na still unfortunately very common myth.\\nTestosterone does not\\nincrease aggressiveness,\\ntestosterone increases\\nproactivity and the willingness\\nto lean into effort in\\ncompetitive scenarios.\\nSometimes this is referred to\\nas the challenge hypothesis,\\nbut to make a long story short,\\nif people are given testosterone,\\nor if you look at people\\nwho have different levels,\\nexcuse me, of testosterone,\\nendogenously that they naturally make.\\nWhat you'll find is that\\ntestosterone tends to increase\\ncompetitiveness, but not\\njust in aggressive scenarios.\\nSo if somebody is already aggressive,\\ngiving them testosterone\\nwill have the tendency\\nto make them more aggressive.\\nIf somebody however is very\\nbenevolent and altruistic,\\ngiving them testosterone will\\nmake them more benevolent\\nand altruistic, at least up to a point.\\nNow, of course there are certain forms\\nof synthetic testosterones that\\nare known in sports circles\\nand in other circles to\\nincrease aggressiveness\\nbecause of the way those particular forms\\nof synthetic testosterones work.\\nBut in general, most of the experiments\\nthat I'm referring to have\\nnot been done using those,\\nthey've been done using\\nthe let's call them\\nthe more traditional biological\\nforms of testosterone\\nor that resemble the biological\\nforms of testosterone.\\nIn fact, Robert Sapolsky described\\na really interesting experiment in which,\\nif you look at testosterone\\nlevels or you administer\\nadditional testosterone to people\\nwho are doing philanthropy,\\ngiving money to organizations\\nand so they're essentially doing good\\nbecause these are\\norganizations doing good.\\nWhat you find is that\\nincreased testosterone\\nor further increasing\\ntestosterone makes people\\nmore willing to compete,\\nto give more money\\nthan the other person\\nin the room in order,\\nyou know, to put it in air quotes,\\n\\\"To Alpha out the other\\nperson,\\\" by giving more money.\\nSo this is an act of altruistic\\nor benevolent philanthropy.\\nIt is not an act of aggression.\\nOf course, we don't know what the people\\nare feeling underneath all that.\\nAgain, we can't\\nanthropomorphize or project\\nonto other people what they're feeling.\\nBut the point is that testosterone itself\\ndoes not make people more aggressive.\\nAnd in the experiments that\\nwe've been talking about\\nup until now, it's actually the activation\\nof estrogen receptor containing neurons\\nthat makes these animals more aggressive.\\nAnd it turns out there's\\nevidence that in certain context,\\nestrogen can make people more aggressive.\\nSo what's going on here?\\nWell, what's going on is that\\ntestosterone can be converted\\ninto estrogen through a\\nprocess called aromatization.\\nThere's an enzyme called aromatase.\\nAnytime you have word that ends in A-S-E,\\nat least if it's in\\nthe context of biology,\\nit's almost always not always,\\nbut almost always an enzyme.\\nSo the aromatase enzyme converts\\ntestosterone into estrogen,\\nand it is actually\\ntestosterone, aromatized,\\nconverted into estrogen and then binding\\nto these estrogen containing neurons\\nin the ventromedial hypothalamus\\nthat triggers aggression.\\nI want to repeat that, it\\nis not testosterone itself,\\nthat triggers aggression.\\nIt is testosterone aromatized\\ninto estrogen within the brain\\nand binding to these estrogen\\nreceptor containing neurons\\nin the ventromedial hypothalamus\\nthat evokes aggression\\nand dramatic aggression at that.\\nNow this effect of estrogen\\ncausing aggression in the brain\\nis very robust, so much so\\nthat if you take a mouse\\nthat lacks the aromatase enzyme or a human\\nthat lacks the aromatase\\nenzyme, and they do exist,\\nthen there is a reduction\\nin overall aggression,\\ndespite high levels of testosterone.\\nAnd if people who or mice who\\nhave the aromatase enzyme have\\nthat enzyme blocked, well,\\nthen it doesn't matter\\nhow much you increase testosterone\\nor any of its other derivatives.\\nYou do not observe this aggression.\\nSo this runs counter to\\neverything that we know and think\\nabout the role of testosterone.\\nAgain, testosterone\\nincreases competitiveness.\\nIt can increase the desire\\nto work under challenge.\\nI've said it before, and I ran this\\nor pressure tested this\\nagainst Robert Sapolsky\\nwho's been working on\\ntestosterone and it's role\\nin the brain and behavior\\nfor many decades now.\\nIt is fair to say that\\ntestosterone has the net effect\\nof making effort feel good,\\nor at least increasing\\nthe threshold at which effort\\nfeels bad or unsustainable.\\nAnd it does that by way\\nof changing the activity\\nor the threshold for\\nactivation of brain structures,\\nlike the amygdala and\\nother brain structures\\nassociated with anxiety.\\nSo the next time somebody says,\\ntestosterone makes people aggressive.\\nYou can say, \\\"Ah, no,\\nactually it's estrogen\\nthat makes people aggressive,\\nand animals aggressive\\nfor that matter.\\nNow of course it is the\\ncase that because males\\nhave relatively less estrogen circulating\\nin their brain and body\\nthan females, right?\\nBecause they have testes, not ovaries,\\nthat testosterone is\\nrequired in the first place\\nin order to be converted into estrogen,\\nto activate this aggressive\\ncircuit involving\\nthese estrogen receptor containing neurons\\nin the ventromedial hypothalamus.\\nBut nonetheless, it is estrogen\\nthat is the final step.\\nIt is the hormone on\\nwhich aggression hinges.\\nAnd I think for most people,\\nthat's a quite surprising finding.\\nAnd yet this is perhaps one\\nof the more robust findings\\nin both the animal and human\\nliterature, as it relates\\nto hormones and psychological\\nstates and behavior.\\nNow, of course it is the case\\nthat if testosterone is low,\\nthat a person or an animal will exhibit\\nless aggressive behavior, but that's not\\nbecause of reduced testosterone per se.\\nIt's because of the subsequent\\nreduction in testosterone,\\nmeaning if there's no\\ntestosterone to aromatize\\ninto estrogen, estrogen\\nwill also be lower.\\nSo we've established that\\nit's not testosterone,\\nbut testosterone converted into estrogen\\nthat activates these\\ncircuits for aggression.\\nBut nonetheless, it's\\nstill surprising, right?\\nI mean, most of us don't\\nthink about estrogen\\nas the hormone that stimulates aggression,\\nbut it turns out it's all contextual.\\nThere are beautiful data\\nshowing that whether or not\\nestrogen stimulates aggression,\\ncan be powerfully modulated\\nby whether or not days are\\nshort or days are long.\\nIn other words, whether or not\\nhere's a lot of sunshine or not.\\nNow, obviously brain is encased in skull.\\nSo it doesn't really know\\nif there's a lot of sunshine\\nout there even though you can\\nsee the sun with your eyes,\\nyou can feel it on your skin.\\nDay length is converted\\ninto hormonal signals\\nand chemical signals\\nand the primary hormonal\\nand chemical signals involve\\nmelatonin and dopamine\\nand also the stress hormones.\\nSo to make a very long story short,\\nin the long days where\\nwe get a lot of sunlight,\\nboth in our eyes and on our skin,\\nmelatonin levels are reduced.\\nMelatonin is a hormone\\nthat tends to produce\\nstates of sleepiness and quiescence.\\nIt also tends to activate\\npathways that tend to reduce\\nthings like breeding and sexual behavior.\\nIn long days, dopamine is increased.\\nDopamine is a molecule associated\\nwith feelings of wellbeing\\nand motivation and the desire to seek out\\nall sorts of things, all\\nsorts of motivated behaviors.\\nAnd in long days provided\\nwe're getting enough sunlight\\non our skin and to our\\neyes, the stress hormones,\\nespecially cortisol, and some of the other\\nstress hormones are reduced in levels.\\nIf estrogen levels are\\nincreased experimentally\\nunder long day conditions,\\nit does not evoke aggression.\\nHowever, in short days,\\nif estrogen is increased,\\nthere's a heightened\\npredisposition for aggression.\\nAnd that makes perfect sense.\\nIf you think about what short days do\\nto the biology of your brain and body.\\nIn short days, the\\nmelatonin signal goes up.\\nThere's more melatonin circulating\\nfor more of each 24 hour cycle.\\nStress hormones are circulating more.\\nWhy? Short days tend to\\nbe associated with winter.\\nIn winter, we are bombarded\\nwith more bacterial viruses\\nbecause bacterial viruses actually survive\\nbetter in cold than they do in heat.\\nIn fact, in my laboratory, we work with\\na lot of viruses and\\nbacteria and when we want\\nto keep them alive, we\\nput them in the freezer.\\nIf we want to kill them, if\\nwe want to inoculate them,\\nwe put them under UV light.\\nLike you would see from the sunlight.\\nSo shorter days are\\nconducive to aggression.\\nNot because days are short per se,\\nbut because stress\\nhormone levels are higher\\nand because dopamine levels are lower.\\nNow, here's where all of\\nthis starts to converge\\non a very clear biological picture,\\na very clear psychological\\npicture, and indeed\\na very clear set of tools that\\nwe can think about and use.\\nUnder conditions where cortisol is high,\\nwhere this stress hormone is\\nelevated and under conditions\\nwhere the neuromodulator\\nserotonin is reduced\\nthere is a greater propensity for estrogen\\nto trigger aggression.\\nNow, again, I know I've said it before,\\nbut for males who make\\na lot of testosterone\\nrelative to estrogen, you\\nhave to swap in your mind\\nthis idea that if testosterone is high,\\nthat means that estrogen is low because\\nwhile that can be true in\\nthe periphery in the body,\\nif testosterone is high,\\nthere is going to be\\nsome aromatization, that conversion of\\ntestosterone to estrogen.\\nSo anytime you hear that\\ntestosterone is high,\\nyou should think testosterone\\nis high in the body\\nand perhaps estrogen is low in the body.\\nBut that means that there's\\ngoing to be heightened levels\\nof estrogen in the brain and therefore\\nincreased propensity for aggression.\\nIn females who generally\\nmake less testosterone\\nrelative to estrogen, there\\nis sufficient estrogen\\nalready present to trigger aggression.\\nSo both males and females\\nare primed for aggression,\\nbut that's riding on a\\ncontext and that context\\nof whether or not you get a\\ntendency for aggression or not.\\ndepends on whether or not\\ncortisol is high or low,\\nand I'm telling you that if\\ncortisol is relatively higher\\nin any individual, there's\\ngoing to be a tilt,\\nan increase in that hydraulic\\npressure that Lorenz talked\\nabout toward aggression.\\nAnd if serotonin, the\\nneuromodulator that is associated\\nwith feelings of wellbeing and sometimes\\neven of slight passivity,\\nbut certainly of wellbeing,\\nif serotonin is low, there's\\nalso going to be a further shift\\ntowards an aggressive tendency.\\nSo if we return to Lorenz's\\nhydraulic pressure model\\nof aggression in other internal states,\\nwe realize that external\\nstimuli, things that we hear,\\nthings that we see, for instance,\\nsomeone saying something upsetting or us,\\nseeing somebody do something\\nthat we don't like to others\\nor to us, as well as our internal state,\\nour subjective feelings of wellbeing,\\nbut also our stress level,\\nour feelings of whether or\\nnot we have enough resources\\nand are content with what we have.\\nAll of that is converging on this thing\\nthat we call internal state and creating\\nthis pressure of either to be\\nmore aggressive or less aggressive.\\nAnd now we have some major players feeding\\ninto that final pathway.\\nThat question of whether or not\\nwill we hit the other,\\nperson, will we say the thing\\nthat is considered aggressive?\\nWill we not say it?\\nIf somebody says something\\nor does something\\naggressive to us, will\\nwe respond or will we be\\nsubmissive or even passive?\\nAgain, there are many things\\nfunneling into that question\\nand dictating whether\\nor not the answer is,\\n\\\"Absolutely I'll fight back,\\\"\\nor, \\\"I'm going to attack\\nthem even unprovoked.\\\"\\nOr if they say this, I'm going to do that,\\nor no matter what they do,\\nI'm not going to respond.\\nThese kinds of things are very complex.\\nAnd yet we really can boil them down\\nto just a few common elements.\\nAnd I'm telling you that those\\nelements are whether or not\\ncortisol levels are relatively\\nlower or relatively higher.\\nAgain, relatively higher is going to tend\\nto make people more reactive.\\nWhy?\\nBecause reactivity is really a function\\nof the autonomic nervous system,\\nwhich is sort of like a\\nseesaw that oscillates\\nbetween the so-called sympathetic arm\\nof the autonomic nervous system,\\nwhich tends to put us\\ninto a state of readiness\\nthrough the release of adrenaline.\\nCortisol and adrenaline\\nwhen they're circulating\\nthe brain and body, make\\nus more likely to move\\nand to react and to speak.\\nIt's actually what will induce\\na kind of low level tremor,\\nwhich is an anticipatory tremor to be able\\nto move more quickly, right?\\nA body in motion is more\\neasily set into further motion,\\nthat is, and the neuromodulator serotonin\\nis a neuromodulator that\\nin general is associated\\nwith feelings of wellbeing in response\\nto what we already have.\\nSo when we are well fed,\\nserotonin tends to be released\\nin our brain and body,\\nin particular, well\\nfed with carbohydrates,\\nthe precursor to serotonin is tryptophan.\\nAnd indeed there are nice studies\\nexploring the types of\\ndiets, nutritional programs\\nthat can reduce aggressive\\nbehavior, both in children\\nand in adults and tryptophan-rich diets\\nor supplementation with tryptophan.\\nSo for tryptophan rich diets,\\nthings like white turkey meat,\\nbut then there are also\\na number of carbohydrates\\nyou can look up.\\nIt's very easy to find foods\\nthat contain lots of tryptophan.\\nThose foods contain the\\nprecursor to serotonin.\\nNow it isn't simply the\\ncase that eating more foods\\nwith tryptophan will tend\\nto reduce your aggression.\\nI suppose it could do that,\\nif you ate it in abundance,\\nit could make you tired\\nand then you're less likely\\nto be aggressive, I don't\\nrecommend that strategy,\\nbut the idea here is that\\nwhen it's been explored,\\nincreasing levels of tryptophan\\neither by supplementation\\nor by food or drugs, prescription drugs\\nthat increase serotonin.\\nSo for instance, fluoxetine\\nsometimes called Prozac\\nor Zoloft or any number of the other SSRIs\\ntend to reduce aggressive behavior.\\nNow, not always, but in\\ngeneral, that's the case.\\nSimilarly, because elevated cortisol tends\\nto shift the whole\\nsystem, again, create more\\nof a hydraulic pressure\\ntowards aggressive states.\\nIf cortisol levels are\\nreduced, well then the tendency\\nfor aggressive behavior is reduced.\\nThis is supported by a number\\nof peer reviewed studies.\\nWe'll provide links to some of those\\nin the caption show notes.\\nAnd we're going to return to\\nthese a bit later in the context\\nof specific studies that have\\nlooked at genetic variants\\nin different individuals that cause them\\nto make more or less serotonin,\\nor at least to metabolize\\nserotonin differently.\\nThis is also the case for so-called\\nintermittent explosive disorder\\nthat can often be associated\\nwith gene variants that control\\nhow much serotonin is made\\nor how it's metabolized or\\nhow much cortisol is made\\nand how much it's metabolized.\\nIn thinking about tools\\nthat are a number of things\\nthat one could consider.\\nFirst of all, there are a\\nnumber of decent studies\\nexploring how supplementation\\nwith the Omega-3 fatty acids,\\nwhich are precursors of some\\nof the transmitter systems,\\nincluding serotonin that can\\nmodulate not directly mediate,\\nbut modulate mood and emotional\\ntone supplementation with\\nthe omega 3 S has been shown\\nto reduce impulsivity and\\naggressiveness in certain\\ncontexts in things like ADHD\\nor in individuals who\\nhave a predisposition\\nfor aggressive type behavior\\nor aggressive thinking.\\nNow that doesn't necessarily\\nmean that the omega 3\\nfatty acids are going directly\\nto the ventromedial hypothalamus\\nand changing the activity\\nof neurons there more likely they are\\ncausing or modulating\\nan overall shift in mood\\nthrough the immune system,\\nthrough hormone systems that are\\nchanging the overall tone or\\nthe propensity for neurons\\nin the ventromedial\\nhypothalamus to be activated.\\nHow much omega 3 fatty acid, what source?\\nWell, we've talked about\\nthis on the podcast before.\\nYou can, of course get omega 3 fatty acids\\nfrom a number of different foods.\\nGetting them from whole foods\\nis probably the best way\\nto do it, but many people,\\nincluding people with depression\\nwill often supplement\\nwith one gram or more\\nof omega 3 fatty acid per day.\\nSome people including myself\\nwill take them every day\\nas just a general mood enhancer.\\nI don't suffer from depression,\\nbut I've found it be\\nbeneficial for my health.\\nAnd so some people do that,\\nand I've talked about before,\\nhow in double blind\\nplacebo controlled studies,\\npeople taking one to three\\ngrams of omega 3 fatty acids\\nper day, typically in the form\\nof a high quality fish oil,\\nalthough there are other sources as well,\\nalgae and so forth, can\\nexperience improvements in mood\\nthat are on par with some of the SSRIs,\\nthe selective serotonin\\nreuptake inhibitors.\\nAnd of course, if you're\\nprescribed an SSRI\\nby your psychiatrist or other\\ndoctor, please do take that\\nand don't cease to take it\\njust simply to take omega 3s.\\nHowever you might mention to\\nthem, and you can find links\\nto the studies in our previous\\nepisodes on depression\\nthat supplementation\\nwith omega 3 fatty acids\\nof at this one gram or\\nmore of EPA specifically,\\nso getting above that one gram threshold,\\nas high as three grams per day\\nof the EPA has allowed people\\nto take lower doses of SSRIs\\nand still keep their mood\\nin a place that's beneficial for them.\\nAnd in terms of keeping cortisol\\nin a range that's healthy\\nand doesn't bias someone toward\\nhigh levels of aggression\\nand irritability, that's\\nagain, going to be set\\nby a number of larger\\nmodulators or contextual cues.\\nAnd I've talked about some\\nof those on the podcast,\\nbut I'll just briefly recap them now,\\nobviously getting sunlight in\\nyour eyes early in the day,\\nand as much sunlight as\\nyou safely can in your eyes\\nthroughout the day is\\ngoing to be important.\\nAgain, because of this effect\\nof estrogen in long days,\\nnot increasing aggression,\\nhowever, in shorter days,\\nestrogen increases aggression\\nbecause of the increase\\nin cortisol observed in short days.\\nAnother way to reduce cortisol\\nwas discussed in our episode\\non heat and the use of sauna\\nand heat, but also hot baths.\\nIt turns out that hot baths and sauna\\ncan be very beneficial\\nfor reducing cortisol.\\nAll the details on that are\\nincluded in the episode on heat\\nand it's timestamped, so\\nyou can go directly to that\\nif you want to learn\\nabout the temperatures\\nand the various durations,\\nbut to just give\\na synopsis of that, a 20\\nminute sauna at anywhere\\nfrom 80 to a hundred degrees\\nCelsius is going to be\\nbeneficial for reducing cortisol.\\nIf you don't have access to a sauna,\\nyou could do a hot bath,\\nadjust the temperature\\nso you don't burn yourself.\\nI think 80 to a hundred degrees Celsius\\nis going to be too hot for many people\\nif it's a hot bath, whereas\\nmany people who can't tolerate\\nthat hot bath can tolerate the sauna.\\nSo safety first always, and of course,\\nbut hot baths reduce cortisol,\\nhot saunas, reduce cortisol\\nof a duration about 20 or 30\\nminutes is going to be beneficial.\\nAnd of course, some of you\\nmay be interested in exploring\\nthe supplementation route and\\nfor reductions in cortisol,\\nreally the chief player\\nthere is ashwagandha,\\nwhich is known to decrease\\ncortisol, fairly potently.\\nI should just warn you\\nthat if you're going to use\\nashwagandha in order to\\nreduce cortisol, first of all,\\ncheck with your doctor\\nor healthcare provider\\nbefore adding or subtracting anything\\nfrom your supplementation\\nor health regimen.\\nOf course, I don't just\\nsay that to protect us.\\nI say that to protect you,\\nyou are responsible for your health,\\nwhat you take and what you don't take.\\nChronic supplementation with\\nashwagandha can have some\\nnot so great effects of disruption\\nof other hormone pathways\\nand neurotransmitter pathways.\\nSo the limit seems to be\\nabout two weeks of regular use\\nbefore you'd want to take\\na break of about two weeks.\\nSo ashwagandha again, a very\\npotent inhibitor of cortisol,\\nbut with some other effects as well,\\ndon't use it chronically\\nfor longer than two weeks.\\nBut if your goal is to reduce cortisol,\\nlet's say you're going\\nthrough a period of increased\\nirritability and aggressive tendency,\\nmaybe you're also not\\ngetting as much light\\nas you would like, and\\nperhaps also, if there are\\nother circumstantial\\nthings leading you towards\\nmore aggressiveness and\\nyour goal is to reduce\\naggressiveness, that can\\nbe potentially helpful.\\nAnd in light of all this stuff\\nabout cortisol and estrogen\\nand day length, I should\\nmention that there are in fact,\\nsome people who have a\\ngenetic predisposition\\nto be more irritable and aggressive,\\nand there are a couple of\\ndifferent gene pathways\\nassociated with this.\\nWe never like to think about just one gene\\ncausing a specific behavior.\\nThe way to think about genes\\nis that genes generally code\\nfor things within our biology.\\nIn the context of today's\\ndiscussion, things like\\nneural circuits or the\\namounts of neurotransmitters\\nthat are made, or the amounts\\nof hormones that are made,\\nor the amount of neurotransmitter\\nhormone receptors\\nor enzymes, et cetera,\\nthat shift the activity\\nof our biology in a particular direction.\\nThey bias our biology.\\nAnd in fact, there is a\\ngenetic variant present\\nin certain people that adjusts\\ntheir estrogen receptor sensitivity,\\nand that estrogen receptor\\nsensitivity can result\\nin increased levels of aggression,\\nsometimes dramatic increases, however,\\nand also very interestingly, photo period,\\nmeaning day length, is a strong\\nmodulator of whether or not\\nthat aggressiveness turns up or not.\\nWhether or not that person with\\nthe particular gene variant\\nis more aggressive or not,\\ndepends on how long the day is\\nand how long the night is.\\nOne particular study that\\nI like that references this\\nis Trainer, et al, the\\ntitle of the study is\\n\\\"Photo period reverses\\nthe effects of estrogens\\non male aggression, via genomic\\nand non-genomic pathways.\\\"\\nThis was a paper published\\nin the proceedings\\nof the National Academy of Sciences.\\nWe'll put a reference to\\nthis in the show notes,\\nif you'd like to explore it further,\\nbut it really points to the\\nfact that rarely, sometimes,\\nbut rarely, is it the\\ncase that just one gene\\nwill cause somebody to\\nbe hyper aggressive.\\nAlmost always there's\\ngoing to be an interplay\\nbetween genetics and environment\\nand as environment changes\\nsuch as day length changes and\\nthe length of night changes,\\nso too, will the tendency for people\\nwith a given genetic variant\\nto be more aggressive or not.\\nNow, of course, in the absence\\nof detailed genetic testing\\nfor this particular\\nestrogen receptor variant,\\nmost people, I'm guessing\\nyou, are probably\\nnot walking around knowing\\nthat you have this gene or not.\\nRegardless, I think it's\\nimportant to pay attention\\nto how you feel at\\ndifferent times of year,\\ndepending on whether or not summer,\\nwhether or not it's winter,\\nwhether or not you're\\ngetting sufficient sunlight,\\nmeaning viewing sufficient\\nsunlight or not,\\nwhether or not you're getting\\nsufficient sunlight exposure\\nto your skin or not, whether or not\\nyou're indoors all the time.\\nGenerally those things\\ncorrelate with season,\\nbut not always.\\nYou can go through long bouts of hard work\\nin the summer months when days are long,\\nbut you're indoors a lot and\\ngetting a lot of fluorescent\\nlight exposure late in the evening.\\nAnd perhaps that's when you're\\nfeeling more aggressive.\\nSo we have to be careful\\nabout drawing a one-to-one\\nrelationship between\\nany biological feature\\nand certainly psychological\\nor behavioral feature\\nlike aggressiveness, but\\nit's, I believe, helpful\\nto know that these genetic biases exist,\\nhow they play out again,\\nthey shift our biology\\nin a general thematic direction.\\nThey don't change one thing.\\nThey change a variety of things\\nthat bias us toward or away\\nfrom certain psychological\\nand behavioral outcomes\\nand the various things that we can do\\nin order to offset them.\\nAnd we described those\\nearlier in terms of trying\\nto keep cortisol low by\\ngetting sufficient sunlight\\nregardless of time of year, and\\nregardless of whether or not\\nyou happen to have this\\nparticular genetic variant.\\nSo earlier I talked about\\nhow it is testosterone\\nconverted into estrogen\\nthat's activating aggression\\nin the ventromedial hypothalamus,\\nnot testosterone itself.\\nHowever, there are some\\nstudies carried out in humans\\nthat have evaluated the\\neffects of testosterone\\nand how levels of testosterone\\ncorrelate with aggressiveness\\nin the short term.\\nI'm just going to detail\\na few of those studies\\nbecause I think they are\\ninteresting and important.\\nFirst of all, there is a\\nstudy that has explored\\nlevels of testosterone in\\nmen of different professions.\\nNow, before I tell you the data,\\nI want to be very clear here,\\nwith a study such as this,\\none never knows whether or not these men\\nwent into a particular profession because\\nthey had a testosterone\\nlevel of a given value\\nor whether or not the work itself\\naltered their testosterone levels or both.\\nAnd I think it's fair to\\nassume that it's probably both.\\nSo be very careful in assuming\\nthat a given testosterone\\nlevel is causal for\\nchoosing a particular career\\nor that a particular career is causal\\nfor creating a particular\\ntestosterone level.\\nThis study used salivary\\ntestosterone levels\\nas the measure, which to\\nbe fair is not the best way\\nto measure testosterone.\\nTypically blood draw would be the best way\\nto measure testosterone,\\nbut nonetheless, provided\\nthe appropriate methods are\\nused, salivary testosterone\\ncan be a reasonable\\nmeasure of testosterone.\\nThe different occupations\\nthat were looked at were,\\nand here they just looked at\\nmen in this particular study\\nwere ministers, salesmen, they didn't say\\nwhat particular types\\nof salesmen, firemen,\\nprofessors, of all things,\\nphysicians and NFL players.\\nAnd what they discovered was\\nthat the testosterone levels\\nwere essentially in that\\norder from low to highest.\\nSo minister, salesman, fireman,\\nprofessor, physician, NFL player.\\nNow we could micro dissect\\nall the different stereotypes\\nand all the different features\\nof each of these jobs.\\nFor instance, we don't know\\nwhether or not the fact\\nthat the firemen happened,\\nat least in this study\\nto have lower testosterone\\nlevels on average\\nthan the professors or the physicians\\nwas because firemen have\\nlower testosterone levels\\nor because they have a\\nmuch more stressful job\\nand their cortisol levels\\nare higher than the professor\\nor the physician and cortisol\\nand testosterone, not always,\\nbut generally are in somewhat\\nantagonistic push-pull mode\\nbecause they derive from the\\nsame precursor, et cetera.\\nTypically, when cortisol is high,\\ntestosterone tends to\\nbe lower and vice versa.\\nSo we don't know what's\\ncausing these effects.\\nAnd again, this is just one\\nstudy and just six occupations,\\nbut I think it's relatively\\ninteresting given the fact\\nthat each of these professions\\ninvolves different levels\\nof competitiveness, right?\\nSo we don't necessarily\\njust want to think about\\nthe level of physical\\nexertion that's required,\\nbut also the level of\\ncompetitiveness because it's known\\nthat competitive interactions\\ncan cause increases\\nin testosterone, in\\nparticular, in the winners\\nof competitive interactions,\\na topic for a future podcast.\\nMeanwhile, studies that\\nhave analyzed also again,\\nsalivary testosterone in\\nprisoners, in this case,\\nfemale prisoners, so these\\nare incarcerated individuals,\\nhave looked at levels of testosterone\\naccording to whether or\\nnot the person committed\\na non-violent or a violent crime in order\\nto arrive in prison.\\nAnd higher levels of salivary\\ntestosterone were related\\nto those that had arrived in prison\\nbecause of conviction of a violent crime,\\nas opposed to a nonviolent crime.\\nLikewise, when they analyzed\\nprison rule violations,\\nso an indirect measure of\\naggressiveness, but in this case,\\nit was strongly associated\\nwith aggressiveness\\nbecause they knew what\\nthe violations were,\\nthey found were for\\nprisoners that had none,\\nno prison violations, prison\\nrule violations I should say,\\ntheir testosterone\\nlevels tended to be lower\\nthan the testosterone levels\\nof women that had some,\\neven one, or more aggressive\\nviolations of prison rules.\\nWe'll provide links to these\\nstudies in the show notes\\nif you'd like to go into them further,\\nobviously studies like\\nthis need to be taken\\nwith a grain of salt\\nbecause there are so many\\ndifferent factors, different\\nprisons have different degrees\\nof violence to begin with and\\ncompetitiveness to begin with.\\nBut just as a final pass\\nat examining the role\\nbetween testosterone and aggressiveness,\\nthere was a very interesting\\nstudy from Goetz, et al,\\nG-O-E-T-Z published in\\n2014, that looked at serum,\\nso in this case, blood\\nlevels of testosterone.\\n30 minutes after application\\nof a gel-based testosterone\\nthat goes transdermal\\nso that the testosterone\\ncan go very quickly into the bloodstream,\\nand then did brain imaging\\nto evaluate the activity\\nof neurons in the so-called\\ncorticomedial amygdala,\\nthe cortico, the medial\\namygdala is one of the areas\\nof the amygdala complex as we\\ncall it because it's complex,\\nit's got a lot of different nuclei,\\nyou know, know what nuclei\\nare, low clusters of neurons.\\nIt's got a lot of different\\nones, but that medial\\nand that cortico medial\\namygdala in particular,\\nis known to be associated with\\naggressive type behaviors.\\nIt's linked up with as part\\nof the larger circuit that\\nincludes the ventromedial\\nhypothalamus and other brain areas\\nthat we referred to\\nearlier, such as the PAG.\\nWhat is remarkable about this\\nstudy is that it showed that\\njust 30 minutes after\\napplication of this so-called\\nAndroGel, this testosterone that seeps\\ninto the bloodstream,\\nthere was a significant\\nincrease in of course, testosterone\\nand corticomedial amygdala activation.\\nSo testosterone can have acute effects,\\nimmediate effects on the\\npathways related to aggression.\\nAnd I think this is something\\nthat's not often discussed\\nbecause many of the\\neffects of steroid hormones\\nlike testosterone, and\\nestrogen are very slow acting.\\nIn fact, steroid hormones,\\nbecause they have a certain\\nbiochemical composition can actually pass\\nthrough the membranes of\\ncells, so the outside of a cell\\nand into the nucleus of the cell\\nand change gene expression in the cell,\\nyou think about puberty,\\nthe kid that goes home\\nfor the summer and then comes back\\nlooking completely different.\\nWell that's because of a\\nlot of genes got turned on\\nby steroid hormones like\\ntestosterone and estrogen,\\nbut the steroid hormones can also\\nhave very fast acting\\neffects and with testosterone\\nin particular, those can\\nbe remarkably fast acting\\nand one of the most apparent\\nand well documented fast acting\\neffects is this effect: the\\nability to activate cells within\\nthe amygdala, so you might say,\\n\\\"Well, I thought the amygdala\\nwas associated with fear?\\\"\\nWouldn't testosterone then cause fear? No.\\nTurns out that the amygdala\\nharbors, both cortisol,\\ncorticosteroid receptors\\nand testosterone receptors,\\nand they each adjust the activity\\nin the amygdala differently,\\nsuch that testosterone tends\\nto activate amygdala circuitry\\nfor inducing states of mind and body\\nthat are more action based\\nand indeed in animals\\nand in humans, testosterone\\napplication and activation\\nof this corticomedial amygdala pathway\\nwill make animals and\\nhumans lean into effort.\\nThis is why I say testosterone\\nmakes effort feel good,\\nor at least biases the organism\\ntoward leaning into challenge.\\nSo if you recall, there's not\\njust one type of aggression,\\nthere's reactive aggression,\\nwhich is triggered when one\\nis confronted with something\\nthat sometimes is inevitable, right?\\nOne needs to fight for their life\\nor for somebody else's life,\\nbut also proactive aggression\\nand proactive aggression\\ninvolves activation\\nof those go-pathways in the basal ganglia\\nand a leaning into effort to overcome\\nwhatever state one happens\\nto be in to begin with.\\nAnd so this is very important\\nbecause it points to the fact\\nthat yes, estrogen is\\nactivating aggression pathways\\nthat are in the ventromedial hypothalamus,\\nbut it's very likely the case\\nthat testosterone is acting\\nto accelerate or to bias\\nstates of mind and body\\ntoward those that will lead to aggression.\\nAgain, aggression is not\\nlike a switch, on and off.\\nIt's a process.\\nIt has a beginning, a middle and an end.\\nRemember that hydraulic pressure\\nthat Conrad Lorenz hypothesized?\\nWell, think of testosterone\\nas increasing the pressure\\ntoward an aggressive\\nepisode and then estrogen\\nactually triggering\\nthat aggressive episode\\nin the ventromedial hypothalamus.\\nSo if somebody tells\\nyou that testosterone,\\nendogenous or exogenous\\nmakes people aggressive,\\ntell them no, testosterone tends to make\\npeople lean into effort.\\nAnd if that effort\\ninvolves being aggressive,\\neither reactively aggressive\\nor proactively aggressive,\\nwell then it will indeed\\nlead to aggression.\\nBut the actual aggression\\nitself is triggered by estrogen,\\nnot testosterone.\\nNow, thus far, we really\\nhaven't talked too much\\nabout the social context\\nin which aggression occurs.\\nAnd that's because there\\nis a near infinite,\\nif not infinite number of variables\\nthat will determine that.\\nSo for instance, violent\\naggression is entirely appropriate\\nat a professional boxing match provided\\nit's occurring inside the ring and only\\nbetween the competitors\\nand within the bounds\\nof the rules of the sport, et cetera.\\nHowever, there are some\\nthings that tend to bias\\ncertain social context\\ntoward being more aggressive\\nor less aggressive and not\\nalways physical aggression.\\nAnd those generally come in two forms\\nthat many of you are familiar with,\\nwhich are alcohol and caffeine.\\nLet's discuss caffeine first.\\nWhy would caffeine increase\\naggressive impulsivity?\\nWell, the general effects of caffeine\\nare to increase autonomic arousal.\\nThe activity of the\\nso-called sympathetic arm\\nof the autonomic nervous system,\\nwhich is to put it very\\nmuch in plain language\\nit's the alertness arm\\nof your nervous system.\\nThat is, it creates a sense of readiness\\nin your brain and body and\\nit does so by activating\\nthe so-called sympathetic chain ganglia.\\nAgain, as I always remind people,\\nsimpa and sympathetic\\ndoes not mean sympathy.\\nSimpa means together, we're all at ones.\\nAnd caffeine tends to\\nbias our brain and body\\nto activate the sympathetic chain ganglia,\\nwhich run from about the base of your neck\\nuntil the top of your pelvis\\nand deploy a bunch of chemicals\\nthat jut out into the rest of your body,\\nactivate adrenaline release.\\nThere's a parallel increase in\\nof adrenaline in your brain,\\ncreating the state of\\nalertness and readiness.\\nThat state of alertness\\nand readiness can be\\nfor all sorts of things,\\nnot just aggression.\\nHowever when we are in\\na state of increased\\nsympathetic tone, meaning more alert,\\nsuch as after drinking caffeine,\\nwe will bias all those brain\\nand body systems, the hormones,\\nthe chemicals, et cetera that exist,\\ntoward action as opposed to inaction.\\nSo put simply, caffeine\\ncan increase impulsivity,\\nno surprise there.\\nOn the opposite end of things,\\nalcohol tends to decrease\\nactivity in the sympathetic\\narm of the autonomic\\nnervous system, tends to\\nmake us feel less alert.\\nNow, initially it can\\ncreate a state of alertness\\nbecause of its effects in\\ninhibiting the forebrain,\\nour forebrain prefrontal\\ncortex in particular\\nhas what's called top-down inhibition.\\nIt exerts a inhibitory\\nor a quieting effect\\non some of the circuits\\nof the hypothalamus,\\nsuch as the ventromedial hypothalamus.\\nThe way to conceptualize\\nthis is that your forebrain\\nis able to rationalize and think clearly\\nand to suppress behavior and\\nto engage the no-go pathways\\ntelling you, \\\"Don't say that mean thing.\\\"\\n\\\"Don't do that violent thing,\\\" et cetera.\\nAlcohol initially tends\\nto increase our level\\nof overall activity by\\nreducing inhibition,\\nnot just in that forebrain\\ncircuit, but in other circuits.\\nTends to make us more active.\\nWe tend to talk more\\nthan we normally would,\\nmove more than we normally would,\\nbut very shortly thereafter\\nstarts acting as a sedative\\nby way of reducing\\nactivity in the forebrain,\\nreleasing some of the\\ndeeper brain circuits\\nthat are involved in impulsivity,\\nbut also causing a\\nsomewhat sedative effect.\\nAnd then of course, as alcohol\\nlevels increase even further,\\npeople eventually will pass\\nout, blackout, et cetera.\\nSo what we've got with\\nalcohol and caffeine\\nis we've got two opposite\\nends of the spectrum,\\ncaffeine increasing arousal and readiness,\\nand the tendency for impulsivity\\nand alcohol also increasing\\nimpulsivity, but through\\na different mechanism.\\nA really interesting study,\\nand I should just mention\\nthat the title of the study is,\\n\\\"Caffeinated and\\nnon-caffeinated alcohol use\\nand indirect aggression at the\\nimpact of self-regulation.\\\"\\nSo the title is almost self-explanatory.\\nThis was a paper published\\nin the Journal of Addictive\\nBehavior in 2016, examining\\nhow ingestion of alcohol\\nthat's either caffeinated\\nor non-decaffeinated\\nalcohol drinks impacted what\\nthey call indirect aggression.\\nAnd just to remind you what\\nindirect aggression is,\\nthese are not physical acts of aggression.\\nThese are verbal acts of aggression,\\nso embarrassing others or otherwise,\\nsomehow trying to reduce\\nthe wellbeing of others\\nby saying certain things\\nin particular in groups,\\nthis study examined\\nboth males and females.\\nThis was done on by way\\nof a college campus study,\\nsubjects were 18 to 47 years old.\\nI guess there's some older\\nstudents on that campus,\\nor maybe they use some\\nnon-students, but you know,\\nthese days you've also got some students\\nthat are in their thirties and forties.\\nSo they have a fairly broad\\nswath of subjects included,\\nfairly broad racial\\nbackground as well, included,\\nnot at equal numbers, but\\nat least they included\\na pretty broad spectrum of people\\nwith different backgrounds.\\nThey looked in particular\\npeople that ingested\\nnon-caffeinated alcohol\\ndrinks at a frequency\\nof 9.18 drinks per week, okay.\\nAgain, there's a college campus,\\nnot that I encourage that.\\nI'm one of these people that I don't,\\nI've never really liked drugs or alcohol\\nand sort fortunate in that\\nway I can drink or not drink\\nand tend to not drink.\\nBut so to me, 9.18, drinks\\nper week sounds like a lot,\\nbut I know for some people\\nthat might actually be typical.\\nAnd then others who are drinking at least\\none caffeinated alcoholic\\nbeverage per week.\\nAnd those individuals end as high,\\nI should say as 7.87 caffeinated\\nalcohol beverages per week.\\nSo this would be energy drinks combined,\\ntypically with hard alcohol,\\nthat's fairly commonly\\navailable in bars and so forth.\\nAnd some individuals\\ndrank as much as goodness,\\n20.36 alcoholic drinks per week, total,\\nsome that were caffeinated,\\nsome that were not caffeinated.\\nThe basic outcome of this study was that\\nthe more alcohol someone\\ntended to consume,\\nthe more likely it was\\nthat they would engage\\nin these indirect\\naggressive type behaviors.\\nAnd in terms of the caffeinated\\nalcoholic beverages,\\nthere, the effect was\\nespecially interesting.\\nHere I'm just going to\\nparaphrase or I'll actually\\nread from the study, quote,\\n\\\"With regard to caffeinated\\nalcoholic beverage use,\\nour findings indicated\\nthat heavier caffeinated\\nalcohol beverage use\\nwas associated positively\\nwith indirect aggression,\\neven after considering\\none's typical alcohol use\\nand dispositional aggression.\\\"\\nWhat this means is that\\neven though alcohol\\ncan bias certain individuals\\nto be more aggressive,\\nand even though certain\\nindividuals already have\\na disposition toward\\nbeing more aggressive,\\nthere was an effect that was independent,\\nmeaning above and beyond both\\nalcohol and a predisposition,\\nmeaning if someone was consuming\\ncaffeinated alcoholic beverages, they had\\na particularly high likelihood of engaging\\nin indirect aggressive behavior.\\nNow this makes perfect\\nsense in light of the model\\nthey propose, which is\\nthis self-regulation model,\\nthat basically self-regulation\\ninvolves several things.\\nIt involves engaging in certain behaviors\\nand suppressing other behaviors.\\nSo as described before,\\nbecause alcohol tends to have\\na sedative suppressive\\neffect on the autonomic\\nnervous system, at least\\nafter the initial period,\\nit's going to tend to\\nreduce the likelihood\\nthat people will engage\\nin any type of behavior.\\nWhereas caffeine will\\nincrease autonomic arousal\\nand increase the likelihood\\nthat someone will engage\\nin a particular type of behavior,\\naggressive or otherwise.\\nSo the combination of caffeine\\nand alcohol is really acting\\nas a two prong system\\nto bias people towards\\nmore impulsivity that\\nis less self-regulation.\\nSo it's really yanking\\nyour volitional control,\\nyour ability to engage in\\nprefrontal top down inhibition\\nover your hypothalamus from two distinct\\nand specific circuits.\\nBy now, you should be\\ngetting the impression\\nthat self-regulation is a key feature\\nof whether or not\\nsomebody, maybe even you,\\nis going to engage in aggressive speech\\nor aggressive behavior.\\nAnd we've talked about a number\\nof tools that one can use\\nto reduce the probability\\nthat that will happen.\\nI suppose, if the\\ncontext were appropriate,\\nyou could even take those\\ntool recommendations\\nand just invert them and\\nincrease the likelihood\\nthat aggressiveness would happen.\\nBut regardless, self-regulation is key.\\nAnd in light of that, I want\\nto share with you a study\\nthat's focused on kids, but\\nthat has important ramifications\\nfor adults as well.\\nAs you probably are already\\naware there are many kids\\nout there that suffer from so-called\\nattention deficit\\nhyperactivity, disorder, ADHD.\\nThere are also many adults we are finding\\nthat are suffering from ADHD.\\nAnd there's also an epidemic\\nI would say of people\\nthat are concerned about\\nwhether or not they have ADHD.\\nNow whether or not they have true,\\nclinical ADHD or not, is not clear.\\nWe did an episode all about\\nADHD and tools for ADHD.\\nI would encourage you to\\ncheck out that episode\\nand some of the diagnostic criteria.\\nIf you have the opportunity you\\ncan find at hubermanlab.com,\\nas this study I'm about to\\nshare with you aptly points out,\\nthere is no objective\\ndiagnostic marker of ADHD.\\nThere's no biomarker or blood\\ndraw or blood test for ADHD,\\nwhether or not one has ADHD\\ndepends on their performance\\non a number of different cognitive tests\\nand behavioral tests and self report.\\nIn any event, the study\\nI'm about to share with you\\nexplored how a particular\\npattern of supplementation\\nin kids with ADHD was able\\nto reduce aggressive episodes\\nand impulsivity and\\nincreased self-regulation.\\nAnd the title of the study is,\\n\\\"Efficacy of carnitine in\\nthe treatment of children\\nwith attention deficit,\\nhyperactivity disorder.\\\"\\nEven though they put\\ncarnitine in the title,\\nthat what they focused\\non was whether or not\\nacetyl-L-carnitine\\nsupplementation could somehow\\nadjust the behavioral tendency\\nof these kids with ADHD\\nand to make a long story\\nshort, indeed it did.\\nThere was a very significant\\neffect of acetyl L-carnitine\\nsupplementation on improving\\nsome of the symptomology,\\nexcuse me, of ADHD.\\nA few details about this study\\nthat might be relevant to you.\\nThis was a randomized double\\nblind placebo controlled double\\ncrossover study, this was\\ndone as an outpatient study.\\nSo the kids weren't in a hospital,\\nthey were living out in the world.\\nThis again was done on younger kids.\\nSo this was six to six to 13 year old kids\\nthat were diagnosed with ADHD.\\nThey received either acetyl\\nL-carnitine or placebo,\\nand they did all the good practice stuff\\nthat good researchers do of making sure\\nthat the placebo and\\nthe acetyl L-carnitine\\nhad similar look and taste.\\nIt was consumed twice daily after meals.\\nI should just mentioned\\nthat acetyl L-carnitine\\ntypically is taken in\\ncapsule form or occasionally\\nan injectable form.\\nHere, they they were\\nusing this as a drink,\\nwhich essentially the\\nsame as capsule form,\\nbut the powders just\\ngoing directly into liquid\\nand the carnitine dosage was\\n100 milligrams per kilogram.\\nSo they're doing this\\naccording to the body weight\\nof these kids with a maximum\\ndosage of four grams per day,\\nthe quantity of the\\nmedication was supplied here.\\nI'm reading for a period of\\neight weeks and every eight\\nweeks a new quantity of\\nmedication was supplied.\\nSo basically this is a\\nfairly long term study,\\nexploring behavioral outcomes\\nand psychological outcomes\\nin week eight, 16 and 24.\\nThey also looked at blood\\nthings that you could only get\\nthrough a blood draw, so things\\nlike hemoglobin, hematocrit,\\nred blood cell count, white\\nblood cell count, et cetera,\\nthey, these are kids and\\neven if it were adults,\\nthey were quite appropriately examining\\na lot of the physiological measures\\nthat one would want to\\ncarry out to make sure,\\nfirst of all, that blood levels\\nof carnitine are increasing.\\nAnd indeed they confirmed\\nthat, but also that\\nno negative effects are\\nshowing up in the physiology\\nas well as the psychology of these kids.\\nSo, first I'll just tell you\\nthe basic outcome of the study,\\nwhich was, here I'm paraphrasing,\\n\\\"Here, given twice\\ndaily, carnitine appeared\\nto be effective and well tolerated\\ntreatment for a group\\nof children with ADHD.\\\"\\n\\\"They showed significant,\\nthe abnormal behavior\\ncompared to these other boys.\\\"\\nAnd now I'm moving to\\nthe table of results.\\nThey showed significant reductions\\nin their so-called \\\"Total Problem Score.\\\"\\nThe total problem score is\\na well-established measure\\nof behavioral problems in kids with ADHD.\\nAnd I should say adults with ADHD,\\nhas to do with challenges\\nin social and learning\\nenvironments and how well or poorly\\nan individual tends to perform.\\nReductions in intentional\\nproblems, overall reductions\\nin delinquency, and most important\\nfor sake of today's discussion,\\nsignificant reductions\\nin aggressive behavior.\\nNow what's especially nice\\nabout this study, I think,\\nis that even though it's\\na relatively small number\\nof subjects and certainly\\nneeds to be repeated\\nin other studies and other laboratories,\\nthat they were able to confirm\\nthe shifts in L-carnitine\\nwithin the bloodstream of these kids,\\nthat is they were able to\\ncorrelate the physiology\\nwith the psychological\\nchanges, in studies like this.\\nAnd frankly in all studies\\nof human pharmacology,\\nyou have to worry about\\neffects that show up,\\nnot just because of placebo effects,\\nbut because of so-called\\noff target effects\\nor related things, totally\\nindependent of the drug\\nor the particular\\nsupplement that you happen\\nto be looking at,\\nto put in the words of\\na great neuroscientist.\\nUnfortunately, he passed\\naway some years ago,\\nbut he was a member of\\nthe national academy,\\nextremely accomplished\\nneuroscientist once turned to me\\nand said, \\\"Never forget\\na drug is a substance\\nthat when injected into\\nan animal or a human being\\ncreates a paper,\\\" meaning you\\ncan see effects of pretty much\\nany drug or any supplement\\nin most all conditions.\\nHowever, it is in cases\\nsuch as this study,\\nwhere you can quite convincingly\\nsee that the particular\\nfeature of physiology that\\nyou expected to change,\\nactually changed.\\nAnd you see a psychological outcome\\nthat you can gain much greater\\nconfidence that the changes\\nin delinquency, in this\\ncase reduced delinquency,\\nimproved attention, reduced\\naggressiveness and so forth\\nwas at least somehow related to the shift\\nin blood physiology and\\nlevels of L-carnitine\\nor acetyl L-carnitine and\\ncarnitine in the bloodstream\\nof these children, as\\nopposed to something else\\nlike L-carnitine going and\\naffecting some downstream target\\nthat you have no knowledge of.\\nNow, of course that's\\nstill entirely possible,\\nbut I think studies such as\\nthese increase our confidence\\nthat things like L-carnitine can be used\\nperhaps in concert with things\\nlike omega 3 supplementation,\\ndiets that are biased towards\\nincreasing more tryptophan\\nand therefore more serotonin,\\nobviously avoiding things like alcohol\\nand as it appears from the\\nstudy I just described,\\nreducing one's intake or not consuming\\nany caffeinated alcoholic\\nbeverages seems like\\nit would be a good idea if your goal is\\nto reduce aggressiveness, to\\nthink about the hormone context\\nand whether or not you tend\\nto have higher testosterone,\\nan estrogen or lower\\ntestosterone, an estrogen,\\nmaybe even think about\\nthe work environment,\\nwhether or not you are\\nexisting in a particularly\\ncompetitive work environment\\nand even day life,\\ntime of year and whether or not\\nyou're getting sufficient\\nsunlight, whether or not\\nyou're avoiding light in\\nthe evening and so on.\\nSo studies such as this I think are useful\\nbecause they point to the fact\\nthat very seldom, if ever,\\nwill there be one supplement\\nor one nutritional change\\nor even one behavioral change,\\nthat's going to completely\\nshift in individual\\nfrom being aggressive and impulsive,\\nbut rather that by combining\\ndifferent behavioral regimens,\\nby paying attention to\\nthings like time of year\\nand work conditions and school conditions\\nand overall levels of\\nstress and likely therefore\\nlevels of cortisol, et cetera,\\nthat you can use behaviors,\\ndiet, and supplementation\\nas a way to shift that overall\\ninternal milieu from one\\nof providing a lot of\\ninternal hydraulic pressure\\nas it's been called throughout the episode\\ntoward aggressive impulsivity and relax\\nsome of that hydraulic pressure\\nand reduce aggressive tendencies.\\nSo once again, and frankly, as always,\\nwe've done a deep dive\\ninto the neurobiology\\nand the psychology of what I believe to be\\nan important feature of our\\nlives, in this case aggression.\\nI want to point out that in a episode\\nin the not too distant future,\\nI'm going to be hosting\\nDr. Professor David Anderson\\nfrom Caltech University,\\nwho is the world expert on the\\nneurobiology of aggression.\\nIn fact, he is the senior\\nauthor on many of the studies\\nrelated to the ventromedial hypothalamus\\nthat I discussed today.\\nOur discussion will touch\\non aggression, of course.\\nSo hearing today's episode will help you\\ndigest that information, but\\nwe are also going to talk\\nabout other emotional states.\\nHe is an expert, not just in aggression,\\nbut in motivated states related\\nto sex and mating behavior,\\nsocial relationships of all\\nkinds and how those relate,\\nnot just to biology and psychology,\\nbut also certain forms of pathology,\\nthings like PTSD and the\\nrelationship for instance,\\nbetween anger, fear,\\nanxiety, and depression,\\nand many other important\\ntopics that I know many of you,\\nif not all of you will be interested in.\\nIn the meantime, I want to point you\\nto his recently released\\nand wonderful book entitled,\\n\\\"The Nature of the Beast,\\nHow Emotions Guide Us.\\\"\\nAnd again, the author is\\nDavid Anderson from Caltech.\\nThis is a wonderful book.\\nIt serves as a tremendous introduction\\nto the history of the\\nstudy of these areas,\\nthe current science and\\ndiscoveries being made\\nin these areas, all made\\naccessible to the scientist\\nand non-scientist alike.\\nIt's a very engaging read and so much so\\nthat even though he was\\ngracious in sending me a copy,\\nI also purchased myself a\\ncopy to give to somebody\\nwho is a therapist, and\\nI've purchased another copy\\nto give to a high school kid that I mentor\\nbecause he's very interested\\nin the neuroscience of emotions.\\nAnd I think we are all\\ninterested in emotions,\\nnot just fear and some\\nof these negative states,\\nnot just aggression, but\\nalso the positive emotions\\nof our lives.\\nAnd so, \\\"The Nature of the\\nBeast, How Emotions Guide Us,\\\"\\nby David Anderson is a wonderful read.\\nI can't recommend it highly enough.\\nIf you're learning from and\\nor enjoying this

aren't\\nnecessary for everybody,\\nmany people derive\\ntremendous benefit from them,\\nfor things like improving\\nthe transition time\\nand the quality of your sleep\\nand improving alertness and focus.\\nAnd so on.\\nAnytime you're considering\\ntaking supplements,\\nthere are several key considerations.\\nFirst of all, those supplements should be\\nof the very highest quality.\\nAnd you want to make sure that\\nwhat's listed on the bottle\\nis actually what's in the bottle,\\nwhich is a problem for any\\nsupplement companies out there.\\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast\\nis pleased to announce\\nthat we are now partnered\\nwith Momentous supplements\\nbecause we believe\\nMomentous supplements to be\\nof the very highest quality\\nof any supplements out there.\\nAnd we've been working\\nvery closely with them\\nin order to direct them,\\nto create supplements\\nthat are individual ingredient supplements\\nof the particular quality and sources\\nthat we would like to see,\\nand that relate to the\\nscience and studies covered\\non the Huberman Lab Podcast.\\nIf you'd like to see some\\nof those supplements,\\nyou can go to livemomentous.com/huberman,\\nand there

              "'- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\\nwhere we discuss science\\nand science based tools\\nfor everyday life.\\n[Upbeat music]\\nI\\'m Andrew Huberman,\\nand I\\'m a Professor of\\nNeurobiology and Ophthalmology\\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\\nToday, we are going to\\ntalk about the biology,\\npsychology and utility of play.\\nPlay is something that\\nnormally we associate\\nwith children\\'s games\\nand indeed with being a child,\\nmuch of our childhood\\ndevelopment centers around play,\\nwhether or not it\\'s organized play\\nor spontaneous play,\\nbut as adults, we also need to play.\\nAnd today I\\'m going to talk about\\nwhat I like to refer to\\nas The Power of Play.\\nThe Power of Play,\\nresides in plays ability\\nto change our nervous system\\nfor the better,\\nso that we can perform many activities,\\nnot just play activities, better.\\nPlay can also function\\nas a way to explore new ways of being\\nin different scenarios in work,\\nin relationships, in settings of all kind,\\nand indeed also in the\\nrelationship to oneself.\\nIn fact,\\nwe are going to explore how\\nassuming different identities\\nduring the same game of play\\nor the same forms of play\\nhas been shown to be immensely powerful\\nfor allowing people\\nto engage in more creative thinking\\nand dynamic thinking and\\nindeed to better leaders\\nand more effective workers\\nand students and learners\\nand happier people.\\nI\\'m also going to cover\\nsome data that shows\\nthat learning to play properly\\ncan enhance one\\'s ability to focus\\nand is an active area of research\\nfor treatment of things like ADHD,\\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,\\njust as a little sneak preview\\nof where that\\'s headed,\\nchildren who do not access enough play\\nduring certain stages of childhood\\nare more prone to develop ADHD.\\nThe good news,\\nis all of us regardless of\\nwhether or not we have ADHD\\nor not,\\nwhether or not we had ample access to play\\nduring childhood or not,\\ncan engage and grow the neural circuits\\nthat allow for this\\nincredible power of play.\\nAnd this can be done again\\nat any stage of life today.\\nWe\\'re going to talk about the protocols,\\nthe science, we will review all of that.\\nAnd I promise you\\'ll come away\\nwith a lot of knowledge,\\nwhether or not you\\'re a parent,\\nwhether or not you\\'re a child,\\nwhether or not you\\'re a person of any age,\\nyou\\'re going to have tools\\nand knowledge that will benefit you.\\nBefore we begin,\\nI want to share with you\\nthe results of what I think\\nto be an extremely exciting\\nand certainly an actionable study\\nthat was just published in the\\njournal Scientific Reports.\\nThis is an excellent journal\\nNature Press journal,\\nPeer Reviewed, et cetera,\\nand the finding center around\\nwhat sorts of devices we\\nhappen to be reading on\\nand accessing information on\\nand how that\\'s impacting our physiology\\nand our capacity to learn.\\nOne of the more frequent questions I get\\nis what are all these\\ndevices, phones, tablets,\\ncomputers, video games et cetera,\\ndoing to our brains.\\nAnd finally,\\nthere\\'s some good Peer reviewed data\\nto look at that and to\\naddress it directly.\\nThis study, first author Honma\\nH O N M A\\nHonma et al,\\nis entitled\\n\"Reading on a smartphone\\naffects sigh generation.\\nThat\\'s SIGH sigh generation\\nbrain activity and comprehension.\"\\nAnd to just summarize what they found,\\nthey ran a study on 34 healthy individuals\\nand had them either read\\nmaterial on a smartphone\\nor on regular printed paper or a book.\\nAnd what they found is that\\ncomprehension on devices\\nin particular smartphones\\nis much poorer much worse than it is\\nwhen one reads on actual paper.\\nNow some of you may\\nexperience this yourselves.\\nNow they compared smartphones with paper.\\nAnd what they found was\\nthat when they looked\\nat people\\'s breathing,\\nthe normal patterns of breathing\\nthat people were engaging in\\ndid not differ between people\\nreading on a smartphone\\nor reading from paper.\\nHowever, one particular feature\\nof breathing did differ.\\nAnd that particular\\nfeature is what we call\\nphysiological sighs.\\nI\\'ve talked a lot about\\nphysiological sighs on this podcast,\\nand on social media,\\nwe had a terrific guest,\\nProfessor, Jack Feldman from\\nUniversity of California Los Angeles.\\nWho\\'s a world expert in\\nbreathing and respiration\\nand its impacts on the brain\\nand how brain controls\\nbreathing and respiration\\nand what you can learn from that episode.\\nOr I\\'ll just tell you again right now,\\nis that every five minutes or so,\\nwhether or not we are asleep or awake,\\nwe do what\\'s called a physiological sigh,\\nwhich is a big, deep inhale,\\noften a double inhale\\nfollowed by a long exhale.\\nIt goes something like this.\\n[Inhaling]\\n[Sighs]\\nNow you might think, oh,\\nI never breathe like that,\\nbut you do,\\nunless there\\'s something severely\\nwrong with your brain stem\\nevery five minutes or so\\nyou do one of these physiological sighs,\\nwhich reopens all the little\\nhundreds of millions of sacks\\nin your lungs called alveoli\\nthat bring in more oxygen\\nas a consequence of that\\nbig deep, double inhale.\\nAnd then you are able to\\nexhale carbon dioxide,\\noffload carbon dioxide\\nthrough that long exhale.\\nI\\'ve also encouraged people\\nto use the physiological sigh\\ndeliberately,\\nnot just spontaneously\\nas a way to reduce their stress quickly.\\nAnd indeed my lab works\\non physiological sighs\\nand it\\'s been exploring this\\nand they\\'re quite effective in reducing\\nour stress very fast.\\nReading on our smartphone,\\nseems to suppress physiological sigh.\\nPeople aren\\'t aware that it\\'s happening,\\nbut it\\'s happening.\\nSome people have talked\\nabout so-called email apnea,\\nwhich is the fact that\\npeople hold their breath\\nwhile they email or while they text.\\nAnd indeed many people do that.\\nThis is distinct from\\nemail or texting apnea.\\nWhat\\'s happening here is\\npeople are reading on the phone\\nand for whatever reason,\\nand I\\'ll talk about what\\nthe likely reason is,\\nbut for whatever reason,\\nthey\\'re suppressing their sighing\\nAnd as a consequence,\\nthe brain is not getting enough oxygen\\nand is not offloading\\nenough carbon dioxide.\\nAnd another finding in this study,\\nwas that the prefrontal cortex,\\nan area of the brain that\\'s\\ninvolved in focus and attention\\nand learning\\nbecomes hyperactive in a kind\\nof desperate attempt to focus.\\nAll of this can be summarized by saying,\\nif you happen to read on a device,\\nwhether or not it\\'s a tablet,\\na standard computer screen of any kind,\\nbut in particular on a smart phone,\\nregardless of how small or\\nlarge that smartphone screen is,\\nyou want to remind yourself\\nto engage in these physiological\\nsighs fairly regularly.\\nAnd it might even be better to just\\nread the most or at least the key issues\\nand things that you\\'re trying to learn\\nabout the key information from paper,\\neither books or printed out material\\nof some other sort.\\nWhat\\'s the underlying mechanism here?\\nWell,\\none of the reasons I\\nlike this study so much,\\nis that it brings together\\ntwo of my laboratories\\nand my particular\\ninterests in neuroscience,\\nwhich is how does our visual system\\nand the aperture meaning the\\nsize of our visual window\\nrelate to our so-called autonomic function\\nor our internal state.\\nAnd basically what\\'s happening here is\\nas any of us bring our visual\\nwindow in more narrowly\\nas we contract our visual window,\\nwhich is exactly what happens\\nwhen we\\'re looking at a little\\nsmartphone in front of us.\\nIt seems to suppress\\nthe breathing apparatus\\nbecause we know that physiological sighs\\nare controlled by a\\nspecific set of neurons\\nin the brain stem called\\nthe parafacial nucleus\\ndiscovered by Dr. Jack Feldman.\\nAnd so there must be a mechanism whereby\\nwhen we tighten our visual window,\\nwe somehow, and we don\\'t\\nknow yet how this happens,\\nbut somehow suppress the\\nactivity of these neurons\\nin the parafacial nucleus\\nthat generate this physiological sighs.\\nSo again,\\nyou have two choices or I\\nsuppose you have many choices,\\nbut two main choices\\nto contend with this new information.\\nOne is that you remind yourself\\nto engage in deep breathing\\nand in particular, physiological sighs\\nevery five minutes or so,\\nwhile reading anything or\\ntexting on your smartphone,\\nthe other would be,\\nagain, if there\\'s material\\nthat you really need to learn\\nfor sake of regurgitation later,\\nor for something particularly important,\\ntry and read that from\\neither a larger screen\\nor even better would be from\\nprinted materials or books.\\nAnother reason I bring all that up\\nis that it relates to a larger theme,\\nwhich is that I get many,\\nmany questions about ADHD\\nand about people\\'s challenges with focus\\nand much of what we\\'re\\ntold these days is that\\nwe are challenged with focus\\nbecause of the hundreds of videos\\nthat we can see streaming by\\nus in any moment on our phone,\\nwhich probably is true.\\nThe fact that the information\\nthat we\\'re reading\\non the internet and on our phones\\nis emotionally disturbing\\nor distressing in some way.\\nAnd that probably is true\\nas well in many cases.\\nThis study really points to\\nthe fact that independent\\nof the information that we are looking at\\nor consuming\\nindependent whether or\\nnot it\\'s movies or texts\\nor anything of that sort,\\nthe mere size of the window, the aperture,\\nthe screen that we are looking at\\nis also strongly impacting\\nour ability to learn\\nand remember information.\\nSo broaden that visual window\\nprint things out,\\nlook at a book.\\nI didn\\'t design the system.\\nI always say, you know,\\nhowever our visual system\\nand respiratory system\\nhappened to evolve.\\nI wasn\\'t consulted at the design phase.\\nThis is just simply how\\nyour brain circuits work.\\nSo if you want to learn things,\\nwiden that visual window and\\neven better print things out,\\npick up a book or read on a tablet even,\\nbut try and make that tablet larger\\nthan a smartphone screen size.\\nBefore we begin our discussion\\nabout The Power of Play,\\nI\\'d like to emphasize that this podcast\\nis separate from my teaching\\nand research roles at Stanford.\\nIt is however,\\npart of my desire and effort\\nto bring zero cost to consumer\\ninformation about science\\nand science related tools\\nto the general public\\nin keeping with that theme,\\nI\\'d like to thank the\\nsponsors of today\\'s podcast.\\nOur first sponsor is Athletic\\nGreens also now called AG1.\\nI started drinking Athletic\\nGreens way back in 2012.\\nAnd so I\\'m delighted that\\nthey\\'re sponsoring the podcast.\\nAthletic Greens is an all in one\\nvitamin mineral probiotic drink.\\nThe reason I started drinking it in 2012,\\nand the reason that I still\\ndrink it once or twice a day,\\nis that with Athletic Greens,\\nI cover all of my basic\\nfoundational vitamin mineral\\nprobiotic needs.\\nIt\\'s filled with adaptogens for recovery.\\nThe probiotics are particularly important\\nbecause they encourage health\\nof the so-called gut microbiome.\\nWe\\'re going to be talking a\\nlot about the gut microbiome\\non this podcast in the\\nweeks and months to come,\\nbut to make a long story short,\\nwe have a lot of bacteria\\nliving in our gut\\nthat are healthy bacteria\\nthat support them like\\ndigestion immune system,\\nmetabolic function, hormone systems.\\nAnd perhaps most interestingly to me,\\nthe gut microbiome\\nsupports brain function,\\nincluding mood cognition and so forth.\\nThe probiotics in Athletic Greens\\nstrongly support the gut microbiome\\nand thereby the other systems of the body,\\nincluding the gut brain access,\\nwhich I just referred to.\\nIf you like to try Athletic Greens again,\\nalso called AG1,\\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\\nto claim a special offer.\\nThey\\'re giving away five free travel packs\\nand a year supply of vitamin D3, K2,\\nvitamin D3 is extremely important\\nfor many biological functions.\\nWe are told that we can get\\nenough D3 from sun exposure,\\nbut many of us we\\'re getting sun exposure.\\nAnd many of us who are not\\ngetting enough sun exposure\\nstill don\\'t have ample\\nlevels of vitamin D3\\nSo supplementing with\\nvitamin D3 is necessary\\nfor many many people.\\nAnd K2 is important for\\ncardiovascular function\\nfor proper calcium balance, et cetera.\\nSo again, if you go to\\nathleticgreens.com/huberman,\\nyou can get the five free travel packs\\na year supply of vitamin the D3 K2,\\nand of course your Athletic Greens.\\nToday\\'s episode is also\\nbrought to us by ROKA.\\nROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses\\nthat are of the absolute highest quality.\\nI\\'ve spent a lifetime\\nworking on the visual system.\\nAnd one of the many challenges\\nthat your visual system\\nhas to deal with\\nis for instance, when you\\nmove from a bright environment\\nto a dimer environment, you have to adapt.\\nYou have have to be able\\nto see things clearly,\\nmany sunglasses and eyeglasses\\ndon\\'t allow that adaptation\\nto occur seamlessly,\\nROKA sunglasses and eyeglasses\\nallow that to occur in\\nconcert with your biology\\nand in a way that makes it very seamless.\\nYou just don\\'t notice\\nthe transition at all,\\nwhich is wonderful.\\nI love it \\'cause I don\\'t have\\nto constantly be taking off\\nand putting on my\\nsunglasses when I\\'m outside.\\nI happen to wear readers at\\nnight, eye glass readers.\\nIt\\'s also terrific as the luminance\\nin your environment changes.\\nSo they work under low luminance,\\nhigh luminance, et cetera.\\nThey\\'re very lightweight.\\nIn fact, you can wear them\\nwhen running, when cycling,\\nthey were designed by\\ntwo All-American swimmers\\nfrom Stanford.\\nAnd so originally they were designed\\nfor the purpose of being\\nworn during exercise,\\nbut you can wear them anywhere.\\nThey have a great aesthetic,\\nso you can wear them to dinner,\\nto work, et cetera.\\nAnd while a lot of performance\\neyeglasses out there,\\nin my opinion, make\\npeople look like cyborgs,\\nROKA sunglasses and eyeglasses\\nhave just a terrific aesthetic\\nthat you can wear truly anywhere.\\nIf you\\'d like to try ROKA glasses,\\nyou can go to roka.com that\\'s ROKA.com\\nand enter the code Huberman\\nto get 20% off your first order.\\nAgain, that\\'s ROKA ROKA.com\\nand enter the code Huberman\\nat checkout.\\nToday\\'s episode is also\\nbrought to us by Helix Sleep.\\nHelix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows\\nthat are second to none.\\nI started sleeping on a Helix\\nmattress about a year ago now,\\nand it\\'s the best sleep\\nthat I\\'ve ever had.\\nWhat\\'s unique about Helix mattresses\\nis that they tailor their\\nmattresses to your sleep needs.\\nSo if you go to their website,\\nyou can take a brief two minute quiz\\nthat asks questions like,\\ndo you sleep on your stomach\\nor your back or on your\\nside, maybe you don\\'t know,\\ndo you tend to run hot or\\ncold throughout the night?\\nOr maybe you don\\'t know,\\nand it matches you to the mattress.\\nthat\\'s perfect for your sleep needs.\\nI matched to the so-called Dusk mattress,\\nD U S K,\\nbecause I wanted a mattress\\nthat wasn\\'t too firm\\nand not too soft.\\nAnd so I sleep on a Dusk mattress.\\nYou should figure out what\\nmattress would be ideal for you.\\nIf you\\'re interested in\\nupgrading your mattress,\\nyou can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,\\ntake their two minute sleep quiz\\nand the match you to\\na customized mattress.\\nAnd you\\'ll get up to $200 off\\nany of your mattress orders\\nand two free pillows.\\nAgain, that\\'s $200 off\\nand two free pillows.\\nThe pillows are excellent.\\nI also use Helix pillows.\\nThey have a 10 year warranty.\\nYou get to try out the mattress\\nfor up to a hundred nights, risk free.\\nIf you don\\'t like it,\\nthey\\'ll come pick it up,\\ntake it away.\\nBut I think you\\'ll love it.\\nAgain if interested,\\nyou can go to helixsleep.com/huberman.\\nThere can get up to $200 off\\nand the two free pillows.\\nLet\\'s talk about play.\\nNow in researching this episode,\\nI thought that I was going to\\ncome across a bunch of papers\\nthat say this brain area\\nconnects to that brain area,\\nwhich controls play in animals.\\nAnd there\\'s similar areas\\nin babies and in adults.\\nAnd indeed, that\\'s true.\\nAnd we will talk about brain circuitry,\\nbut I think more\\nimportantly is to understand\\nwhat is the utility of play?\\nYou know, why do we\\nplay when we\\'re younger?\\nWhy do we tend to play\\nless as we get older?\\nAnd what in the world is play for?\\nSome of us would be\\ncategorized as more playful.\\nI\\'m sure that you know, people like this,\\nmaybe you are like this\\npeople that can walk into a room,\\na social setting of any kind,\\nand they seem to already\\nkind of have a playful,\\nmaybe even a mischievous\\nquality about them.\\nWe\\'ll talk about mischief\\na little bit later,\\nbut they sort of look at an environment\\nor a social setting as an opportunity\\nfor different kinds of novel interactions.\\nOther people and I\\'d probably\\nput myself into this category.\\nIf I walk into a novel environment,\\nI tend to be more in the\\nmode of just assessing\\nwhat that environment is like.\\nI\\'m not a particularly\\nspontaneously playful person,\\nalthough around certain individuals,\\nI might be more spontaneously playful.\\nWe are all on a continuum\\nof this kind of seriousness\\nto playful nature.\\nTurns out that all young animals,\\nincluding humans\\nhave more playfulness and tend to engage\\nin more spontaneous play\\nin their earlier years\\nthan in their later years.\\nAnd therein lies a very interesting portal\\nto understanding what the utility,\\nwhat the purpose of play is.\\nFirst of all,\\nI want to lay down a couple\\nof key facts about play\\nthat point to the fact that\\nplay is not just about games.\\nPlay is about much, much more\\nand play and in particular,\\nhow we played as a child\\nand still how we can play as adults\\nis really how we test\\nand expand our potential roles\\nin all kinds of interactions.\\nOne of the most important,\\ninteresting and surprising\\nfeatures of play\\nthat I\\'d like everyone to know about\\nis that it is homeostatically regulated.\\nSome of you are familiar\\nwith the term homeostasis.\\nHomeostasis is just this\\naspect of biological systems\\nto try and remain in balance.\\nYou know, if you stay awake\\nfor a long period of time,\\nyou tend to want to sleep\\nfor a long period of time.\\nIf you slept for a long period of time\\nand you\\'re very rested,\\nthen you tend to be very\\nenergetic the next day.\\nAnd of course, I know people\\nout there will immediately say,\\noh, well, if I sleep too long,\\nthen I\\'m groggy the next day.\\nOf course there are exceptions,\\nbut in general,\\nsleep and wakefulness are\\nin homeostatic balance.\\nThirst and water consumption\\nare in homeostatic balance.\\nIf you don\\'t drink any fluids for a while,\\nyou tend to get more thirsty,\\nyou drink fluids\\nand your thirst tends to diminish\\nlikewise with food.\\nLikewise, with most all\\nmotivated behaviors.\\nWell,\\none of the most important discoveries\\nof the last century,\\nwas largely the work of a\\nguy named Jaak Panksepp.\\nNo, it\\'s not Jack it\\'s Jaak Panksepp\\nwho really pioneered this understanding\\nof the biology of play\\nand relating that to\\nthe psychology of play\\nin animals and humans.\\nHe\\'s considered kind of\\nluminary in the field of play,\\nand what a great title to have, right?\\nIf you could have a title\\nand be a scientific luminary,\\nyou might as well be the, the play guy.\\nIn fact he was known and I\\'ll\\nget into this later as to why,\\nbut he was known as the \"Rat Tickler\"\\nbecause he tickled rats.\\nAnd he actually found that\\nrodents and animals of many kind\\ngenerate laughter in response to tickling.\\nAnd in fact,\\nthey don\\'t have the capacity\\nto tickle themselves\\nsomething we\\'ll also\\ntalk about why that is.\\nAnd he was called the \"Rat tickler,\"\\nbut then he discovered that\\nmany species of animals\\nengage in laughter in response to tickling\\nand they tickle each other.\\nAnd the reason you don\\'t\\nhear them laughing,\\nno you can\\'t hear your dog laughing\\nthat isn\\'t laughing it\\'s something else\\nis that most animals besides humans laugh\\nat kind of ultrasonic\\nlevels of auditory output.\\nMeaning the frequencies\\nof sound are just too high\\nfor you to hear,\\nbut with the appropriate devices,\\nhe was able with his colleagues\\nto isolate this so-called\\nthe \"Rat Laughter\"\\nand then turns out there\\'s kitten laughter\\nand there\\'s puppy laughter.\\nAnd of course there\\'s human laughter.\\nSo Jaak Panksepp was a very interesting\\nand pioneering person in this field.\\nAnd he also discovered that play\\nis homeostatically regulated.\\nMeaning if animals including children\\nare restricted from playing\\nfor a certain amount of time,\\nthey will play more when\\ngiven the opportunity\\nin the same way that\\nif I food restrict you\\nfor a long period of time,\\nyou\\'ll eat more when you\\nare finally allowed to eat.\\nNow this is important\\nbecause it moves this thing that we call\\nplay from the dimension\\nof higher order functions\\nor things evolved recently,\\nyou know, that are really\\nkind of at the front edge\\nof human evolution,\\ndeeper into the circuitry of the brain,\\nwhereby we say the brain stem,\\nthe kind of ancient parts of the brain\\nare going to be involved.\\nAnd in fact, that\\'s the case\\nas we\\'re going to learn\\nlater in the podcast,\\nplay is generated through the connectivity\\nof many brain areas.\\nBut one of the key brain areas\\nis an area called PAG Periaqueductal Gray.\\nThe Periaqueductal Gray\\nis a brain stem area.\\nSo it\\'s pretty far back\\nas the brain kind of transitions\\ninto the spinal cord.\\nAnd it\\'s rich with neurons\\nthat make endogenous opioids.\\nSo these are not the kinds of opioids\\nthat are causing the opioid crisis.\\nThese are neurons that you and I all have\\nthat release endogenous, meaning self-made\\nor biologically made opioids.\\nThey go by names like enkephalin\\nand things of that sort.\\nPlay evokes small amounts of\\nopioid release into the system.\\nThey kind of dope you up a little bit,\\nnot so much as one would see if\\none were to take exogenous opioids.\\nAnd in fact exogenous\\nopioids as we now know,\\nare potentially very hazardous,\\nhighly high addiction potential\\nhigh overdose potential.\\nThey cause all sorts of problems.\\nYes there are clinical uses for them,\\nbut they\\'re causing a\\nlot of problems nowadays,\\nbut these endogenous opioids\\nare released in children and adults\\nanytime we engage in play.\\nAnd that turns out to be a\\nvery important chemical state\\nbecause there\\'s something about\\nhaving an abundance of\\nthese endogenous opioids\\nreleased into the brain\\nthat allows other areas of the brain,\\nlike the prefrontal cortex,\\nthe area of the front that\\'s responsible\\nfor what we call executive function.\\nExecutive function is the\\nability to make predictions,\\nto assess contingencies.\\nLike if I do this,\\nthen that happens.\\nIf I do that, then that happens.\\nWell prefrontal cortex is often seen\\nas a kind of rigid executive\\nof the whole brain.\\nThat\\'s one way to view it,\\nbut probably a better way to view it\\nis that the prefrontal cortex works\\nin concert with these other\\nare more primitive circuitries.\\nAnd when the periaqueductal gray releases\\nthese endogenous opioids during play,\\nthe prefrontal cortex, doesn\\'t get stupid.\\nIt actually gets smarter.\\nIt develops the ability\\nto take on different roles\\nand explore different contingencies.\\nAnd we\\'re going to talk about role play\\nlater in different contexts.\\nAnd what we will find\\nis that so much of play\\nis really about exploring things in a way\\nthat feels safe enough to explore, right?\\nThis is not what happens\\nwhen we drive down the street\\nor when we bike down the street,\\nwhen we are headed to work,\\ncommuting on our bicycle\\nor walking or driving,\\nwe tend to be very linear\\nand we tend to be very goal directed.\\nWe\\'re not going to just take\\na new street just because\\nwe\\'re not going to be\\nspontaneously riding in the middle\\nof the road\\nand then on the sidewalk\\nand then back and forth.\\nAlthough I can remember as a kid,\\nI was doing some of that.\\nI like to jump off curb\\ncuts when I was a kid.\\nAnd then eventually I\\ngraduated, sorry to the cyclist,\\nbut I graduated to skateboarding.\\nAnd then I look on skateboarding.\\nYou\\'re always kind of exploring terrain,\\nbut you know, as I got older,\\nactually I find myself\\nbecoming much more linear.\\nI just don\\'t play with\\nmy commute very much.\\nIt\\'s really just about getting\\nto work and then working.\\nWhen endogenous opioids are in our system,\\nwhen we\\'re in this mode of play,\\nthe prefrontal cortex starts seeing\\nand exploring many more\\npossibilities of how we interact\\nwith our environment,\\nwith others and the roles that\\nwe can assume for ourselves.\\nAnd so we\\'re going to dissect one by one,\\nthe different aspects of play,\\nrole play, social play,\\nindividual play, imaginary\\nplay, competitive play\\nthey are enormous number\\nof dimensions of play.\\nAnd by the end of this episode,\\nwe are going to arrive\\nat a very key feature.\\nThe key feature is one that\\'s called\\nyour personal play identity.\\nAll of us have what we call\\na personal play identity.\\nThis personal play identity\\nwas laid down during development.\\nAnd it is the identity that you\\nassume in playful scenarios.\\nAnd it is identity that you\\nadopt in non playful scenarios.\\nNow the great news is that\\nyour personal play identity\\nis plastic throughout\\nyour entire lifespan.\\nYou can adjust your personal play identity\\nin ways that will benefit\\nyou in work in relationships\\nand your overall level of happiness.\\nWe will discuss protocols\\nand ways to do that.\\nBut I do want to give\\na nod to the late jack,\\nJaak excuse me,\\nJaak Panksepp, \"The rat tickler.\"\\nAnd I also want to just give\\na nod to play generally,\\nas we move forward in the discussion.\\nWhat I\\'d love for everyone to do\\nis to stop thinking about\\nplay as just a child activity,\\nnot just a sport related activity,\\nbut really as an exploration\\nin contingencies.\\nAgain, it\\'s an exploration of,\\nif I do A, what happens?\\nIf I do B, what happens?\\nIf someone else takes on\\nbehavior or attitude C\\nwhat am I going to do?\\nAnd play is really where\\nwe can expand our catalog\\nof potential outcomes,\\nand it can be enormously enriching.\\nAnd indeed as we\\'ll talk about\\nthe tinkerers of the world,\\nthe true creatives,\\nthe people that building\\nincredible technologies and art,\\nand also that just have incredibly rich,\\nemotional and intellectual\\nand social lives\\nall have a strong element of play.\\nAnd so today I hope to convince you\\nof some protocols that\\nwill allow you to expand\\nyour various roles in life,\\nthrough the portal of play.\\nSo we establish that play is homeostatic,\\nmeaning we all need to do it.\\nMany of us, including myself,\\nhaven\\'t played that much as adults.\\nWe\\'re all pretty busy.\\nNumber of us are stressed.\\nWe got a lot to do in life,\\nbut as children,\\nmost all of us engage in a lot of play.\\nAnd in looking at the way\\nthat very young children\\nand especially toddlers play,\\nwe can learn a lot\\nbecause it reveals the fundamental rules\\nby which the toddler brain\\ninteracts with the world.\\nNow,\\none of the key things\\nabout the baby brain\\nis that the baby brain somehow\\nknows that it can\\'t do\\neverything in the world, right?\\nIf a baby needs something,\\nit generally will cry or make\\nsome sort of vocalization\\nor some sort of facial expression\\nor combination of those.\\nAnd the caretaker, whoever\\nthat may be will provide it.\\nThis is an ancient hard wired mechanism\\nwhereby the so-called\\nautonomic nervous system\\nthat generates stress\\nwill create this kind of\\nwhining and discomfort,\\nmaybe arriving,\\nmaybe the baby gets\\nkind of red in the face\\nand the caretaker delivers some thing\\nbased on a good guess\\nof what that baby needs.\\nSo maybe it\\'s breast milk,\\nmaybe it\\'s bottle milk.\\nMaybe it\\'s a diaper change.\\nMaybe it\\'s to be warmed\\nup if the baby is cold,\\nmaybe it\\'s to be cooled\\ndown if the baby\\'s too warm,\\nmaybe if the baby\\'s in\\nits a little onesie thing,\\nit\\'s feeling restricted\\nand it just wants to move\\nand they\\'ll get taken out of their,\\ntheir crib or their stroller,\\nwhatever it is and allowed\\nto stretch out on the floor.\\nRemember the baby doesn\\'t\\nknow exactly what it needs.\\nIt only knows the state of discomfort.\\nAnd of course we don\\'t know\\nexactly what babies and toddlers\\nare thinking\\nbecause they can\\'t express\\nthemselves with language yet.\\nBut what\\'s key to understand\\nis the rule or the\\ncontingency that is set up\\nin that scenario.\\nIn that scenario,\\nthe child feels some discomfort\\nexpresses that discomfort verbally\\nor through a facial expression or both\\nand then some force some\\nperson from the outside world\\nresolves it.\\nAnd so the very young baby\\nand indeed many children\\nup to certain ages\\nand let\\'s confess many adults\\nare not able to meet or\\nadjust their internal states\\nof stress.\\nAnd so they look to\\nthings outside of them.\\nThat\\'s the first rule,\\nthe fundamental rule\\nthat we all learn when we come into life,\\nthat when in a state of discomfort\\nto look outside our immediate biology,\\nbeyond the confines of our\\nskin and find a solution,\\na sip of water for adults,\\nit might be sip of alcohol,\\nright?\\nProbably not the best\\ntool to relieve stress,\\nbut that\\'s one that many people do.\\nIn fact engaging for\\nthe baby that\\'s hungry.\\nThe bottle milk comes from the outside.\\nAs we gain more proficiency\\nin moving through life\\nand we can get things for ourselves.\\nWe still often bring things\\nfrom the external world in\\nto resolve this what I\\'m calling\\nautonomic discomfort or\\nautonomic dysregulation.\\nThat\\'s not a game, but that\\'s a rule.\\nAs we advance from infant to toddler,\\nwe start to think more\\nin terms of where we are\\nand what we own relative to\\nwhat\\'s out there in the world.\\nAnd now in the world of child psychology,\\nthere\\'s a somewhat famous poem\\nthat was written by a\\nresearch child psychologist.\\nHis name was Burton White,\\nand he wrote a poem called\\n\"The Toddlers Creed\"\\n\"The Toddlers Creed\" defines well,\\nwhat the rules and\\ncontingencies of play are\\nin very young children.\\nAnd it reveals to us just how narrow\\nand limited their world view is\\nand how self entered their world is.\\nSo \"The Toddlers Creed\" read quickly,\\ncuz\\' I don\\'t want to take up\\ntoo much time with this is.\\n\"If I want it.\\nIt\\'s mine.\\nIf I give it to you and\\nchange my mind later,\\nit\\'s mine.\"\\nFor anyone that\\'s played with a toddler,\\nyou can imagine this in your mind.\\n\"If I can take it away\\nfrom you, it\\'s mine.\\nIf I had a little while ago, it\\'s mine.\\nIf we are building something together,\\nall the pieces are mine.\\nIf it looks just like mine,\\nit\\'s mine.\\nIf it\\'s mine, it will never\\nbelong to anyone else,\\nno matter what.\"\\nAnd of course, as we hear this\\nsounds quite awful, right?\\nAnd yet this is actually\\na reflection of what\\na healthy toddler would\\nthink about the world.\\nThat the objects and things,\\nand even the people in\\nthe world are theirs,\\nthat they are actually\\npossessions that belong to them.\\nNow of course,\\nsome people never actually\\ntransition beyond this stage\\nof moral and social development.\\nAnd there are indeed some adults\\nthat fit \"The Toddlers Creed.\"\\nAnd you\\'re welcome to\\nshare this with them.\\nIf ever you think that\\nit might be of benefit\\nto their self-reflection.\\nBut in all seriousness Burton White\\'s\\n\"Toddlers Creed\" is really grounded\\nin this transition from\\nwhen we are infants.\\nAnd we have to have\\nthings delivered to us,\\nto the point where we are toddlers\\nand we can access things in the world,\\nbut we tend to assume\\nthat they are all ours.\\nAnd then the next stage\\nis the really key stage\\nas it relates to play\\nbecause is in the next\\nstage of development\\nis where young children start\\nto interact with other children\\nand there\\'s an exchange and a possession\\nand then a letting go of certain things,\\nlearning that not everything is yours\\nand that the entire world is not about you\\nis one of the key contingencies\\nthat is established during play.\\nIt\\'s one of the key way\\nin which children go\\nfrom being very self-centered\\nand basically unable to\\nengage with other kids\\nfor very long,\\nwithout some sort of eruption of crying\\nand some sort of battle of, you know,\\nkind of push pull over an object\\nto things like sharing and\\nthings like cooperative play.\\nSo as we transition from forms of play\\nthat are all about the self\\nthat are all me, me, me, me,\\n\"The Toddlers Creed\"\\nto forms of play that involve\\nsome discomfort in assuming roles\\nthat maybe we don\\'t want and\\nnot getting what we want.\\nIt\\'s really an opportunity for the brain\\nto start to explore different\\nroles that people take,\\nhow they work as individuals\\nand as pairs and in larger groups.\\nAnd to do that in a low\\nstakes environment, right?\\nYou wouldn\\'t want this to be worked out\\non the battlefield or\\nwhen searching for food\\nor in some high stakes environment\\nwhere the survival of the\\nspecies was important.\\nIt appears that these\\ncircuitry for play evolved.\\nSo that rules and contingencies\\naround who\\'s most important,\\nwhether or not the group is important,\\nwhether or not individuals\\nare going to be leaders\\nor followers, et cetera,\\nthat can be explored in\\na low stakes environment.\\nNow there are hundreds of\\ndifferent types of play\\nand hundreds of different\\ntypes of contingency testing.\\nBut the key theme here is that\\nplay allows children and\\nadults for that matter\\nto explore different outcomes\\nin a kind of low stakes environment.\\nIf you\\'re playing a board\\ngame or a card game,\\nyou might get really into that game,\\nbut unless there\\'s a lot of\\nmoney on the table, so to speak,\\nor you\\'re really playing\\nfor something important\\nor unless your ego is swollen\\nway out of proportion,\\nto reality,\\nif you lose, you might\\nnot feel good about it,\\nbut it\\'s truly not the end of the world.\\nAnd if you win,\\nyou might feel really good about it,\\nbut you\\'re not really incredible.\\nYou were just incredible in\\nthat particular situation\\nfor that particular moment,\\nit doesn\\'t really transform\\nthe rest of your life,\\nunless that game is of a\\nparticular type for sport\\nfor instance.\\nWe\\'ll talk about sport later.\\nSo the key theme here is that\\nplay is contingency testing.\\nplay is contingency\\ntesting under conditions\\nwhere the stakes are sufficiently low,\\nthat individuals should feel comfortable\\nassuming different roles,\\neven roles that they\\'re\\nnot entirely comfortable\\nwithin their outside life.\\nAnd that all relates again\\nto the release of these\\nendogenous opioids,\\nin this brain center periaqueductal gray\\nand the way that it allows\\nthe prefrontal cortex\\nin a very direct way I mean,\\ntruly it allows it in a biological way\\nto expand the number of\\noperations that it can run,\\nand start thinking about, oh, well, okay.\\nNormally I\\'m kind of a loner\\nand I like to read and work\\nand you know, hang out\\nalone maybe and play alone\\nbut you know okay,\\nI\\'ll play a board game\\nor a game of tennis\\nwhere I have a partner and\\nwe\\'re going to play as partners\\nagainst two other people.\\nOkay, that\\'s a little\\nuncomfortable, but I\\'ll do it.\\nAnd in doing that,\\nyou discover certain ways\\nin which you are\\nproficient in certain ways,\\nin which you are less proficient,\\nyou discover that the other person\\nactually tends to cheat a little bit\\nor the other person is\\nextremely rigid about the rules,\\nor maybe it is extremely rigid\\nabout the way they organize\\ntheir pieces on the board,\\nor they\\'re crossing the line\\ninto your side of the tennis court.\\nThere are all sorts of\\nthings that we learn\\nin these rather low stake scenarios.\\nThat\\'s the key theme here.\\nSo before I continue,\\nI just want to point to a\\ntool that anyone can use,\\nbut in particular, the\\nless playful of the group.\\nAnd I would put myself into this category.\\nAgain, I\\'m not somebody who really engages\\nin spontaneous play.\\nI enjoy sports.\\nI enjoy exercise,\\nbut that is distinct from play\\nbecause the sports and\\nexercise that I engage in,\\nI take pretty seriously.\\nThey\\'re not low stakes for me.\\nI put actually I put a\\nlot of importance on them.\\nWhich is I\\'m saying all this,\\nI probably should put a\\nlittle less importance on them\\nand have a little more fun with those.\\nAnd yet what I\\'m about to tell you is that\\nanyone and everyone can\\nbenefit from engaging\\nin a bit more of this playful mindset,\\nthe playful mindset is not necessarily\\nabout smiling and jumping\\naround or being silly.\\nThat\\'s not it at all.\\nIt\\'s not Tigger character\\nfrom \"Winnie the Pooh\" necessarily.\\nIt could be,\\nbut it\\'s really about allowing yourself\\nto expand the number of outcomes\\nthat you\\'re willing to entertain\\nand to think about how you relate\\nto those different outcomes.\\nSo what this means is putting yourself\\ninto scenarios where\\nyou might not be the top performer, right?\\nPlaying a game that you\\'re\\nnot really that good at.\\nI had this experience recently,\\nfriends that like to play cards,\\nthey like to do some low stake gambling.\\nThis is non illegal gambling ring.\\nThey play for trivial things.\\nAnd I generally don\\'t buy into the game.\\nI generally don\\'t play\\nmostly because they end\\nup winning and taking\\nwhatever it is that I have.\\nBut in the mode of assuming\\na more playful spirit,\\nthe idea would be well,\\nif the stakes are low enough,\\nthen to play simply for\\nthe sake of playing,\\nbecause there\\'s something to learn there\\nabout the other people in the group\\nand about one\\'s self\\nand how one reacts to things like\\nsomeone who\\'s clearly trying\\nto take everybody\\'s money\\nor somebody who is clearly trying to cheat\\nor somebody who\\'s clearly very, very rigid\\nabout every last detail,\\nincluding how the cards are\\ndealt and shuffled right?\\nThere is learning in this exploration.\\nAnd that is at a biological\\nlevel, the prefrontal Cortex,\\nstarting to entertain\\ndifferent possibilities,\\nstarting to entertain different outcomes\\nin this low stakes way.\\nAnd if you think about it,\\nthat\\'s not something\\nthat we allow ourselves\\nto do very often.\\nEven if we listen to new forms of music\\nor we go see new art or new movies,\\nthose are new experiences,\\nbut that\\'s not us making new predictions\\nabout what\\'s going to happen next.\\nIt\\'s not the brain working to figure out\\nnew possibilities.\\nAnd so you can immediately see how\\njust a small increase in your willingness\\nto put yourself into conditions\\nwhere you don\\'t understand\\nall the rules perhaps,\\nor you\\'re not super\\nproficient at something,\\nbut you enter it\\nbecause it is low stakes.\\nAnd because there is information to learn\\nabout yourself and others\\ncould start to open up these\\nprefrontal cortex circuits.\\nAnd when I say open up,\\nI don\\'t mean that literally\\nthere\\'s an opening\\nin your skull.\\nWhat I mean is that your prefrontal cortex\\ncan work in very rigid ways.\\nMeaning if A then B,\\nif I go down this street turn\\nleft and go that way to work,\\nit is fast.\\nIf I go down the other street, it\\'s slow.\\nIf there\\'s a traffic jam there,\\nI\\'m going to go there\\nbut it\\'s starting to explore\\ndifferent possibilities.\\nAnd there are very, very\\nfew opportunities in life\\nto explore contingencies\\nin this low stakes way,\\nsuch that it engages neuroplasticity,\\nthe prefrontal cortex.\\nSo play is powerful\\nat making your prefrontal\\ncortex more plastic,\\nmore able to change in\\nresponse to experience,\\nbut not just during the period of play,\\nbut in all scenarios,\\nbecause you get one prefrontal cortex,\\nyou don\\'t get a prefrontal\\ncortex just for play.\\nYou get a prefrontal cortex\\nthat engages in everything.\\nSo going forward,\\nI will layer on some more\\nconcrete aspects of tools,\\nbut for now,\\nif you\\'re somebody that\\ndoesn\\'t consider yourself,\\nparticularly playful\\nconsider,\\nand maybe even engage in\\njust a little bit of play\\nin some way,\\nthat is of discomfort to you\\nwith the understanding that is increasing\\nyour prefrontal cortical plasticity.\\nAnother really interesting\\nand important aspect of play\\nis so-called play postures.\\nThese are seen in animals,\\nand these are seen in humans.\\nAnd for those of you that\\nare watching this podcast\\non YouTube, I\\'ll do my\\nbest to adopt them here.\\nFor those of you that are listening,\\nyou\\'ll just have to imagine\\nthem in your mind\\'s eye,\\nbut Jaak Panksepp and\\nindeed Darwin himself,\\nstudy these play postures\\nthat all animal engage in.\\nPerhaps the most familiar one\\nis seen in dogs and in wolves\\nwhere they will lower\\ntheir head to the ground\\nand they\\'ll put their\\npaws out in front of them\\nand they will make eye contact\\nwith another typically dog or wolf\\nto so-called call the play.\\nNow, when they do this posture,\\nit\\'s obvious that they\\'re\\nlowering themselves.\\nThey\\'re not in an aggressive stance,\\nbecause they\\'re lowering their head.\\nAnd this is universally known\\namong canines as play posture.\\nThere\\'s some famous videos online.\\nYou can look these up\\nof dogs actually doing this with bears\\nthat they\\'re confronted with\\nand the bears, at least in these videos\\nin exchange also lowering their head,\\nand there you see bear\\ndog playful interactions.\\nNow you always have to be\\ncautious with bears in general.\\nI would say you have to\\nbe cautious with bears,\\nbut this speaks to the\\nuniversality of this bowing,\\nthis sort of the, the,\\nwhat some people call the puppy bow\\nor the play bow that dogs do\\nturns out that humans do this as well.\\nAlthough in a different form,\\nI\\'m sure there are some that go into the,\\nthe down-dog play posture,\\nbut more typically when\\nhumans want to play,\\nthey will do a subtle or\\nnot so subtle head tilt.\\nThe head tilt with eyes open\\nis considered the universal head\\nand facial expression\\nposture of play in humans.\\nSo when two people see one another,\\nif they are aggressive\\ntowards one another,\\nthey will assume certain facial\\nexpressions and postures.\\nBut if they\\'re feeling\\nplayful towards one another,\\noftentimes they\\'ll tip\\ntheir head to the side\\njust a little bit and\\nthey\\'ll open their eyes.\\nThey might even raise\\ntheir eyebrows briefly.\\nThis has been seen again\\nand again and again.\\nAnother hardwired feature\\nof so-called play postures\\nis what\\'s called soft eyes.\\nWhen animals are aggressive,\\nor when they\\'re sad,\\nthey tend to reduce the\\nsize of their eye openings\\nby basically making their\\neyelids closer together,\\nsomewhat,\\nby keeping their eyes together\\nin particular for aggression,\\nthey\\'ll bring their eyes towards\\nwhat we call a vergence eye movement.\\nBring it towards the center\\nthat actually narrows the\\naperture of the visual field.\\nWhen people or animals\\nwant to engage in play,\\nthey tend to open their eyelids somewhat,\\nand they tend to purse their\\nlips just a little bit.\\nSo it\\'s not like stronger\\npursing when your lips like this,\\nit\\'s, pursing their lips.\\nThey\\'ll open their eyes a little bit.\\nAnd they\\'ll often do\\nthe head tilt as well.\\nSometimes with a little bit of a smile.\\nThese are reflexive\\nthese are not trained up.\\nChildren do this.\\nAdults do this dogs, wolves do this.\\nEven certain birds will do this.\\nMost birds have eyes on\\nthe side of their heads,\\nbut they do a sort of form\\nof this soft eyes approach.\\nAnd certainly in raptors,\\nyou see a softening of the eyes\\nand indeed raptors like Hawks and Eagles\\nthey actually do have\\na certain form of play,\\nbut only early in life.\\nThe other thing that we see during play,\\nor what are called partial postures,\\npartial postures are a\\nkind of play enactment\\nof postures that would\\notherwise be threatening.\\nSo a partial posture that we\\nsee during play in animals\\nand humans that relates\\nto aggressive play.\\nSo things like wrestling\\nor things like rough and tumble play,\\nwhich is very common in animals\\nand kids and some adults.\\nIs that because there\\'s going\\nto be physical interaction\\nin animals,\\nwhat will happen is\\nthey will march toward one\\nanother often very slowly,\\nbut rather than having their hair up,\\nwhich is we call piloerection,\\nwhich is when the hair goes up,\\nanimals do this to make\\nthemselves look bigger.\\nThink of about the, the cat.\\nThat\\'s trying to look bigger or an animal\\nthat\\'s being aggressive,\\ntrying to look bigger\\nin the presence of a foe,\\na different animal that\\nthey\\'re either going to try\\nand kill or fight in some way,\\neven if it\\'s to defend themselves,\\npartial postures occur\\nwhen animals will approach\\none another,\\nbut they\\'ll keep their fur down.\\nHumans will do this to,\\nthey will approach during play,\\nbut unless it\\'s highly competitive play\\nlike a football game or a boxing match,\\nthey will actually shrink\\ntheir body size somewhat.\\nWe have hair on our bodies,\\nsome of us more than others,\\nand that hair is capable of piloerection.\\nIt can stand up.\\nThat\\'s the hair standing\\nup on end phenomenon,\\nbut most of us don\\'t have\\nenough hair on our bodies\\nthat we can actually use that\\nto make ourselves larger.\\nSo what you see with people\\nwho are about to engage in play\\nis they tend to make their\\nbody a little bit smaller\\nunless they are highly competitive\\nand highly competitive play\\nis its own distinct form of play.\\nThat we\\'ll talk about later,\\nsuch as during sport,\\nwhen the stakes are high,\\na Super Bowl football game,\\nI\\'m revealing my ignorance\\nabout sports here.\\nThe Super Bowl as it\\'s typically called\\nis a very high stakes game, right?\\nSalaries depend on it.\\nSponsorships depend on it.\\nIt\\'s on television,\\nreputations depend on it.\\nSo that\\'s not really playing a game.\\nThat\\'s playing a very high stakes game\\nand there you\\'re not going to\\nsee these partial postures.\\nYou\\'re not going to see soft\\neyes and tilting of the head.\\nAt least not between the\\nopposing players on the team,\\nyou\\'re going to see quite the opposite.\\nGrunting, screaming, shouldering\\npeople not blinking lowering their eyes,\\nor rather shrinking their eyes down to be,\\nto appear more aggressive.\\nThese kinds of things\\nstaring right through the other person,\\nyou know verbal threats et cetera.\\nSo that\\'s not really play,\\neven though we say they\\'re\\nplaying a game of football,\\nit\\'s very high stakes play.\\nWhat I\\'m referring to here\\nis when it\\'s fairly low stakes.\\nAnd we see this again\\nin animals and human.\\nSo there are many, many\\nof these partial postures.\\nAgain, they happen spontaneously.\\nSo if someone ever looks at you\\nand they tilt their head a little bit\\nand they raise their eyebrows\\nand they maybe smile a little bit,\\nthey\\'re looking at you playfully,\\nthat\\'s the universal human\\nexchange of, I want to play.\\nDo you want to play?\\nThere\\'s another play expression\\nthat is considered the\\nmost extreme of the come on\\nlet\\'s play express and postures.\\nAnd this is one that\\'s\\nseen in a lot of primates\\nand indeed in some humans as well.\\nAnd that\\'s the eyes wide open\\nand believe it or not tongue out,\\nit\\'s the, that kind of silly thing.\\nThat\\'s I don\\'t think that\\nI\\'ve ever done that before.\\nJust that kind of thing\\nis basically what primate\\nspecies of all kinds.\\nAnd indeed we are old\\nworld primates as well,\\ndo when they want to say,\\nI\\'m definitely here to play\\nand that\\'s why I\\'m here.\\nOkay it\\'s it has this kind\\nof silly look or connotation.\\nBut if you watch chimpanzees\\nor you look at Bonobos,\\nor even in the so-called\\nnew world monkeys,\\nwhich tend to be the smaller monkeys,\\nold world monkeys tend to\\nbe the ones that in general,\\nsee the world as we do,\\nthey have what we call trichromacy.\\nThey\\'re the ones that often\\ncan look very human-like.\\nThe new world monkeys\\ntend to be the little ones\\nin general I\\'ll give\\nyou a little trick here.\\nLittle tool based on primatology.\\nIf you see a monkey and it\\'s\\nmaking very slow movements,\\nor you see an ape of any kinds,\\nmaking very slow movements,\\nvery likely to be an old world primate.\\nIf you see a monkey\\nand it\\'s, it can very quick movements\\nlike it\\'s doing this kind of thing,\\nlike it\\'s like a could\\nbe a squirrel monkey\\ncould be a marmoset,\\nlikely to be a new world monkey.\\nAnd they don\\'t see the world\\nthat the same way we do,\\nthey see the world more like a dog.\\nThey don\\'t really see reds.\\nThey see reds as orange et cetera.\\nOkay that\\'s not a hard and fast rule.\\nAnd I\\'m sure the primatologists\\nare going to come after me\\nwith whatever primatologists\\ncome after you\\nwith monkey biscuits\\nor something like that.\\nBut in general, it\\'s a good rule.\\nIf you\\'re at the zoo and\\nyou see a slow moving monkey\\nwith slow deliberate gestures\\nkind of moves its eyes\\nmakes eye contact every once in a while,\\nthose tend to be the old world primates,\\nthose kind of jittery ones\\nthat look like they\\'re really\\nnervous wrapping their tail\\nand kind of hiding there\\nin a little bundle.\\nThose tend to be the\\nnew world monkeys, okay.\\nAgain, not a black and\\nwhite type division,\\nbut that\\'ll get you most of the way.\\nSo the whole purpose of\\nthese partial postures\\nor the tongue out thing\\nis to limit power in deliberate ways\\nto really take bodily expressions\\nthat could be portrayed or could be\\ninterpreted as aggressive\\nor as threatening or as wanting to mate,\\nor as willing wanting to do\\nanything for that matter.\\nAnd to limit the power with\\nwhich they are expressed\\nin very deliberate way.\\nSo that\\'s the putting the hair down,\\ndespite getting into a fighting stance.\\nThat\\'s saying let\\'s fight,\\nbut I\\'m not really here to fight fight.\\nIt\\'s low stakes fighting.\\nLike if I pin you,\\nthen I\\'ll let you go.\\nOr if you pin me, then\\nyou ought let me go.\\nAnd so immediately you can start to see\\nhow play starts to call into action,\\nsocial dynamics in which both parties\\nhave to make some sort of agreement\\nabout how high the stakes are.\\nNow, the failures to do this\\nare also very informative\\nin how we develop in social groups.\\nAnd this also can inform why some people\\nreally play well with others\\nand other people don\\'t.\\nAnd some people seem to\\nget along well with groups\\nand can handle other people.\\nAnd some people are very rigid.\\nIn fact, I have an anecdote\\nabout this when I was a kid,\\nwe used to play this game.\\nIt\\'s not a game I suggest,\\nbut we used to do what were\\ncalled \"Dirt Clod Wars.\"\\nSo a friend of mine,\\nhis parents were generally\\nnot home in the afternoon.\\nSo we must have been somewhere\\naround 10 or 11 years old.\\nAnd we would set up these\\ntwo big dirt mounds.\\nWe would shovel them to big\\ndirt mounds on two sides\\nof the yard.\\nAnd then we would just take dirt clods\\nand we throw them at one\\nanother and just have\\ndirt clod wars.\\nAgain, not suggesting this\\nI\\'m not responsible for what happens\\nif you do,\\nbut there were rules\\nand the rules were, for instance,\\nyou couldn\\'t pack rocks\\ninto the dirt clods\\nand you could run across to the other side\\nand you could jump on\\nthe other person\\'s mound\\nand you could throw dirt clods in there.\\nI guess, as the stuff that\\nwe thought was entertaining.\\nBut if someone got hit in the head,\\ngenerally there was an unspoken rule\\nthat you kind of stop\\nand see whether or not they were damaged\\nor not before you\\'d continue,\\nyou couldn\\'t continue pelting them.\\nAnd of course, people broke this rule.\\nIn fact I remember one kid\\nI\\'m not going to name him\\nbecause actually he\\'s grown\\ninto a very actually prominent\\nand functional adult,\\nbut he got hit once in the head.\\nAnd then I think someone\\nhad thrown a dirt clod\\nshortly thereafter,\\nand all of a sudden he\\njust went into a rage,\\npicking up rocks and sticks\\nand attacking another kid.\\nAnd so clearly that was a case in which\\nthe rules of the game\\nwere now being violated,\\nbut it served a very important purpose.\\nThere was, you know,\\nthe typical thing that the,\\nthere were some tears I think,\\nas I recall from one kid or the other,\\nthere was like snot coming out of the nose\\nand turning bright red, a kid went home.\\nIt was a mess.\\nThe parents had to say something,\\nor maybe there was a phone call.\\nI don\\'t quite recall how it got resolved.\\nBut the idea is that\\nthere\\'s an agreed upon set of rules\\nabout how high the stakes are\\nand what we\\'re all going to do.\\nAnd this is separate from sport\\nwhere there are clearly defined rules\\nabout what\\'s out of bounds.\\nWhat\\'s in-bounds.\\nWhat sorts of behaviors\\nwill get you a yellow card\\nor a red card for instance\\non the soccer field,\\nall animals including humans\\nare doing this low stakes\\ncontingency testing\\nand all animals including\\nhumans you\\'ll find,\\nstart to up the stakes.\\nAnd inevitably in group play,\\none member of the group\\nwill kind of break rules.\\nYou see this also in puppies.\\nSo for instance, puppies\\nwill bite one another\\nwith those sharp little\\nneedle-like puppy teeth.\\nI remember when Costello had those teeth,\\nthose things were so darn sharp\\nand puppies will yelp\\nwhen one of their littermates bites them,\\nthat Yelp actually serves a very important\\ninhibitory function.\\nThis is well defined\\nto tell the other one that\\'s too tough,\\nand this is how animals learn soft bite.\\nOkay.\\nIf they don\\'t get that feedback\\nfrom other littermates,\\nthey never actually learn.\\nWhat\\'s too hard and what\\'s soft.\\nAnd so humans do this as well.\\nNow you can look at your adult,\\ncounterparts,\\nand indeed we should probably\\nlook at ourselves and ask,\\nyou know did we learn\\nproper play contingency\\nwhen we were younger?\\nDo we tend to take things too seriously?\\nDo we tend to overreact aggressively\\nwhen other people are clearly engaging in,\\nyou know, playful, jabbing or sarcasm\\nor things of that sort.\\nSo each of you will have a\\ndifferent experience of this,\\nbut the point is that play\\nserves many functions,\\nit\\'s not just about the self.\\nIt\\'s also about interactions\\nbetween multiple people.\\nIt\\'s about rule testing\\nand low stakes contingency\\nrule breaking also\\nserves an important role\\nas is with the example\\nof the \"Dirt Clod War\"\\npuppies biting other puppies et cetera.\\nAnd last but not least,\\nthere are different forms of play\\nthat help us establish who\\nwe will become as adults.\\nOne of the more powerful of these\\nis role play when children\\nand sometimes adults\\nwill take on different\\nroles that are distinct\\nfrom their natural world roles\\nin order to for instance,\\nestablish hierarchies.\\nSo someone\\'s going to be the leader\\nand someone\\'s going to be the follower.\\nSomeone will be dominant.\\nSomeone will be submissive.\\nSomeone will work alone.\\nOther people will work in a group.\\nThese kinds of role playing\\nare again ways in which\\nthe prefrontal cortex\\nhas to expand the number of operations\\nin neuroscience we call these algorithms\\nthat it has to run in\\norder to make predictions.\\nYou have to take in a lot of information\\nabout your environment all the time\\nand make predictions.\\nBut if you are suddenly\\ncast into a new role,\\nwell then you definitely have to\\nmake even more predictions\\nfrom a different standpoint.\\nSo these are very powerful\\nfor teaching the brain,\\nhow to function.\\nI had a sister growing\\nup, I still have a sister,\\nfortunately,\\nand she and her friends\\nlargely played with dolls\\nand doll houses in the room next door.\\nAnd they take on different roles.\\nIn fact, some kids,\\nif they play alone\\nwill start to take on the role of leader\\nby taking on an imaginary or\\ncreating an imaginary friend.\\nAnd, you know, my apologies to my sibling,\\nbut for a long time,\\nshe had an imaginary friend\\neventually that imaginary\\nfriend disappeared.\\nI don\\'t know the science\\naround imaginary friends\\nand what it makes them disappear or not\\nat what stage of development,\\nbut imaginary friends are pretty common.\\nAnd that\\'s just another\\nway of being able to,\\nyou know boss somebody around,\\nif that\\'s your thing,\\nor to do engage in cooperative play.\\nSo we can look at this\\nstage of development,\\nwe call childhood\\nand we can look at each stage\\nof it and we can say, wow,\\nthere are all these\\ndifferent dimensions of play\\nthat really are about testing out\\nhow we feel comfortable or uncomfortable,\\nhow we react good or bad,\\nhow we react with stress or with glee\\nwhen others behave in certain ways.\\nAnd so what I\\'m hoping is coming through\\nis that play is not just about having fun.\\nPlay is about testing.\\nIt\\'s about experimenting\\nand it\\'s about expanding\\nyour brain\\'s capacity.\\nAnd that\\'s through early in development,\\nand it\\'s through throughout the lifespan.\\nSo at this point in the discussion,\\nI want to take a step back,\\nlook at the biology and\\nneurochemistry of play\\njust a little bit.\\nAnd that really define\\nwhat is effective play.\\nIf the goal of play is to\\nexplore different contingencies\\nin low stakes environments\\nand to expand the function\\nof our prefrontal cortex\\nso that we can see new possibilities\\nand new ways of being become\\nmore flexible, more creative,\\nmore effective outside\\nof the games of play\\nor the arenas of play, I should say.\\nWell then we should be asking,\\nhow do I know if I\\'m playing?\\nHow do I know if I\\'m playing correctly?\\nTurns out there\\'s an answer to that.\\nEarlier I referred to this brain area,\\nthe periaqueductal gray\\nthat releases opioids,\\nendogenous opioids into\\nour brain and body,\\nand tends to relax us a bit.\\nIt actually is what leads to\\nthese things like soft eyes\\nand head tilts and\\npuppies making, you know,\\npuppy postures and things of that sort,\\nand how that opens up the\\nnumber of different functions\\nor algorithms that the\\nprefrontal cortex can run,\\nbut there\\'s another piece of the puzzle,\\nwhich is for something to\\ngenuinely be play and playful,\\nand for it to have this\\neffect of expanding our brain\\nand engaging neuroplasticity\\nof really changing our brain\\nso that we can see and engaging\\nmore possible behaviors\\nand thoughts et cetera.\\nWe also have to have low\\namounts of adrenaline,\\nso called epinephrine\\nin our brain in body.\\nNow the background science\\nfor this is quite extensive,\\nbut for those of you that\\nare interested in papers\\nand manuscripts,\\nperhaps the best one is a review published\\nin Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews\\nby the very Jaak Panksepp\\nalthough he has a co-author,\\nwhich is Stephen Siviy,\\nS I V I Y\\nI\\'ll provide a link to this\\nin the caption show notes.\\nAnd the title of this paper is;\\n\"In Search of the\\nNeurobiological Substrates for\\nSocial Playfulness in Mammalian Brains.\"\\nAnd it\\'s a quite extensive review,\\nbut it basically boils down\\nto some key findings\\nwhereby, any sorts of drugs\\nor behaviors or scenarios\\nthat increase levels\\nof adrenaline too much,\\nwill tend to inhibit play\\nand drugs and scenarios\\nand I\\'m not suggesting\\nrecreational drugs here,\\nbut these were experiments that were done\\nin the laboratory setting\\nthat increase the endogenous opioid output\\nwill tend to increase playfulness.\\nAnd so really the state of mind\\nthat one needs to adopt when playing is,\\nfirst of all you have to\\nengage in the play it,\\nwhatever it happens to be\\nwith some degree of focus\\nand seriousness\\nand focus and seriousness in\\nthe neurobiological context\\ngenerally means epinephrine\\nbeing able to focus is largely reliant on\\nthings like adrenaline epinephrine,\\nbut also the presence of dopamine,\\nwhich is a molecule that\\ngenerates motivation\\nand focus in concert with epinephrine,\\nbut also that these endogenous\\nopioids be liberated.\\nAnd it\\'s really the low\\nstakes feature of play\\nthat allows those endogenous\\nopioids to be liberated.\\nWhat do I mean by that?\\nWell, if you are very, very\\nconcerned about the outcome,\\nlike you\\'ve put a lot of money\\non the table in a given game,\\nor you\\'re a football\\nplayer in the Super Bowl,\\nor you\\'re playing a game for which,\\nyou know, defeating the other person\\nor your team winning is\\nabsolutely crucial to you.\\nWell then that\\'s not\\nreally going to who engage\\nthe play circuitry.\\nOn the contrary,\\nif you are engaging in\\nthose same behaviors\\nor any other behavior in a way\\nthat you\\'re simply there to explore,\\nbut you don\\'t have high levels\\nof adrenaline in your system,\\nyou\\'re not stressed about\\nthe potential outcome.\\nWell, then that constitutes play.\\nNow that\\'s somewhat\\nobvious on the one hand\\nthat you take seriously\\nwhat you take seriously,\\nand you can be more playful about things\\nthat you don\\'t take so seriously,\\nbut what is absolutely not obvious\\nis that the state of playfulness\\nis actually what allows\\nyou to perform best\\nbecause the state of playfulness\\noffers you the opportunity to engage\\nin novel types of\\nbehaviors and interactions\\nthat you would not\\notherwise be able to access\\nif you are so focused\\non the outcome. Okay.\\nSo a state of playfulness\\nis absolutely critical,\\nnot just during play,\\nbut during competitive\\nscenarios of any kind.\\nI actually started to cultivate\\na practice related to this.\\nWhen I was in college,\\nI had this kind of general practice\\nof when I wanted to learn something.\\nI would tell myself that\\nit was the most important\\ninformation in the world\\nand that I was very very interested in it.\\nI would kind of lie to myself\\nand say oh, I\\'m super interested in,\\nI won\\'t name the topics,\\nbut super interested in this\\nor super interested in that.\\nAnd I could sort of delude\\nmyself into being hyper focused\\non whatever it is\\nthat I was learning\\nin ways that surprised me.\\nHowever,\\nwhen we are hyper focused on something\\nand we are rigidly\\nattached to the outcome,\\nwe can\\'t engage in flexible thinking.\\nSo it\\'s a great tool to be\\nhyper-focused on something\\nand take it very, very seriously\\nwhen we\\'re simply trying to learn things\\nby kind of rote memory,\\nlearn things and regurgitate,\\nlearn and regurgitate of the sort that,\\nyou know, I\\'m frankly a\\nlot of schooling involves.\\nBut if we are trying to\\nget better at something,\\nwe sort of hit a wall\\nin athletic performance\\nor in cognitive performance,\\nwhere we\\'re not creative enough,\\nwhere we\\'re finding\\nlet\\'s just use a sports example\\nthat, you know we only have\\na certain number of moves\\nthat we can deploy\\nor certain number of swings of the racket\\nthat we can deploy.\\nThe way to actually expand your practice\\nis to engage in this kind\\nof low stakes thinking,\\nthe idea that, well, I\\'m just\\ngoing to kind of play and tinker.\\nI\\'m going to explore in a way\\nthat it doesn\\'t really matter\\nif the ball goes back over\\nthe net,\\ndoesn\\'t really matter if\\nthe ball goes in the hole\\nand it\\'s counterintuitive\\nbecause you think,\\nno, the thing that we need\\nto do is drill and drill\\nand drill and drill.\\nAnd indeed there\\'s a place for that.\\nBut this mode of play with modest levels\\nof endogenous opioids being\\nreleased in our system,\\nplus low levels of adrenaline, right?\\nEpinephrine low levels of\\nepinephrine and adrenaline\\nare possible only when\\nthe stakes are low enough\\nthat we\\'re not stressed.\\nWell that combination really\\nallows the prefrontal cortex\\nto explore different possibilities\\nin ways that can truly expand\\nour capabilities over time.\\nNow, this has been seen again and again,\\nalso in the business sector,\\nsome of the more challenging,\\nor I should say compare additive\\ncompanies to get jobs at\\nare very interested in hiring people\\nthat as children were so called tinkerers,\\nand actually NASA was\\nfirst famous for this,\\nthat many of the people\\nthat achieved great success\\nin engineering at NASA,\\nwhen they looked back into\\ntheir childhood histories,\\nthose people tended to be tinkerers.\\nThey were people that would\\nkind of play with things\\nin way that wasn\\'t about\\nrigidly following a recipe\\nor an instruction manual.\\nGreat cooks discover new forms of food.\\nIndeed created entire genres of food\\nby way of being tinkerers.\\nOkay, musicians do this.\\nI grew up playing various sports,\\nbut skateboarding was one that\\nI was particularly involved\\nin for a long time.\\nOne of the greatest\\nskateboarders of all time\\nis some of you may recognize his name\\nas the Great Rodney Mullen.\\nAnd Rodney was kind of\\nfamous for evolving the sport\\nand continuing to evolve the sport in ways\\nthat no one could predict\\nusing skateboards and all sorts of ways\\nthat no one had thought of previously.\\nAnd of course there\\nare other skateboarders\\nthat did that as well,\\nbut he\\'s particularly well known for that.\\nAnd his process is his own.\\nI can\\'t speak to it too much,\\nbut he was also known\\nas a kind of a tinker\\nas somebody who would spend a lot of time,\\njust kind of flipping the board\\nand just flipping it into the air\\nand watching the ways in which it flipped\\nand kind of studying\\nthe physics of it really\\nand expanding on his\\nexisting understanding\\nof what could happen on a skateboard\\nby way of just playing.\\nNow, he took it very seriously,\\nbut it\\'s this kind of razor\\'s edge\\nbetween taking something very seriously,\\nbut also tinkering and\\nplaying and exploring\\nand just seeing what\\nhappens and kind of like,\\nwell, let\\'s just see what\\nhappens if we did this,\\nthat mindset is extremely powerful\\nto export from this\\nthing that we call play\\ninto what we could call\\nmore serious endeavor\\nof one\\'s occupation or sport,\\nwhether or not it\\'s behind a desk\\nor whether or not it\\'s\\nrunning around on a field\\nreally for or engineering, any endeavor.\\nAnd so the whole purpose\\nof this episode on play\\nis yes on the one hand\\nto illustrate the incredible\\nevolutionary utility of play\\nfor setting up the self\\nand relation of the self to others,\\nindeed for setting up cultures entirely,\\ncuz\\' cultures will watch sport together\\nor they\\'ll celebrate their team winning.\\nI mean, World Cup,\\nI\\'ve never been a big soccer fan,\\neven though my dad is\\nArgentine, but it\\'s incredible.\\nI mean the entire world kind of lights up\\nand gets engaged around\\nwhether or not their team,\\ntheir country is going\\nto win the Olympics also\\nbeing another example,\\nbut play and sport are not quite the same\\nas I\\'ve pointed out before.\\nAnd for all of us who\\nare thinking about tools\\nand things that we can\\nextract from science\\nto enrich our lives,\\nI would say for those of\\nyou that are already playing\\non a regular basis\\nin one form or another\\nterrific start to expand\\nother forms of play\\nin particular forms of play\\nthat involve new groups of individuals.\\nSo if you\\'re somebody that typically plays\\none-on-one with somebody,\\ntry to expand into playing as teams.\\nIf you\\'re somebody who only plays alone,\\nthen try to expand into playing in perhaps\\none-on-one first and in groups,\\nthis is the way that your brain learns\\nand evolves and changes and gets better.\\nAnd I raised this because\\nanother one of the top 10 questions I get\\nis how can I keep my brain young?\\nHow can I continue to learn?\\nHow can I get better in school\\nand sport in life and\\nrelationships, et cetera,\\nemotionally, cognitively,\\nand on and on and on.\\nAnd yes,\\nthere are supplements that\\ncan support neuroplasticity.\\nYes, there are brain games and apps\\nthat can support neuroplasticity.\\nBut if you really want to engage\\nneuroplasticity at any age,\\nwhat you need to do is\\nreturn to the same sorts\\nof practices and tools\\nthat your nervous system naturally used\\nthroughout development.\\nAnd it evolved over hundreds\\nof thousands of years\\nto trigger this thing that\\nwe call neuroplasticity.\\nAnd the reason this is\\nso important is because\\nit starts to move us away from\\nwhat some people call hacks.\\nI define hacks as using one\\nthing for a different purpose\\nto kind of get a shortcut.\\nI don\\'t really like the term, frankly,\\nand I don\\'t like it\\nbecause it\\'s not grounded\\nin any biological mechanism.\\nBut when we look at play,\\nwe can say, play is the portal to plastic.\\nPlay at every stage of life\\nis the way in which we learned the rules\\nfor that stage of life.\\nAnd play is the way in\\nwhich we were able to test\\nhow we might function in\\nthe real world context.\\nSo play is powerful.\\nAnd we could even say that play\\nis the most powerful portal\\nto plasticity.\\nThe reason for that is that\\nyes, this high opioid, low\\nepinephrine or adrenaline state\\nis what opens up play.\\nBut then inside of the arena of play,\\nwhen the prefrontal cortex is running\\nall these different possibilities\\nin this low stakes way.\\nBut with some degree of focus,\\nthere are a number of other\\nchemicals that are deployed.\\nThings like Brain-derived\\nneurotrophic factor\\nand other growth factors that actually\\ntrigger the rewiring of brain circuits\\nthat allow for it to expand.\\nAnd indeed that\\'s what is neuroplasticity.\\nIf you\\'re interested in those chemicals\\nand kind of arena of things that happen\\nwhen one engages in neuroplasticity,\\nthere\\'s a vast literature out there.\\nBut one of the more popular books\\nthat I think is quite good\\nis from my friend and\\ncolleague, John Ratey,\\nwho\\'s a psychiatrist at\\nHarvard Medical School.\\nThat\\'s R A T E Y.\\nHe wrote the book \"Spark\"\\na few years back,\\nand I think it\\'s still very relevant.\\nAnd John talks about\\nthe important role that play\\nexerts in the neuroplasticity process\\nand points to a number\\nof different protocols\\nthat one can engage in.\\nHe also points to the\\nimportance of navigating\\nnew environments\\nto not just go on the\\nsame hike every week,\\nor take the same walk,\\nbut actually get into\\nnew novel environments.\\nSo you\\'re starting to sense a theme here.\\nThere\\'s novelty,\\nexploring contingencies,\\nkeeping the stakes relatively low,\\net cetera, et cetera.\\nBut these really are the gates\\nto this holy grail that\\nwe call neuroplasticity.\\nNeuroplasticity as I\\'ve talked\\nabout in the podcast before\\nis a two step process.\\nIt involves focusing very intensely\\nor at least focusing\\nsomewhat on whatever it is\\nthat one is trying to learn,\\nand then engaging in deep rest,\\nideally deep sleep in\\nthe following nights.\\nAnd I\\'ve also talked about\\nthe benefits of things\\nlike naps and Yoga Nidra so-called NSDR,\\nNon Sleep Deep Rest\\nfor enhancing or accelerating plasticity.\\nYou can check out the episodes\\non Focus at hubermanlab.com\\nor the episodes on How to Learn Faster.\\nThe detail all of those.\\nWe had a newsletter that lists out\\nall the tools for neuroplasticity\\nenhancing neuroplasticity,\\nall that is available.\\nZero cost to you at\\nhubermalab.com, et cetera.\\nYou can just download that information,\\nbut John\\'s book that\\nnewsletter those episodes.\\nThey really point to this two step process\\nwhere it\\'s focus and then rest\\nfocus and then rest\\nand play is its own unique form\\nof focus and then rest, focus and rest.\\nIt\\'s not the same as learning\\nsomething for sake of school\\nor critically trying to\\nlearn a motor behavior\\nfor sake of sport.\\nIt\\'s really about expanding\\nthe number of things\\nthat you could learn down the line.\\nOkay, so said once again.\\nSo I just want to make\\nsure it\\'s abundantly clear\\nplay is about establishing\\na broader framework\\nwithin which you can learn new things.\\nIt\\'s not about learning\\nsome specific thing.\\nIt\\'s not about the game\\nyou happen to be playing.\\nIt\\'s not about the dollhouse\\nthat the kids are playing with\\nso that they can become\\namazing dollhouse players\\nwhen they grow up. Right.\\nThe dirt Clod war that\\nI referred to earlier\\nfor better or for worse\\nwas not about becoming\\nthe best dirt clod thrower\\nor winning the trophy for dirt clods\\nin the neighborhood.\\nAlthough we actually had a trophy\\nfor the best dirt clod team.\\nAlas, it was not my team that year.\\nBut the point is that\\nyou\\'re learning rules\\nand establishing a broader\\nfoundation of practices\\nthat then can learn more\\nthings within that context.\\nThus far I\\'ve tried to convince you\\nthrough a combination of data\\nand anecdote and explanation\\nthat adopting a stance of playfulness\\nand indeed engaging in play\\non a somewhat regular basis\\ncould be beneficial to you\\nregardless of circumstances or goals.\\nIf I haven\\'t done that already,\\nwhat I\\'m about to tell you,\\nhopefully will push you over the line.\\nIt turns out that when you\\nlook across the kingdom\\nof all animals,\\nwhat you find is that animals\\nthat engage in playful behaviors\\nfor the longest period of time\\nare also the animals that\\nhave the greatest degree\\nof neuroplasticity,\\nthe brain and nervous system\\'s ability\\nto change in response to experience,\\nput differently,\\nanimals that only play\\nfor a very small fraction\\nof their entire life\\nhave very rigid brains that\\ndon\\'t learn new things,\\nwhereas animals that\\nplay for a long period\\nthroughout their life\\nhave very plastic brains.\\nAnd there\\'s even some\\nevidence that\\'s at this point,\\nlargely anecdotal,\\nbut there\\'s some data starting to emerge\\nthat adults that maintain a playful stance\\nthat engage in things again\\nthat are low stakes contingency exploring\\nimportant enough that people focus\\nand that people pay attention\\nto what they\\'re doing,\\nbut that they are not, you know,\\nfilled with adrenaline, you know,\\nfreaked out about the\\noutcome being A or B,\\nthey\\'re not super, super competitive,\\nmaybe just a little bit competitive\\nor not competitive at all.\\nThat allows for more ongoing plasticity.\\nAnd one of the people that comes to mind\\nin thinking about this is\\nof course the Physicist,\\nand I should say the Great\\nPhysicist, Richard Feynman,\\nNobel Prize Winner Professor at Caltech\\nwas involved in the Manhattan Project,\\nbut was also known for being\\na lifelong tinker, right?\\nHe also is a mischievous tinker.\\nIf you read any of the books\\nabout Feynman or by Feynman\\n\"Surely You\\'re Joking.\"\\nMr. Feynman, or \"What Do You\\nCare What Other People Think?\"\\nthese are wonderful short stories,\\nmostly about Feynman,\\ndoing things like\\npicking all the locks at\\nthe Los Alamos Laboratory\\nand putting all the top secret documents\\nout on the floor of the office\\nso that when people\\ncame men in the morning,\\nthey were all out there.\\nObviously they weren\\'t\\nreleased to the general public.\\nHe didn\\'t want to threaten\\nnational security,\\nbut playing pranks like that.\\nAnd actually Caltech,\\nI don\\'t know if this is still the case,\\nbut Caltech where he was employed\\nwas always known for doing very\\ntechnologically challenging pranks.\\nThey\\'re not known for their\\nathletic pros at Caltech,\\nsorry, Caltech,\\nbut they were known for example,\\ndisrupting the scoreboard at\\nthe Rose Bowl in Pasadena,\\nfor instance,\\nand things of that sort\\nthrough technological\\nfeats, at least at the time\\nrequired a lot of playfulness\\nand technological pros.\\nSo if you look in science\\nor you look in art,\\nor you look in medicine\\nor you in any domain,\\nwhat you find is the people\\nthat continue to evolve\\nnew practices\\ntend to be people that were tinkerers.\\nPeople that are very creative,\\ntend to be people that are unafraid\\nof exploring things in\\na, this low stakes way.\\nThey\\'re not so rigidly\\nattached to the outcome\\nthat they have to do everything\\nperfectly all the time.\\nNow they might cloak\\nthese playful behaviors\\nso that their final works\\nalways look perfect or\\nalways look incredible,\\nbut they have this kind of\\nplayful nature about them.\\nI would venture even say that the,\\nthe street artist Banksy, for instance,\\nobviously an incredible\\nartist puts a ton of thought\\nand preparation into their work,\\nbut there\\'s a kind of playfulness\\nto the whole thing too,\\nof using two dimensional paintings\\nin concert with three\\ndimensional city dwellings\\nin ways that,\\nyou know I think that most\\npeople hadn\\'t previously,\\nthere were other people\\nlike Christo and, you know,\\nartists of that sort that did that.\\nBut I think Banksy is kind of recognized\\nas the modern, the modern rendition\\nof that kind of playfulness\\nusing cities in ways\\nthat most people don\\'t use cities\\nusing art in ways that\\nmost people don\\'t use art,\\nfor instance.\\nSo to go back to the example of Feynman.\\nFeynman was somebody who learned to paint\\nand draw quite well into his sixties.\\nHe was somewhat famous or infamous,\\nI should say for Bongo Drumming\\non the roof of Caltech.\\nI say infamous because\\nhe was known also for doing that naked.\\nSomething that certainly not in concert\\nwith the ethical standards and behaviors\\nof universities today.\\nBut Feynman had this\\nplayful spirit as a child.\\nHe had that playful spirit as a teenager,\\nand he had that playful\\nspirit as an adult.\\nAnd that\\'s one of the\\nwhole hallmarks of Feynman\\nwas that he wasn\\'t just a rigid physicist\\nwho could explain things\\nclearly to the general public.\\nHe always carried through\\nthis playful spirit\\nand in some of his writings,\\nhe pointed to the fact\\nthat that playful spirit\\nwas something that he worked very hard\\nto continue to cultivate in himself\\nbecause it was the way\\nin which he could see\\nthe world differently\\nand to indeed make great discoveries\\nin the field of physics,\\nbut also to kind of\\nevolve his relationship\\nto life more generally.\\nAnd so he comes to mind\\nas a prominent example\\nof somebody who did this.\\nAnd if I could achieve\\nanything with this episode,\\nbesides teaching you something\\nabout the biology of play,\\nit would be to teach you\\nabout the utility of play.\\nAgain, I\\'m,\\ndon\\'t consider myself a\\nparticularly playful person\\nby nature,\\nbut I\\'ve tried over the years to adopt\\nthis stance of exploring\\nthings that are, you know,\\nvery focused on contingencies\\nof different kinds,\\nbut keep the stakes low enough\\nthat I can have some fun doing them.\\nAnd I like to think that\\nit\\'s benefited me somewhat.\\nNow, I\\'d like to drill\\na little bit further\\ninto this thing that we\\ncalled neuroplasticity.\\nAgain neuroplasticity is the\\nbrain and nervous system\\'s\\nability to change in\\nresponse to experience.\\nAnd I should just say that\\nthroughout the entire lifespan,\\nthe nervous system can change very quickly\\nin response to negative experiences.\\nWe can almost all engage in\\nwhat\\'s called one trial learning\\nwhere if something really\\nterrible or traumatic happens\\nto us,\\nour nervous system will\\nrewire almost immediately,\\nat least within a few days,\\nsuch that we tend to want\\nto avoid the experience\\nthat led to that trauma.\\nNow the whole business of\\nwhy people return to things\\nthat are traumatic to them\\nis a whole other issue.\\nThere are books about\\nthings like trauma bonding.\\nThere\\'s the so-called\\nrepetition compulsion\\nfrom psychoanalysis\\nthat people go back into trauma to retest\\nand gain new opportunities\\nto overcome the trauma,\\net cetera, et cetera.\\nBut in general, what I\\'m\\nreferring to here is,\\nyou know,\\nyou have a bad experience\\nat the swimming pool\\nwhen you\\'re a kid\\nwhere someone holds your\\nhead underwater too long,\\nand then you just don\\'t want\\nto get back in the water.\\nThat\\'s one trial learning of sorts,\\nthat of course can be overcomed\\nthrough proper exposure therapy\\nor someone that you\\ntrust taking you there,\\nor any number of behaviors\\nthat allow you to overcome that,\\nbe that particular scenario\\nand experience something new\\nin that same context.\\nBut across the lifespan,\\nthe learn earning of new\\nthings, new contingencies,\\nnew possibilities\\noccurs very differently\\nfrom about age zero when we\\'re born\\nuntil about age 25 and thereafter.\\nSo from about, about,\\nI want to emphasize\\napproximately age 25 onward\\nneuroplasticity occurs through the process\\nthat is exactly as I\\ndescribed before, focus, rest,\\nfocus, rest, we focus very intensely.\\nWe can\\'t do the thing.\\nWe can\\'t do the new movement.\\nWe can\\'t do the golf swing.\\nWe can\\'t learn the math.\\nWe try, we try, we try, we\\ntry, we sleep a few nights.\\nAnd then all of a sudden\\nwe can do it, right,\\nbecause the rewiring actually\\noccurs during deep rest\\nor naps,\\nbut mostly during deep sleep.\\nFrom birth till about out age 25 however,\\nwe can learn things, new things,\\nand new contingencies,\\nnot just negative things\\nand traumatic things\\nthrough somewhat passive\\nexposure to those things, right.\\nI will never forget the first time\\nthat we went on a family\\ntrip to Washington DC.\\nAnd we went to the Smithsonian.\\nI got to see the, the old fighter planes.\\nAnd I think,\\nI think the Kitty Hawk\\nor the first one of the\\nfirst planes was there.\\nAnyway, I obviously my\\nrecollection isn\\'t terrific.\\nMy hippocampus is, is\\nflailing on that one,\\nbut I\\'ll never forget the trip.\\nAnd I\\'ll never forget who went.\\nAnd I think I was probably\\neight or nine years old.\\nIt\\'s embedded somewhere in my memory.\\nAnd so just through passive experience\\nand my focusing on the\\nthings that excited me\\nabout that trip,\\nI have a recollection of that experience.\\nI didn\\'t have to deliberately focus.\\nI didn\\'t, wasn\\'t telling myself focused,\\nyou\\'re going to need to\\nremember this trip someday\\nand you\\'re going to be\\npodcasting about this,\\nyou know, in 39 years, or whenever\\nagain, I forget exactly how old I was.\\nBut the key feature here is that\\nthe developing brain is able\\nto learn through passive experience\\nbecause the neurons, the nerve\\ncells in the developing brain\\nare much more over-connected\\nthan they will be later in life.\\nThe way to think about this is sort of,\\nif you use Google maps,\\nas I do too often I think\\nwhen I drive,\\nthere are a number of roads and pathways\\nthat would get you from\\npoint A to point B.\\nWe could imagine those as neural circuits,\\nor we could imagine neural\\ncircuits as those roads.\\nEarly in development,\\nthe nerve connections\\nare much more extensive.\\nIt it\\'s like having a Google maps\\nthat where everything is\\nconnected to everything\\nthrough tiny little cross streets.\\nAnd the whole thing is\\njust a complete mess.\\nBut then by taking particular routes\\nof behavior of thought of emotion,\\ncertain routes become well established.\\nAnd the other routes that are not taken\\nsimply disappear.\\nNow in the biological\\ncontext in the brain,\\nwe call that process pruning.\\nAnd the simple way to envision\\nthis is early in development.\\nYou have many, many more\\nneurons than you will have\\nas an adult.\\nThose neurons are\\nextensively interconnected,\\nand approximately 40% of\\nthose interconnections\\nwill disappear by the\\ntime you\\'re 25 years old,\\nthey are gone.\\nThey are actively\\nremoved through processes\\nthat involve things like\\nglial cells that come in\\nand literally sneak their little processes\\nin between neurons at the synapse,\\nwhich are the points of\\ncontact and communication\\nbetween neurons and push those apart,\\neven eat neurons, right?\\nThere\\'s some incredible\\nwork from for instance,\\nBeth Stevens\\' Lab at\\nHarvard Medical School,\\nshowing that glial cells\\ngo in and eat synapses\\nthat are not functional for\\nthat particular circuit.\\nNow, what this tells us is\\nthat much of our learning\\nduring development is the\\nremoval of incorrect connections,\\nbut it also involves the\\nstrengthening of connections\\nthat are going to serve certain\\nemotions, certain functions,\\nmotor functions, cognitive\\nfunctions, et cetera.\\nThe process of play\\nis largely a process of engaging pruning\\nof neural connections\\nand strengthening of the\\nremaining connections.\\nI\\'m sure that many of\\nyou have heard the term\\nfire together wire together.\\nThat phrase is often\\nincorrectly attributed\\nto the great Donald Hebb,\\nwho indeed was great.\\nDid incredible work a\\npsychologist from Canada\\nwho established a lot of the\\nbasic cellar learning rules\\nfor learning and memory,\\nbut it was the also great Dr. Carla Shatz,\\nwho is now at Stanford\\nand was at Berkeley and Harvard as well,\\nbut who is at Stanford Medical School\\nwho coined this term fire\\ntogether wire together.\\nIndeed that\\'s what happens\\nwhen children play\\nwhen adolescents play\\nand when young adults play,\\nwhether or not it\\'s social play\\nor play with an object,\\nwhether or not it\\'s a\\nsport or a play of any kind\\nimaginary play imaginary friend play,\\nthere is a strengthening of\\ncertain neural connections\\nand a pruning away of up to 40%,\\nperhaps even more of connections\\nthat are not necessary for\\ncertain types of behaviors,\\nemotions, and thoughts.\\nAnd what this means is\\nthat it is through the process of play,\\nthat we become who we are as adults.\\nAnd as I mentioned earlier,\\nit is through the process of play\\nthat we are able to adjust\\nwho we are as adults.\\nNow, there are bounds on this process,\\nas far as I know there\\'s\\nnever been a reported case\\nof an individual who had a hyperplastic\\nor I should say a brain that\\nwas as plastic in adulthood\\nas it was in childhood.\\nBut what this tells us is that\\nwhat we do in the process\\nof play as children\\nis really how we set up the rules\\nfor how we behave as adults\\nin almost all domains,\\nwhich is really incredible.\\nAnd of course the reassuring thing is that\\nplaying as an adult\\nwill allow you to expand\\non those neural circuits.\\nYou can literally grow new connections.\\nSome of you may be saying,\\ndoes it create new neurons\\nfor better or for worse?\\nIt does not seem that\\nmany new neurons are added\\nto your brain in adulthood.\\nThere are some papers\\nthat report a few neurons\\nin certain brain areas,\\nisolated brain areas,\\nbut by and large,\\nmost of the rewiring of neural connections\\nis the removal of certain connections.\\nThis process we\\'re calling Pruning\\nand the strengthening of\\nthe remaining connections\\nthat make those kind of Google maps roads.\\nAnd the analogy I laid out before\\nthicker and more robust think about as\\ntaking little trails\\nand turning them into roads,\\nthen paving those roads.\\nThen turning those roads into highways,\\nthen putting up more\\nlanes on those highways\\nand eliminating all the small\\nlittle back-country roads\\nthat one could take.\\nAnd again,\\nthis is an analogy for what is happening\\nat the level of neuro circuitry.\\nNow,\\none of the key findings that\\nhas emerged from the literature\\nis children that have\\nbeen subjected to trauma\\nor immense amounts of stress of any kind,\\nhave a harder time both engaging in play,\\nbut also a harder time\\naccessing neuroplasticity later\\nin life.\\nThe good news is this is\\nnot a permanent effect.\\nAnd we\\'ll talk about some\\nof the ways to overcome that\\nin a moment,\\nbut this should make sense to you\\nbecause earlier we talked about\\nhow a high level of adrenaline\\nepinephrine in the brain and body\\nactually inhibits blocks the circuits\\nin the brain and body that\\ngenerate play behavior.\\nAnd when I say that,\\nI mean that in a very concrete way,\\nthat epinephrine and adrenaline\\ncan actually suppress\\nthe sorts of circuitry\\nthat can lead to things like soft eyes\\nor tongue out, or the head tilt,\\nor what we called partial postures\\nof being able to engage in,\\nyou know, a rough and tumble play,\\nbut not take that to the\\npoint of outright aggression\\nand damaging the other\\nperson or them damaging you.\\nSo when I say that,\\nyou know, trauma and stress\\ncan inhibit neuroplasticity\\nby way of inhibiting play\\nat a deeper neuro biological level.\\nWhat I\\'m really saying is\\nthat the high levels of adrenaline\\nthat are generated from\\ntrauma and stress actually\\nshut down the circuits\\nthat allow a child or a young adult\\nto enter the game of play\\nor in the game of play\\nin the same way that\\na child or young adult\\nwho didn\\'t have high levels of adrenaline\\nin their system could possibly engage in.\\nNow,\\nthe good news is that many of\\nthe existing trauma therapies\\nthat are out there now,\\nincluding things like EMDR\\nExposure Therapy, Cognitive\\nBehavioral therapy,\\nand on and on,\\nincluding some of the therapies\\nthat are more neurochemical,\\nthings like ketamine, or\\nare more engineering based,\\nthings like Transcranial magnetic\\nstimulation for instance,\\nmany of those are paired\\nwith forms of talk therapy\\nthat are really about the\\nsame thing that play is about,\\nwhich is exploring\\ndifferent contingencies.\\nIt\\'s about exploring different types\\nof emotional experiences\\nas they relate to the\\nsame sort of scenario\\nthat created the trauma.\\nAnd we did an entire\\nepisode on fear and trauma,\\nand I recommend you\\ncheck out that episode.\\nIt\\'s easy to find again\\nat hubermanlab.com,\\nit\\'s on YouTube, Apples,\\nSpotify, et cetera, et cetera,\\nvery easy to find.\\nAnd there I talk all\\nabout trauma treatments\\nand the various kinds of trauma treatments\\nthat are out there,\\ntheir efficacy in different\\nscenarios and traumas and so on.\\nBut the point I\\'d like to make now is that\\nthe reason why children who\\nexperience a lot of trauma\\nand stress have limited\\nplasticity later on\\nis because the neurochemical substrates\\nthat are created from trauma and stress,\\nbecause after all\\nstress is epinephrine and\\nepinephrine is stress.\\nThose are inseparable\\nand the way in which it\\nmore or less shuts down\\nor at least inhibits suppresses\\nthose play circuits.\\nAnd again the reassuring thing\\nis that by engaging in play as adults,\\nwe can reactivate some of those circuits\\nand reopen the plasticity.\\nIn fact one very prominent\\ntrauma treatment now,\\nespecially for people\\nthat have been subjected\\nto very severe traumas,\\nin the ongoing sense,\\nmeaning traumas that went\\non for many, many years\\nis to get them to engage in play\\nin things like dance\\nin basically getting them to engage\\ntheir bodily movements\\nin ways that they would otherwise\\nnot feel comfortable to engage in.\\nAnd I find this area so interesting\\nbecause on the face of it, you could say,\\noh, that\\'s kind of, you know,\\nis that really biomedical treatment?\\nYou know, you\\'re taking\\npeople who traumatized\\nand having them dance.\\nI mean, it seems kind of\\nsilly on the one hand,\\ndepending on your, you know,\\nyour particular orientation.\\nBut on the other hand,\\nit\\'s actually quite\\nprofound and quite grounded\\nin the mechanisms by which\\nthe brain circuits change.\\nSo again,\\nback to this original principle,\\nwhich is that play, isn\\'t\\njust one portal to plasticity\\nplay is the fundamental\\nportal to plasticity\\nand that play and dance\\nand exploration of novel movements,\\nexploration of novel athletic movements\\nare the route\\nby which we access new ways of thinking\\nnew contingencies.\\nAnd I find it wonderful\\nthat the trauma release\\nand the psychiatric and\\npsychology community\\nare exploring things like play and dance\\nand other forms of\\nreopening these circuits\\nbecause indeed we would all love\\nfor there to be a magic pill\\nby which trauma could be erased\\nand new memories could be laid down\\nor a device that could do that.\\nBut frankly, if you ask me\\nor a number of my colleagues,\\nwhether or not that\\'s likely\\nto happen anytime soon\\nin an effective way,\\nI think the short answer\\nis going to be no,\\nthat there are going to be chemicals\\nand things that can augment\\nand support that process,\\nbut that there\\'s not going\\nto be just a magic pill\\nthat will suddenly\\nreverse trauma altogether.\\nThat it\\'s always going\\nto be a case whereby\\nshifts in neurochemical states\\nare going to have to be combined\\nwith new ways of thinking\\nand new behaviors.\\nAnd I find it wonderful in reassuring\\nthat people are looking\\nat play and play behavior\\nas a not just one tiny\\nshard of possibility there,\\nbut that it might actually\\nbe the main driver\\nand a highly productive lever\\nby which to rewire the traumatized brain.\\nSo if you\\'re like me,\\nyou might be thinking,\\nokay, I\\'m willing to be more playful.\\nI\\'m willing to explore,\\nplay as a portal to plasticity.\\nAnd that all makes good sense,\\nbut what should I play?\\nWhat should I do?\\nWell, we\\'ve already established\\nthat you want to keep\\nyour adrenaline low.\\nYou have to keep the stakes slow enough\\nthat you\\'re not going to get\\ntotally consumed by the outcome.\\nNow, for some people who\\nare highly competitive,\\nthat\\'s going to be challenging.\\nAnd yet I don\\'t want to make it seem\\nas if you can\\'t be\\ncompetitive during play.\\nThere are many forms of competitive play\\nthat because you are a competitive person,\\nallow you to drive great joy\\nfrom that competitive play.\\nI have a friend who\\'s\\nparticularly good at horseshoes.\\nI\\'m not particularly good at horseshoes,\\nbut whenever we play horseshoes,\\nI can tell he\\'s out there\\nto crush me on horseshoes.\\nAnd it\\'s just one of these\\nthings where, you know,\\nI can tell he derives great pleasure\\nfrom crushing me at a game of horseshoes.\\nI can\\'t say because I\\nhaven\\'t actually done\\nthe microdialysis,\\nwhich is a way of extracting chemistry\\nfrom the brain in real time,\\nnor have I recorded from his\\nbrain or image it in a scanner,\\nwhether or not he has\\nhigh levels of epinephrine\\nor low levels of epinephrine.\\nDuring those games of horseshoes,\\nI suspect his low levels of epinephrine\\nand high levels of dopamine,\\nespecially when he wins.\\nAnd he has, he wins every time.\\nBut the win is that you can\\nbe competitive during play,\\nprovided that you were enjoying yourself.\\nOkay, you can be competitive\\nprovided that you were enjoying yourself.\\nThere are particular forms of play\\nthat lend themselves\\nbest to neuroplasticity.\\nAnd those particular forms of play again,\\nare not designed to\\nnecessarily just engage\\nthe plasticity that allows\\nyou to perform that behavior,\\nbut rather to expand the\\nnumber of possibilities\\nfor your brain to change\\nin general throughout life\\nand the two major forms of those\\nfor which there\\'s good\\nPeer Reviewed Research\\nis to engage in novel forms of movement,\\nincluding different speeds of movement.\\nSo let\\'s say for instance,\\nyou\\'re somebody who runs.\\nI happen to like running.\\nI try and run three times a week.\\nAnd generally when I run, I run forward,\\nI don\\'t run backward, although recently,\\nbecause I\\'ve become very excited\\nabout the work of so-called\\n\"Knees Over Toes Guy,\"\\nhis name is Ben Parker,\\nbut he goes by \"Knees Over\\nToes Guy\" on Instagram.\\nI\\'ve never met him,\\nbut we\\'ve exchanged a few\\nmessages back and forth.\\nAnd some of his practices involve\\nwalking backwards or doing\\nsled poles backwards.\\nI found these to be very beneficial\\nfor my back and for my,\\nyou know, interior tibialis\\nand some things that have really helped\\nwith my posture and so forth.\\nBut in general, when I run, I run forward,\\nI don\\'t tend to run backward that much.\\nAnd I might do that for\\na few minutes at the end,\\nbut not so much throughout the entire run.\\nRunning doesn\\'t lend itself\\nto a lot of novel forms\\nof movement, lateral movements.\\nSo for the nerds out there\\nmovement in the Sagittal plane\\nor angled movements,\\nbut it does appear that\\nthings like dance or sports\\nwhere you end up generating\\na lot of dynamic movements\\nwhere there\\'s jumping,\\nwhere there\\'s movement\\nat different angles,\\nwhere there\\'s ducking,\\nwhere there\\'s leaping,\\nthat basically involve a\\nlot of dynamic movement.\\nAnd aren\\'t just strictly linear.\\nThose seem to open the\\nportals for plasticity.\\nAnd that\\'s because they mimic\\na lot of the brain circuitry\\nthat is associated with play.\\nAnd the reason for that\\nis the way in which\\nthose dynamic movements\\nand movements of different speeds\\nengage the vestibular system.\\nThe balance system,\\nthe vestibular system is in the inner ear,\\nrelates to the cerebellum,\\nwhich translates the mini brain.\\nYou got a little mini brain\\nin the back of your brain.\\nIt brings together visual\\ninformation in a very direct way.\\nI talked a lot about this in the episode\\non how to learn faster.\\nSo if you want to go in\\ndepth on how vestibular\\nand different types of motor\\nmovements can open plasticity,\\nI talk a little bit more, I\\nshould say a lot more there,\\nbut suffice to say that engaging in play\\nthat has a lot of dynamic movement\\nor movements of different speeds,\\nthings like dance,\\nthings like sports,\\nlike soccer where you\\'re\\nmoving in different dimensions.\\nThat tends to be very conducive\\nto what we would call\\nplay related circuitry\\nprovided you don\\'t take it too seriously.\\nYou don\\'t get those high\\nlevels of epinephrine.\\nNow for those of you that\\nare also interested in non-physical\\nor non-athletic forms of play\\nthat can really expand plasticity.\\nThere\\'s some very interesting research\\nabout the game of Chess.\\nI don\\'t play the game of Chess.\\nI\\'ve played a few times.\\nI confess I don\\'t know how\\nto move all the pieces.\\nSo I\\'m not going to try\\nand describe that here,\\nbut I\\'ve always wanted to learn Chess.\\nAnd I think after reading some\\nof the Peer Reviewed Research\\nabout chess and play and neuroplasticity,\\nnow I understand why\\nthere\\'s a really nice paper\\npublished in the International\\nJournal of Research\\nin Education and Science in 2017.\\nAnd the title of this paper is,\\n\"Is Chess Just a Game or Is It a Mirror\\nThat Reflects a Child\\'s Inner World?\"\\nThat\\'s a very, a very intense title\\nfor a biologist like me,\\nbut this paper is so interesting\\nbecause what it really points to is\\nthe fact that in a single game chess,\\nyou have at least as I\\nunderstand two players,\\nand those two players are moving\\npieces on the chess board,\\nfor which each piece can\\ndo different things, right?\\nCan move in different ways\\nunder different scenarios,\\nbut they\\'re different\\nrules for different pieces.\\nAnd so each player actually has to assume\\nmultiple identities during the same game.\\nAnd each of those identities\\nhas different rules\\nand ways of interacting.\\nSo in a way we can think\\nof chess as one game,\\nbut actually chess is\\na kind of a substrate\\nfor exploring multiple roles\\nfor different characters.\\nAnd this is quite a bit different\\nthan for instance, video games\\nwhere somebody has their\\nfavorite video game player,\\nor they have an avatar.\\nAnd they\\'re always in the same role.\\nIt\\'s also quite a bit different\\nfor when you engage in any kind of play\\nwhere you are yourself,\\nyou\\'re just being you in that game.\\nAnd so now I\\'m highly\\nincentivized to explore chess.\\nYou see quotes out there, for instance,\\nthings like \"Chess is life\\nor jiu jitsu is life.\"\\nI always assumed that that\\nmeant that someone\\'s entire life\\nwas chess\\nor their entire life was\\njiu jitsu for instance,\\nbut in reading over the research\\nabout chess in particular,\\nbut at also certain forms of martial arts,\\nalso certain forms of dance.\\nWhat one finds is that\\nindeed those games are life\\nin the sense that they involve\\nadopting multiple roles\\nand exploring contingencies\\nin a number of different ways.\\nSo there are some games\\nthat allow you to explore\\na much vaster landscape\\nof movements or of mental roles\\nor of ways of engaging\\nin strategic movement\\nas is the case with chess.\\nAnd so when you hear that,\\nyou know, activity blank is life.\\nIt often reflects the\\npassion for that activity,\\nbut I think looked at differently.\\nIt also reflects the\\nfact that that activity\\nis a portal through which\\nyou can explore life\\nthrough many, many different lenses.\\nAnd I think that that\\'s\\nespecially powerful\\nin terms of thinking about how play\\ncan be leveraged for plasticity.\\nSo for those of you that are\\ninterested in leveraging play\\nfor neuroplasticity and\\nexpanding your mind,\\nif you will,\\nI highly recommend picking an activity\\nthat will allow you to\\nadopt different roles\\nwithin that activity\\nwhere it\\'s not rigidly linear.\\nThis is actually a way in which\\nI start to depart from\\nthis modern and important,\\nbut somewhat narrow idea.\\nThat exercise is the\\nonly route to plasticity.\\nYes, it\\'s true.\\nI have Nobel Prize winning colleagues\\nthat swim for two miles a day\\nand have done on that for a long time.\\nAnd they will tell you,\\nI always think more\\nclearly after my swimming\\nand I certainly in my\\nexperience after a good run\\nor a good workout, my\\nmind seems to work best.\\nUnless of course, that workout\\nwas very, very intense.\\nI\\'ve talked about this before.\\nIf you do work out very, very hard\\nin whether or not it\\'s aerobic\\nor resistance training\\nor sport of any kind,\\nyou brain won\\'t function\\nas well afterwards,\\nmostly because of the diversion of oxygen\\nto tissues away from your brain,\\nyou actually are getting\\nless oxygen to your brain,\\nbut in general,\\nmost of us feel that if\\nwe exercise regularly,\\nour brain functions better.\\nBut there are activities that\\nextend beyond linear exercise,\\nbeyond just generating\\nthe same sets of movements\\nover and over again,\\nwhen or not it\\'s exercise or not.\\nAnd that\\'s really what play is.\\nPlay is about dynamically\\nexploring different kinds\\nof movements,\\ndynamically exploring\\ndifferent kinds of thoughts,\\ndynamically exploring\\ndifferent kinds of roles\\nthat one could adopt.\\nAnd that is the way that\\nthe brain learns new things.\\nSo I encourage you to explore chess.\\nI intend to learn chess this year.\\nI\\'m very excited to do that.\\nNow, if you already play chess\\nand you are an expert chess player,\\nyou actually will derive less benefit\\nin terms of this play\\ninduced neuroplasticity\\nthan you would, for instance,\\nif you went out,\\nand I don\\'t know, played a game of soccer\\nor did something that was very novel\\nfor your nervous system,\\nbecause in that novelty\\nand in that exploration of new behaviors\\nand new ways of thinking,\\nyou are opening the portal to plasticity,\\nwhereas in doing what you\\nalready know how to do\\nand trying just to perform\\nbetter and better at it,\\nyou will get better at chess,\\nbut again, that\\'s just chess.\\nYou are not expanding the realms\\nin which you can become more plastic,\\nthat you are able to learn new things\\nin relationship,\\nin life, in finance and\\nfriendship, et cetera.\\nIn researching this episode,\\none of the most interesting\\nareas I discovered\\nwas this notion of personal play identity,\\npersonal play identity is a term\\nthat at least to my\\nknowledge was coined by\\na Turkish researcher by the name.\\nAnd forgive me, I\\'m going\\nto mispronounce this\\nis Gökhan Güneş\\nG O K H A N,\\nlast name G U N E S.\\nAnd forgive me Gökhan\\nand if we have any Turkish\\nspeaking members of the audience,\\nplease put the correction in\\nthe comment section on YouTube,\\nmake it fanatic so I can\\nunderstand what it is.\\nPlease I\\'d love to\\ncorrect it and apologies,\\nor who knows if I got it right\\nthen it was pure luck.\\nGökhan Güneş has coined this\\nterm personal play identity,\\nand the key role that\\npersonal play identity\\nestablishes in who we\\nsee ourselves as being,\\nand not just in the context of play.\\nPersonal play identity\\nhas four well defined dimensions.\\nAnd I should say that if you\\'re interested\\nin learning more about this,\\nthe paper that I found\\nparticularly informative\\nis published in Current Psychology\\nand the title is \"Personal play identity\\nand the fundamental elements\\nin its development process.\"\\nAnd the author of course,\\nis Gökhan Güneş G U N E S last name.\\nThis is from 2021.\\nSo recent review.\\nThere are four components\\nto personal play identity,\\nhow you play,\\nyour personality,\\nsocio culture and environment.\\nSo that\\'s the third one that\\'s together,\\nsocio culture environment,\\nand economics and technology.\\nNow that sounds somewhat complex,\\nand this paper is somewhat complex,\\nbut basically what it says is that\\nwe bring together certain\\naspects of ourselves\\nand how we react to\\ndifferent place scenarios\\nwhen we\\'re younger.\\nAnd we bring that forward into the world.\\nIn all context as adults.\\nTo illustrate this,\\nI\\'m going to ask you a question,\\nwhen you were a child,\\nlet\\'s say 10 years old,\\nwould you have considered\\nyourself competitive?\\nWould you have considered yourself\\nsomebody who\\'s cooperative?\\nAnd realize of course\\nthat those are not mutually exclusive,\\nyou could be competitive and cooperative.\\nWould you consider yourself somebody\\nthat preferred to play alone\\nor preferred to play with\\none or two close friends?\\nOr were you somebody that\\nreally enjoyed playing\\nin large groups?\\nHere\\'s a key one.\\nWere you somebody that enjoyed\\nplaying the leader in one moment\\nand was equally okay\\nwith being a follower at a later moment?\\nWere you okay with\\nhaving your role switched\\nmidway through a game?\\nWere you get up upset or be delighted\\nor not care at all about\\nhaving to switch teams\\nduring the middle of game\\nbecause your team was winning right?\\nTo even things out,\\nyou can imagine how that\\nwould play out internally.\\nYou would immediately register\\nthat you must be a valuable player\\nbecause you\\'re being\\nmoved off the winning team\\ntoward the losing team.\\nBut then again,\\nyou\\'re now being forced\\nto join the losing team.\\nHow did you feel about that?\\nWere you somebody that was comfortable\\nwith other people breaking rules\\nor perhaps even yourself breaking rules\\nor bending rules,\\nkind of be able to find term,\\nor were you somebody that\\nreally needed to know all the rules?\\nAnd if everyone didn\\'t\\nrigidly adhere to those rules\\nwas quite disturbed by that?\\nThe number of questions\\ngoes on and on and on.\\nAnd I will provide a link to a paper\\nthat asks a number of questions\\nthat helps you arrive at\\na sort of score of sorts\\nor an index of what Güneş\\nand others have referred\\nto as personal play identity.\\nThe point is that\\nif we look back to our early adolescence,\\nsomewhere between 10 and 14 years old,\\na peak time for social development,\\na peak time for play of various kinds,\\na peak time for motor development,\\na peak time of psychosocial development,\\nwhere we learn where we\\nfit into hierarchies.\\nAs we relate to members of the same sex\\nof the opposite sex, et cetera,\\nwe can start to get a portal into\\nhow and why we show up to\\nvarious activities in work\\nand relationship, et cetera, as adults.\\nIn fact,\\nI\\'ll venture to say that\\nif we go into that process\\nfor ourselves for five or 10 minutes,\\nyou start to see some remarkable parallels\\nbetween the way you were at that stage\\nand your tendencies and\\nyour preferences as adults.\\nWe tend to look at our\\nearly childhood experiences\\nand our families,\\nand to some degree our friends\\nin terms of how we become who we become.\\nI\\'ve talked about the\\nincredible work of Allan Schore\\non previous episodes of the podcast.\\nAllan Schore is a psychiatrist\\nand has done extensive work\\non how parent child\\ninteractions in particular baby\\nand mother,\\nbut also baby and father\\nshaped the brain\\nand the brain and\\nemotional system\\'s ability\\nto go from states of\\nelation and excitement,\\nthe so-called dopamine\\nepinephrine type circuitry\\nto the more warm soothing\\ntypes of calm interactions\\nthat in broad terms could be described\\nas more serotonin oxytocin\\nand things of that sort.\\nThat work really points to the key roles\\nthat the caregiver\\nand the child you\\nengaged in an early life.\\nAnd that is incredible work.\\nI do hope to host Dr.\\nSchore on the podcast\\nat some point in the\\nnot too distant future,\\nbut equally important of course,\\nare the interactions that we export\\nfrom that early laying down\\nof biological circuitry\\nand psychological circuitry,\\nto the way we play by ourselves\\nand the way we play with others\\nin small numbers or in great numbers.\\nAnd of course it would be the case\\nthat how we played as a 10 or 12 year old\\nwould impact how we\\nbehave as a 16 year old\\nand as a 20 year old and as a 30 year old\\nand so on and so on.\\nOne of my favorite things\\nabout developmental biology\\nand developmental psychology\\nis that it is grounded in the fact\\nthat we don\\'t just have a\\nchildhood and an adulthood.\\nThere isn\\'t just our child\\nself and our adult self.\\nAnd even though there\\nare transitions around\\nthe mechanisms that\\nunderline neuroplasticity\\nat approximately age 25,\\nit is simply the case that development\\nis our entire lifespan,\\nthat our lifespan is one\\nlong developmental arc.\\nHow long depends on our\\ngenetics, our lifestyle\\naccidents, injury and disease of course,\\nbut it is one long developmental arc.\\nAnd so it shouldn\\'t surprise us at all\\nthat how we learn to play as\\na 10 year old or 12 year old\\nwould impact how we play\\nand interact with people\\nas a teenager and a young adult\\nand on and on and on.\\nAnd that play is the\\nplace in which we explore\\nin which we learn\\nplay is the substrate\\nby which our nervous system changes us\\nfrom this hyper-connected\\nbatch of neurons,\\nwhere everything is\\nconnected to everything,\\nmore or less\\nto a brain and nervous system whereby\\ncertain circuits work\\nwith immense proficiency\\nand others are less accessible to us.\\nBut again,\\nthe wonderful thing about\\nthe human nervous system\\nis that because it is plastic\\nfor the entire lifespan\\nand because these two\\nelements of focus and rest\\ncan be deployed again\\nand again, and again,\\njust because neural circuits didn\\'t form\\ndoes not mean that they\\ncan\\'t form later in life.\\nAnd today we\\'ve been\\nfocusing on how play itself,\\nthe same substrate that\\nwe use during development\\nto become who we are,\\nis the portal by which\\nwe can change who we are\\nfor the better.\\nSo I hope I\\'ve convinced you\\nthat play is an extremely important\\nfundamental homeostatically regulated\\naspect of our nervous system,\\nwhich is just a mouthful\\nof nerd speak to say,\\nplay can change your brain for the better.\\nAnd that is true for every stage of life.\\nThe recommendation that I make,\\nand certainly the one that\\nI\\'m going to direct it myself\\nas well\\nis to try and engage in at least one hour\\nof pure play per week.\\nNow I came to that recommendation\\nbecause of the literature that says,\\nwell, you need to engage\\nsomething pretty repetitively.\\nIt should be novel.\\nSo this wouldn\\'t be something\\nthat you are exceptionally\\ngood at already.\\nIf you insist on doing something\\nthat you\\'re already exceptionally good at,\\nthen you want to really do some free form,\\nlow stakes tinkering.\\nSo make it safe,\\nbut make it free form.\\nSo really explore things with that.\\nSome people call this beginner\\'s mind.\\nAlthough I find that a little abstract,\\nI like the notion of beginner\\'s mind,\\nbut sort of like,\\nhow do you know if you\\'re\\nin beginner\\'s mind?\\nI think beginner\\'s mind\\nis sort of the expectation\\nthat you\\'re not going to do it well yet,\\nbut play extends beyond beginner\\'s mind.\\nPlay is really about\\nnot even worrying if you\\'re\\ngoing to get good at it\\nor really proficient at it.\\nIt\\'s really about exploring contingencies\\nwith truly low stakes.\\nThat\\'s what will allow you to access\\nthese neurochemical combinations\\nof elevated endogenous opioids,\\nlow epinephrine, et cetera,\\nthat will open up neuroplasticity.\\nFor those of you that need\\na little more guidance\\non how to play.\\nThere\\'s a book out there\\nactually learned about this\\nfrom Tim Ferriss\\' blog,\\nit\\'s called \"Play It Away: A\\nWorkaholic\\'s Cure for Anxiety.\"\\nSo that\\'s more focused on anxiety.\\nThe author is Charlie Hoehn,\\nlast name H O E H N\\nwill provide a link for it in\\nthe show notes and caption,\\n\"Play It Away: A Workaholic\\'s\\nCure for Anxiety.\"\\nBut books and other resources aside,\\nI think one hour of play per week\\nis a reasonable amount of time\\nto engage in dedicated play behavior.\\nFor the purpose of opening\\nup these neural circuits\\nfor plasticity,\\nthe key feature of course,\\nis to not have immense proficiency\\nin that given activity,\\nor at least not the way you perform it.\\nAnd if you do gain\\nproficiency in that activity,\\nwell, then it becomes something else\\nit\\'s no longer about\\nplay it\\'s performance.\\nSo in that case,\\nyou would then want to\\nadopt a new play behavior.\\nYou\\'ll notice that I largely avoided\\nusing the word fun\\nthroughout this episode.\\nFun is a somewhat abstract term\\nand like many emotions and\\nmany verbal descriptions\\nof experience.\\nIt falls short in the context of\\na neurobiologic goal\\ndiscussion about play.\\nIf you have fun, terrific.\\nSome people might find,\\nhowever that engaging in play\\nis kind of uncomfortable.\\nWell there, your goal then\\nshould be to lower your level\\nof discomfort\\nby focusing less on the outcomes\\nand just simply engaging\\nin the behavior because,\\nwell, I\\'m telling you\\nthat it\\'s good for you,\\nbut hopefully you will tell yourself\\nthat it\\'s good for you\\nand that you will experience\\nthat it\\'s good for you.\\nThe literature certainly points to that.\\nAnd the literature certainly\\npoints to the fact that\\nplay is the way that we are built.\\nWe are built to play.\\nWe have brain circuits from back to front\\nand within our body that are there\\nfor play and they don\\'t disappear.\\nThey do not get pruned away\\nas we go from development to adulthood.\\nSo if ever you needed a\\nneurobiological explanation\\nfor why play is important\\nthroughout the lifespan,\\nit\\'s that.\\nIt\\'s that biology does\\nnot waste resources.\\nIt\\'s a extremely efficient.\\nAnd were the circuits for\\nplay not to be important\\nin adulthood.\\nThey would\\'ve been pruned\\naway, but I guarantee you,\\nthey are there in your brain\\nand nervous system now,\\nthey will be there tomorrow\\nand they will be there going forward.\\nSo my suggestion is that you use them.\\nOne hour per week.\\nIf

but\\nalso some additional topics.\\nSo these would include science based tools\\nfor things like focus for sleep,\\nfor learning and many\\nother topics as well.\\nIn previous episodes of\\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast,\\nwe often refer to supplements.\\nNow supplements aren\\'t necessary\\nor correct for everybody,\\nbut many people derive\\ntremendous benefit from them\\nfor things like sleep and focus and so on.\\nWe\\'ve partnered with\\nThorne that\\'s T H O R N E\\nbecause Thorn supplements are\\nof the very highest quality\\nin terms of the ingredients they use.\\nAnd the specificity of the\\namounts of the ingredients\\nthat are listed on the bottle\\nare actually what is in those bottle,\\nwhich is not the case for many\\nsupplement brands out there.\\nIf you\\'re interested in\\nseeing the supplements\\nthat I take, you can go\\nto thorne.com/u/huberman\\nSo that\\'s thorne.com/u/huberman.\\nAnd those supplements you\\ncan purchase at 20% off.\\nAnd if you navigate deeper\\ninto the Thorne site,\\nthrough that URL portal,\\nyou can also get 20% off\\nany of the other supplements\\nthat Thorne makes.\\nThank you once again,\\nfor joining me for this discussion\\nabout the incredible\\nbiology and psychology\\nand power of this thing that we call play\\nand last but certainly not least\\nthank you for your interest in science.\\n[Upbeat music]'"

professor of\\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\\nToday, we are going to\\ndiscuss the gut and the brain,\\nand we are going to discuss how your gut\\ninfluences your brain and your\\nbrain influences your gut.\\nAs many of you probably know,\\nthere is a phenomenon\\ncalled your gut feeling,\\nwhich tends to be something\\nthat you seem to know\\nwithout really knowing how you know it.\\nThat's one version of the gut feeling.\\nThe other is that you sense\\nsomething in your actual gut,\\nin your body, and that somehow drives you\\nto think or feel or act\\nin a particular way,\\nmaybe to move towards something\\nor to move away from something.\\nNow, today, we aren't\\ngoing to focus so much\\non the psychology of gut feelings\\nbut on the biology of gut feelings\\nand how the gut and brain interact.\\nBecause indeed your gut is\\ncommunicating to your brain\\nboth directly by way of\\nneurons, nerve cells,\\nand indirectly by changing\\nthe chemistry of your body,\\nwhich permeates up to your brain\\nand impacts various\\naspects of brain function.\\nBut it works in the other direction, too.\\nYour brain is influencing your entire gut.\\nAnd when I say entire gut, I\\ndon't just mean your stomach,\\nI mean, your entire digestive tract.\\nYour brain is impacting things\\nlike how quickly your food is digesting,\\nthe chemistry of your gut,\\nif you happen to be\\nstressed or not stressed.\\nWhether or not you are under\\na particular social challenge\\nor whether or not you're\\nparticularly happy\\nwill in fact adjust the\\nchemistry of your gut\\nand the chemistry of your gut in turn\\nwill change the way that your brain works.\\nI'll put all that together for you\\nin the context of what we\\ncall the gut microbiome.\\nThe gut microbiome are the\\ntrillions of little bacteria\\nthat live all the way\\nalong your digestive tract\\nand that strongly impact the\\nway that your entire body works\\nat the level of metabolism,\\nimmune system, and brain function.\\nAnd of course, we will discuss to tools,\\nthings that you can do\\nin order to maintain\\nor improve your gut health.\\nBecause as you'll also soon see,\\ngut health is immensely important\\nfor all aspects of our wellbeing\\nat the level of our brain,\\nat the level of our body,\\nAnd there are simple, actionable\\nthings that we can all do\\nin order to optimize our gut health\\nin ways that optimize\\nour overall nervous system functioning.\\nSo we will be sure to review those today.\\nThis episode also serves\\nas a bit of a primer\\nfor our guest episode\\nthat's coming up next week\\nwith Dr. Justin Sonnenburg\\nfrom Stanford University.\\nDr. Sonnenburg is a world\\nexpert in the gut microbiome\\nand so we will dive really\\ndeep into the gut microbiome\\nin all its complexity.\\nWe'll make it all very simple for you.\\nWe will also talk about\\nactionable tools in that episode.\\nThis episode is a standalone episode,\\nso you'll get a lot of\\ninformation and tools,\\nbut if you have the opportunity\\nto see this episode first,\\nI think it will serve as a nice\\nprimer for the conversation\\nwith Dr. Sonnenburg.\\nBefore we begin,\\nI'd like to emphasize that this podcast\\nis separate from my teaching\\nand research roles at Stanford.\\nIt is however, part of\\nmy desire and effort\\nto bring zero cost to consumer information\\nabout science and science-related tools\\nto the general public.\\nIn keeping with that theme,\\nI'd like to thank the\\nsponsors of today's podcast.\\nOur first sponsor is Athletic Greens.\\nAthletic Greens is an all-in-one\\nvitamin mineral probiotic drink.\\nI've been using Athletic Greens,\\nwhich is now called AG1, since 2012\\nso I'm delighted that they're\\nsponsoring the podcast.\\nThe reason I started\\ntaking Athletic Greens\\nand the reason I still\\ntake Athletic Greens\\nonce or twice a day\\nis that it covers\\nall of my foundational\\nvitamin and mineral needs\\nand also because it contains\\nhigh quality probiotics and prebiotics,\\nwhich is a topic that we're\\ngoing to talk a lot about today.\\nWith Athletic Greens, I can\\nbe sure that I'm getting\\nall the vitamins and minerals that I need.\\nSo if I'm missing anything in my diet,\\nI can compensate for that\\nwith the Athletic Greens.\\nPlus it has the probiotics and prebiotics\\nthat can also compensate\\nfor any deficiencies\\nthat I might have in creating\\nthe right environment\\nfor my gut microbiome.\\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\\nto claim a special offer.\\nThey'll give you five free travel packs,\\nwhich make it very easy\\nto mix up Athletic Greens\\nwhile you're in the car or on a plane\\nor otherwise on the move,\\nand they'll give year's\\nsupply of vitamin D3 K2.\\nWhile not everyone needs\\nadditional vitamin D3,\\nmany people do even if they're\\ngetting sufficient sunlight.\\nSo you get the year's\\nsupply of vitamin D3,\\nand it also has K2 in there.\\nK2 has been shown to be important\\nfor various aspects of calcium regulation,\\ncardiovascular health, and so on.\\nAgain, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\\nto claim this special offer.\\nToday's episode is also\\nbrought to us by LMNT.\\nLMNT is an electrolyte drink\\nthat contains no sugar.\\nIt does however contain sodium,\\nmagnesium, and potassium.\\nI've talked about sodium\\non the podcast before.\\nI think sodium can indeed be\\nproblematic for some people\\nwith hypertension or pre-hypertension,\\nbut for many people,\\nsodium is a great thing.\\nIt can increase blood volume\\nin ways that can be helpful to them.\\nIt can improve nerve cell function in ways\\nthat can be helpful to them,\\nand for me, anytime I'm\\nexercising and sweating a lot,\\nI want to replace my electrolytes\\nand that means replacing sodium\\nfor adequate neuron function,\\nmuscle function, and so on.\\nLMNT is formulated to help anyone\\nwith their electrolyte needs\\nand is perfectly suited for people\\nwho are following a\\nketogenic, low carbohydrate,\\nor paleo diet.\\nLMNT contains a science-backed\\nelectrolyte ratio\\nof 1000 milligrams of sodium,\\n200 milligrams of potassium,\\nand 60 milligrams of magnesium.\\nIf you'd like to try LMNT,\\nyou can go to drinklmnt.com/huberman\\nto claim a free LMNT sample pack.\\nYou only pay the cost of shipping.\\nAgain, that's drinklmnt.com/huberman\\nto claim a free sample pack.\\nToday's podcast is also\\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\\nInsideTracker is a\\npersonalized nutrition platform\\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\\nto help you better understand your body\\nand help you reach your health goals.\\nI've long been a believer in\\ngetting regular blood work done\\nfor the simple reason that\\nmany of the things that impact\\nyour immediate and long-term\\nhealth can only be assessed\\nwith a quality blood test.\\nAnd nowadays with the\\nadvent of modern DNA tests,\\nyou can also get insights\\ninto, for instance,\\nwhat your biological age\\nis and how that compares\\nto your chronological age.\\nNow, one of the major problems\\nwith a lot of blood tests\\nand DNA tests out there is\\nthat you get numbers back,\\nthey'll tell you if those\\nnumbers are in range\\nand out of range\\nbut they don't tell you\\nanything about what to do\\nwith that information.\\nWith InsideTracker, they\\nmake everything very simple\\nin terms of directing you\\ntowards particular protocols.\\nSo these could be nutrition protocols,\\nsupplementation protocols, or\\nlifestyle behavioral protocols\\nto help you bring those numbers\\ninto the ranges that are best for you.\\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\\nyou can visit insidetracker.com/huberman\\nto get 20% off any of\\nInsideTracker's plans.\\nThat's insidetracker.com/huberman\\nto get 20% off.\\nOkay, let's talk about\\nthe gut and the brain\\nand how your gut and your brain\\ncommunicate in both directions.\\nBecause as I mentioned before,\\nyour gut is communicating all the time\\nwith your brain and your brain\\nis communicating all the time\\nwith your gut.\\nAnd so the two are in this\\nongoing dance with one another,\\nthat ordinarily is below\\nyour conscious detection\\nalthough you're probably\\nfamiliar with the experience\\nof every once in a while\\ngetting a stomach ache\\nor of eating something that\\ndoesn't agree with you,\\nor conversely eating something\\nthat you find particularly delicious\\nand that sensation or\\nthat experience rather\\nbeing a whole body experience.\\nYour mind is excited about\\nwhat you're eating or just ate,\\nyour gut is excited about what\\nyou're eating or just ate,\\nand it seems to be a kind\\nof unified perception\\nof both brain and body.\\nToday, we're going to talk\\nabout how that comes about\\nin the negative sense.\\nLike, you know, when you meet\\nsomeone you really dislike\\nor when you have a stomach ache,\\nand in the positive sense,\\nwhen you interact with somebody\\nthat you really, really like\\nand you'd like to spend more\\ntime with them, for instance,\\nor when you eat something\\nthat you really, really like\\nand you'd like to spend\\nmore time with that food,\\nso to speak.\\nNow, the gut and the brain\\nrepresent what we call\\na biological circuit,\\nmeaning they include different stations.\\nSo station A communicates with station B,\\nwhich communicates with\\nstation C, and so on.\\nAnd as I mentioned earlier,\\nit is bidirectional.\\nIt's a two-way street\\nbetween gut and brain.\\nI want to make the important\\npoint at the outset\\nthat when I say the word gut,\\nwhen I refer to the gut,\\nI am not just referring to the stomach.\\nMost of us think that the\\ngut equates to the stomach\\nbecause we think of having\\na gut or not having a gut\\nor having a gut feeling of some sort.\\nBut in the context of gut-brain signaling\\nand the related microbiome,\\nthe gut includes the\\nentire digestive tract.\\nThat's right, from start to finish\\nthe entire digestive tract\\nso much so that today\\nwe're going to talk about,\\nfor instance, the presence\\nof neurons, nerve cells,\\nthat reside in your gut\\nthat communicate to specific\\nlocations in the brain\\nand cause the release of\\nspecific neurochemicals,\\nsuch as the neurochemical\\ndopamine or serotonin,\\nthat can motivate you to seek\\nmore of a particular food\\nor type of interaction or behavior,\\nor to avoid particular foods,\\ninteractions, and behaviors.\\nAnd some of those neurons,\\nmany of those neurons, in fact,\\nreside in your intestines,\\nnot in your stomach.\\nThey can be in the small\\nintestine or the large intestine.\\nIn fact, you actually have\\ntaste receptors and neurons\\nlocated all along your digestive tract.\\nYou have neurons that are located\\nall along your digestive tract\\nand they are communicating to your brain\\nto impact what you think, what\\nyou feel, and what you do.\\nOkay, so for the gut-brain axis,\\nwe need to deal with the brain part\\nand then we need to\\ndeal with the gut part.\\nLet's just quickly talk\\nabout the brain part\\nbecause there the word brain\\nis also a bit of a misnomer\\nin that when we say the gut-brain axis,\\nit does include the brain\\nbut includes a lot of\\nother things as well.\\nSo as many of you probably know by now,\\nif you're listeners of this podcast,\\nand if you don't, that's fine,\\nyour nervous system includes your brain\\nand your spinal cord\\nand those together constitute\\nwhat's called the central nervous system.\\nYour neural retinas,\\nwhich are lining the back of your eyes\\nand are the light sensing\\nportion of your eyes\\nare also part of your\\ncentral nervous system.\\nSo actually your eyes\\nare part of your brain.\\nThey're the only parts of your brain\\nthat are outside the cranial vault.\\nSo your retinas, your brain proper,\\nand your spinal cord make up\\nthe central nervous system.\\nThe other parts of your\\nnervous system constitute\\nwhat's called the\\nperipheral nervous system,\\nwhich are the components\\nof your nervous system\\nthat reside outside the\\nretinas, brain, and spinal cord.\\nNow, this is very important\\nbecause today we're going to talk a lot\\nabout how the gut\\ncommunicates with the brain.\\nAnd it does that by way\\nof peripheral nervous system components,\\nmeaning nerve cells that reside in the gut\\nand elsewhere in the body\\nthat communicate to the brain\\nand cross into the central nervous system\\nto influence what you think\\nand what you feel, okay?\\nSo that's the nervous\\nsystem part of what we call\\nthe gut-brain axis,\\nbrain, again, just being a shorthand\\nfor including all the\\nelements I just described.\\nGut, as you now know,\\nincludes all the elements\\nof the digestive tract.\\nLet's talk about the\\narchitecture or the structure\\nof the gut of your digestive system.\\nNow, not surprisingly\\nyour digestive system,\\naka your gut, begins at your\\nmouth and ends at your anus.\\nAnd all along its length,\\nthere are a series of sphincters\\nthat cut off certain chambers\\nof the digestive tract\\nfrom the other chambers.\\nNow, also along this tube that\\nwe call the digestive tract,\\nthere's great variation\\nin the degree of acidity,\\nor pH as it's sometimes called.\\nThat variation in acidity\\nturns out to give rise\\nto different little microenvironments\\nin which particular\\nmicrobiota, microbacteria,\\ncan thrive or fail to thrive.\\nAnd so the way I'd like you to think\\nabout the digestive tract,\\nthis gut component of the gut-brain axis,\\nis that it's not just one component.\\nIt's not just your stomach\\nwith a particular acidity\\nand a bunch of microorganisms\\nthat work particularly well\\nto make you feel good\\nand make your digestive\\npathways work well.\\nIt's a series of chambers,\\nlittle microenvironments,\\nin which particular microbiota thrive\\nand other microbiota do not.\\nAnd certain behaviors that you undertake\\nand certain experiences that you have\\nwill adjust those\\nmicroenvironments in ways\\nthat make particular\\nmicrobiota, certain bacteria,\\nmore likely to thrive and\\nothers less likely to thrive.\\nWe'll talk about how that was\\nset up for you early in life.\\nActually from the moment\\nthat you came into the world,\\nthat microbiome was being established.\\nIt was actually strongly impacted\\ndepending on whether or not\\nyou were born by C-section\\nor by vaginal birth.\\nAnd it was strongly\\nimpacted by who handled you\\nwhen you came into the world,\\nliterally the hands that were on you.\\nHow much skin contact you had,\\nwhether or not you were\\na preemie baby or not,\\nwhether or not you had pets at home,\\nwhether or not you were\\nallowed to play in the dirt,\\nwhether or not you were\\nallowed to eat snails\\nor whether or not you were kept\\nin a very antiseptic environment.\\nAll of those experiences\\nshaped these little microenvironments\\nand shaped what constitutes best or worst\\nfor those microenvironments, okay?\\nSo you have this long tube that\\nwe call the digestive tract\\nand it's very, very long.\\nIn fact, if we were to splay it out,\\nwe were to take all the curves and turns\\nout of the intestine, we would\\nfind that it is very long.\\nIt's approximately nine meters long.\\nNow, the structure of that digestive tract\\nturns out to be very important\\nin terms of gut-brain signaling.\\nOnce again, it's a tube\\nand the hollow of that tube\\nis called the lumen, L-U-M-E-N.\\nBut the walls of the tube\\nare not necessarily smooth,\\nat least not for significant portions\\nof the digestive tract.\\nFor much of the digestive tract,\\nthere are bumps and\\ngrooves that look very much\\nlike the folds in the brain,\\nbut these bumps and grooves\\nare made up of other tissues.\\nThey're made up of what's\\ncalled a mucosal lining,\\nso there's a lot of mucus there.\\nAnd if we were to look really closely,\\nwhat we'd find is that there are\\nlittle hairy-like cellular processes\\nthat we call microvilli\\nthat are able to push things\\nalong the digestive tract.\\nThe microbiota reside\\neverywhere along the lumen\\nof the digestive tract,\\nstarting at the mouth and\\nall the way to the other end.\\nAnd they reside within those microvilli\\nand they reside within the lumen.\\nAnd if we were to look really closely\\nat the bumps and grooves\\nalong the digestive tract,\\nwhat we would find is that\\nthere are little niches,\\nlittle areas in which particular things\\ncan grow and reside best.\\nNow, that might sound kind of gross,\\nbut it actually is a good thing,\\nespecially what's growing\\nand residing there\\nare microbacterial organisms\\nthat are good for your gut\\nand that signal good things to your brain.\\nAnd we will talk about what\\nthat signaling looks like\\nand how that's done and\\naccomplished in just a few moments.\\nBut I want you to get a clear\\nmental picture of your gut,\\nsomething that we don't often see.\\nAnd often when we think about the gut,\\nagain, we just think about\\nthe hollow of the stomach,\\nfood going in there, and getting digested,\\nbut it's far more complex\\nand actually far more\\ninteresting than that.\\nNow, I've been referring\\nto the gut microbiome\\nand to the microbiota and these bacteria.\\nLet me define those terms a\\nlittle bit more specifically\\njust to avoid any confusion.\\nThe microbiota are the actual bacteria.\\nThe microbiome is used\\nto refer to the bacteria\\nbut also all the genes as bacteria make,\\nbecause it turns out that\\nthey make some important genes\\nthat actually impact all of us.\\nYou have loads and loads\\nof these little\\nmicrobiota, these bacteria.\\nIn fact, right now you\\nare carrying with you\\nabout two to three kilograms,\\nso that's more than six pounds,\\nof these microbiota, these bacteria.\\nAnd if we were to look at\\nthem under a microscope,\\nwhat we would see\\nis these are relatively\\nsimple little organisms.\\nSome remain stationary\\nso they might plop down\\ninto the mucosal lining\\nor they might hang out on\\na particular microvilli\\nor they might be in one\\nof those little niches,\\nand others can move about,\\nbut they basically fill the entire lumen.\\nThey surround and kind of coat the surface\\nof the microvilli and they're tucked up\\ninto any of those little niches\\nthat are available to them\\nto tuck into.\\nIf you were to take the head of a pin\\nand look at it under the microscope,\\nyou could fit many, many hundreds,\\nif not thousands or more of\\nthese little microbacteria.\\nAnd the reason I say many,\\nmany thousands or more,\\nI'm giving a kind of broad range there,\\nis that they do vary in size\\nand, again, they vary as to\\nwhether or not they can move\\nor they don't move.\\nNow, they're constantly\\nturning over in your gut,\\nmeaning they're being born so to speak\\nand they're dying off.\\nAnd some will stay there\\nfor very long periods\\nof time within your gut\\nand others will get excreted.\\nAbout 60% of your stool,\\nas unpleasant as that\\nmight be to think about,\\nis made up of live and dead microbacteria.\\nSo you're constantly making\\nand excreting these microbacteria.\\nAnd which microbacteria you make\\nand how many stay inside\\nyour gut and how many leave,\\nmeaning how many are excreted,\\ndepends a lot on the chemistry of your gut\\nand depends very strongly\\non the foods that you eat\\nand the foods that you do not eat.\\nNow, just because what we\\neat strongly influences\\nour microbiome, meaning our microbacteria,\\ndoes not mean that there\\nare not other influences\\non what constitutes our microbiome.\\nOur microbiome is also\\nmade up by microbacteria\\nthat access our digestive\\ntract through our mouth,\\nthrough breathing, through kissing,\\nand through skin contact.\\nIn fact, one of the major\\ndeterminants of our microbiome\\nis who we interact with\\nand the environment\\nthat we happen to be in.\\nAnd that actually includes whether or not\\nwe interact with animals.\\nIn a little bit, I'll talk about some data\\nas to whether or not you grew\\nup in a home that had animals,\\nwhether or not you grew up in the home,\\nwhether or not there was\\na lot of social contact,\\nmeaning skin contact,\\nor whether or not you grew up\\nin a more animal sparse,\\ncontact sparse environment\\nand how that shapes your microbiome.\\nBut the simple point is that what you eat\\ninfluences your microbiome,\\nbut also what you do,\\nwhat you think, and what you feel,\\nand many of the low microbacteria\\nthat get into your digestive tract\\ndo so by way of social interactions.\\nIn fact, if you ask a neurobiologist\\nwhat the role of the microbiome is,\\nthey'll tell you almost certainly\\nthat it's there to impact brain function.\\nBut if you have friends\\nthat are microbiologists,\\nsuch as I do, they'll tell you,\\nwell, maybe the brain and\\nnervous system are there\\nto support the microbiome.\\nIt's the other way around.\\nYou have all these little microorganisms\\nthat are taking residence in our body.\\nThey don't really know what\\nthey're doing as far as we know.\\nWe don't know that they have\\nconsciousness or they don't.\\nWe can't rule that out, but\\nit seems pretty unlikely.\\nNonetheless, they are taking advantage\\nof the different environments\\nall along your digestive tract.\\nThey are taking advantage\\nof the sorts of social interactions,\\nfor instance, the people you talk to\\nand that breathe on you,\\nthe people that you shake hands with,\\nthe people that you kiss or don't kiss,\\nthe people that you happen to be\\nromantically involved with or not,\\nyour dog, your cat, your lizard, your rat,\\nwhatever pet you happen to own\\nis impacting your microbiome.\\nThere's absolutely no question about that.\\nSo hopefully now you have\\nsome sense of the architecture\\nof the digestive pathway\\nand you have some sense of the trillions\\nof little microbacteria that are living\\nall along the different components\\nof that digestive pathway.\\nBut what we haven't talked about yet,\\nand what I'd like to talk about now,\\nis what those little\\nmicrobiota are actually doing\\nin your digestive tract.\\nIn addition to just living there\\nfor their own intents and purposes,\\nthey are contributing, for\\ninstance, to your digestion.\\nMany of the genes that\\nthose microbiota make\\nare genes that are\\ninvolved in fermentation\\nand genes that are involved in digestion\\nof particular types of nutrients.\\nAnd in a little bit, we will talk\\nabout how what you eat can\\nactually change the enzymes\\nthat those microbiome components make,\\nenzymes largely being things\\nthat are responsible for digestion.\\nThey catalyze other\\nsorts of cellular events\\nbut in the context of\\nthe digestive pathway,\\nwe're talking about enzymes\\nthat help digest your food.\\nSo those microbiota are indeed\\nhelping you in many ways.\\nAnd if you lack certain microbiota\\nthat can help you digest,\\nit stands to reason that\\nyou would have challenges\\ndigesting certain types of foods.\\nThe other amazing thing\\nthat these microbiota do\\nis they change the way\\nthat your brain functions\\nby way of metabolizing or facilitating\\nthe metabolism of particular\\nneurotransmitters.\\nSo one of the ways that having\\ncertain microbiota present\\nin your gut can improve your\\nmood or degrade your mood,\\nfor instance, is by way\\nof certain microbiota\\nbeing converted into or\\nfacilitating the conversion\\nof chemicals, such as GABA.\\nGABA is what we call an\\ninhibitory neurotransmitter.\\nIt's involved in suppressing the action\\nof other neurons.\\nAnd that might sound like a bad thing,\\nbut all types of sedatives, for instance,\\nalcohol, and a lot of neurons\\nthat naturally make GABA\\ncan help quiet certain\\ncircuits in the brain,\\nfor instance, circuits\\nresponsible for anxiety.\\nIn people who have epilepsy,\\nthe GABAergic neurons, as they're called,\\ncan all often be disrupted\\nin their signaling,\\nmeaning they're not\\ncranking out as much GABA\\nand therefore the excitatory neurons,\\nwhich typically release other\\nmolecules like glutamate\\ncan engage in what's\\ncalled runaway excitation\\nand that can give rise to seizures.\\nSo the simple message here\\nis that the microbiota\\nby way of making neurochemicals\\ncan influence the way\\nthat your brain functions.\\nSo you want to support those microbiota\\nand we will give you tools\\nto support those microbiota.\\nBut the takeaway at this point\\nis that those microbiota\\nare making things locally\\nto help digest food.\\nOther microbiota are helping to make\\ncertain neurotransmitters like GABA,\\nand we'll also talk about\\ndopamine and serotonin.\\nAnd so the very specific\\nmicrobiota that reside in your gut\\nhave a profound influence\\non many, many biological functions,\\nespecially immune system function,\\nbrain function, and digestion.\\nSo that should give you\\na fairly complete picture\\nof your gut microbiome.\\nNow I'd like to talk\\nabout how your microbiome\\nand your brain communicate,\\nor more accurately, how your microbiome\\nand the rest of your\\nnervous system communicate.\\nNeurons, which simply means nerve cells,\\nare the cells that do\\nmost of the heavy lifting\\nin your nervous system.\\nThere are of course other\\ncell types that are important.\\nGlial cell, for instance, very,\\nvery important cell types.\\nYou have endothelial cells,\\nwhich are responsible for blood flow,\\npericytes and other types of cells,\\nbut the neurons are really\\ndoing most of the heavy lifting\\nfor most of the things we think about\\nin terms of nervous system function.\\nYou have neurons in your gut\\nand that should not surprise you.\\nNeurons reside in your brain,\\nyour spinal cord, your eyes,\\nin fact, all over your body,\\nand you've got them on your\\nheart and in your heart,\\nand you've got them in your lungs,\\nand you've got them in your spleen,\\nand they connect to all\\nthe different organs\\nand tissues of your body.\\nSo that's not surprising that\\nyou have neurons in your gut.\\nWhat is surprising, however,\\nis the presence of\\nparticular types of neurons\\nthat reside near or in the mucosal lining\\njust next to that lumen of the gut\\nand that are paying attention,\\nand I'll explain what I\\nmean by paying attention,\\nto the components of the\\ngut, both the nutrients\\nand the microbiota,\\nand thereby can send signals\\nup to the brain by way of a long wire\\nthat we call an axon, and can communicate\\nwhat the chemistry and what\\nthe nutritional quality\\nand what the other aspects of\\nthe environment are at the gut\\nat a given location up to the brain\\nin ways that can influence\\nthe brain to, for instance,\\nseek out more of a particular food.\\nLet me give you a sort of\\naction-based picture of this.\\nLet's say like most people,\\nyou enjoy sweet foods.\\nI don't particularly enjoy sweet foods\\nbut there are a few that I like.\\nI'm a sucker for a really\\ngood dark chocolate\\nor really good ice cream\\nor I got this thing for donuts\\nthat seems to just not quit\\nalthough I don't tend to\\nindulge it very often,\\nI do like them.\\nIf I eat that particular food,\\nobviously digestion starts in the mouth.\\nThere are enzymes there,\\nit gets chewed up,\\nthe food goes down into the gut.\\nThese neurons are activated,\\nmeaning that causes the neurons\\nto be electrically active\\nwhen particular components,\\ncertain nutrients in\\nthose foods are present.\\nAnd for the cell types,\\nor I should say the neuron\\ntypes that matter here,\\nthe nutrients that really\\ntrigger their activation\\nare sugar, fatty acids,\\nand amino acids.\\nNow, these particular neurons\\nhave the name enteroendocrine cells\\nbut more recently they've been\\ndefined as neuropod cells.\\nNeuropod cells were discovered\\nby Diego Bohorquez's\\nlab at Duke University.\\nThis is a phenomenal set of discoveries\\nmade mostly in the last 10 years.\\nThese neuropod cells, as I mentioned,\\nare activated by sugar,\\nfatty acids, or amino acids,\\nbut have a particularly\\nstrong activation to sugars.\\nThey do seem to be part of\\nthe sweet sensing system.\\nAnd even though I'm focusing\\non this particular example,\\nthey represent a really nice example\\nof how a particular set\\nof neuro cells in our gut\\nis collecting information\\nabout what is there\\nat a particular location in the gut,\\nand sending that\\ninformation up to our brain.\\nNow, they do that by\\nway of a nerve pathway\\ncalled the vagus nerve.\\nThe vagus nerve is part of\\nthe peripheral nervous system.\\nAnd the vagus nerve is a\\nlittle bit complex to describe\\nif you're just listening to this.\\nIf you are watching this,\\nI'll try and use my hands as a diagram\\nbut really the best thing to do\\nif you want really want\\nto learn neuroanatomy\\nis to just imagine it in\\nyour mind as best you can\\nand if you can track down\\na picture of it, terrific,\\nbut here's how it works.\\nNeurons have a cell body\\nthat we call a soma,\\nthat's where all the DNA are contained.\\nThat's where a lot of\\nthe operating machinery\\nof the cells are contained\\nand a lot of the\\ninstructions for that cell\\nof what to be and how to\\noperate are contained.\\nThe cell bodies of these\\nneurons or the relevant neurons\\nare actually up near the neck.\\nSo you can think of them\\nas a clump of grapes,\\n'cause cell bodies tend\\nto be round or oval-ish.\\nAnd then they send a\\nprocess that we call an axon\\nin one direction out to the gut\\nand they'll send another\\nprocess up into the brain.\\nAnd that little cluster near the neck\\nthat's relevant here is called\\nthe nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E.\\nThe nodose ganglion is a\\nlittle cluster of neurons\\non either side of the neck.\\nIt has a process that goes out to the gut\\nand a process that goes up into the brain.\\nAnd again, these are just one component\\nof the so-called vagus nerve.\\nThe vagus nerve has many, many branches,\\nnot just to the gut.\\nThere are also branches to the liver,\\nbranches to the lungs,\\nbranches to the heart,\\nbranches to the larynx,\\nand even to the spleen,\\nand other areas of the\\nbody that are important.\\nBut right now we're just\\nconcentrating on the neurons\\nthat are in the gut that\\nsignal up to the brain.\\nAnd what the Bohorquez lab has shown\\nis that these neuropod\\ncells are part of network.\\nThey're sensing several\\ndifferent nutrients,\\nbut in particular, when they sense sugar,\\nthey send signals in the\\nform of electrical firing\\nup to the brain in ways\\nthat trigger activation\\nof other brain stations that\\ncause you to seek out more\\nof that particular food.\\nNow, this brings us to\\nsome classic experiments\\nthat at least to me are incredible.\\nAnd these are highly reproducible findings\\nshowing, for instance,\\nthat even if you bypass taste\\nby infusing sweet liquid\\nor putting sweet foods into the gut,\\nand people can never taste\\nthem with their mouth,\\npeople will seek out more\\nof that particular food.\\nAnd if you give them the option\\nto have a sweet food\\ninfused into their gut\\nor a bitter food infused into their gut\\nor a sweet versus sour,\\nor a more sweet versus less sweet food,\\npeople have a selective\\npreference for sweet foods\\neven if they can't taste them.\\nNow, this is important to understand\\nin the context of gut-brain signaling\\nbecause we always think\\nthat we like sweet foods\\nbecause of the way they taste.\\nAnd indeed that's still true,\\nbut much of what we consider\\nthe great taste of a sweet food\\nalso has to do with a gut sensation\\nthat is below our conscious detection.\\nHow do we know that?\\nWell, the Bohorquez lab\\nhas performed experiments\\nusing modern methods and\\nthey're classic experiments\\nshowing that animals and humans\\nwill actively seek out more\\nof a particular sweet food\\neven if it bypasses this taste system.\\nAnd the reverse is also true.\\nThere have been experiments\\ndone in animals and in humans\\nthat have allowed animals or humans\\nto select and eat sweet foods,\\nand indeed that's what they do\\nif they're given the option.\\nAnd yet to somehow eliminate\\nthe activation of these neurons\\nwithin the gut that can sense sweet foods.\\nNow, there are a couple different ways\\nthat those experiments ave been done.\\nIn classic experiments\\nthat date back to the '80s,\\nthis was done by what's called\\nsubdiaphragmatic vagotomy.\\nSo this means cutting off\\nthe branch of the vagus\\nthat enervates the gut below the diaphragm\\nso that the other organs\\ncan still function\\nbecause the vagus is very important,\\nbut basically cutting off\\nthe sweet sensing in the gut,\\nstill giving people the\\nopportunity to taste sweet foods\\nwith their mouth,\\nand they don't actively seek out\\nquite as much of the sweet food\\nwhen they don't have this\\ngut sensing mechanism\\nthat we now know to be dependent\\non these neuropod cells.\\nMore recent experiments\\ninvolve selective silencing\\nof these neuropod cells.\\nAnd there have been a lot\\nof different derivations\\nof this sort of thing,\\nbut the takeaway from it\\nis that our experience of\\nand our desire for particular foods\\nhas everything to do with\\nhow those foods taste.\\nIt also has to do, as you probably know,\\nwith their texture and the\\nsensation of those foods\\nin our mouth, and even indeed\\nhow they go down our throat\\nsometimes can be very\\npleasing or very unpleasant.\\nAnd it also has to do with\\nthis subconscious processing\\nof taste that occurs in the gut itself.\\nAnd again, when I say gut, I\\ndon't just mean in the stomach.\\nThere are actually\\nneurons, neuropod cells,\\nfurther down your digestive tract\\nwhich are signaling to your brain\\nabout the presence of sweet foods,\\nas well as foods such\\nas amino acid rich foods\\nor foods that are rich in\\nparticular types of fatty acids\\nsignaling up to your brain\\nand causing you to seek\\nout more of those foods\\nor to consume more of those foods.\\nNow, you're probably\\nasking, what is the signal?\\nHow does it actually make\\nme want more of those foods\\nwithout me realizing it?\\nWell, it does that by\\nadjusting the release\\nof particular neuromodulators.\\nFor those of you that are not\\nfamiliar with neuromodulators,\\nthese are similar to neurotransmitters,\\nbut they tend to act more broadly.\\nThey tend to impact many\\nmore neurons all at once\\nand they go by names\\nlike dopamine, serotonin,\\nacetylcholine, epinephrine, and so forth.\\nSometimes people refer to\\nthose as neurotransmitters.\\nTechnically they are neuromodulators.\\nI'll refer to them almost\\nalways as neuromodulators.\\nThe neuropod cells signal by way\\nof a particular branch of the vagus\\nthrough that nodose ganglion\\nthat we talked about before\\nand through a number of different stations\\nin the brain stem,\\neventually cause the release\\nof the neuromodulator dopamine.\\nDopamine is often associated\\nwith a sense of pleasure and reward\\nbut it is more appropriately\\nthought of as a neuromodulator\\nthat impacts motivation,\\ncraving, and pursuit.\\nIt tends to put us into modes of action,\\nnot necessarily running\\nand moving through space,\\nalthough it can do that too,\\nbut in the context of feeding,\\nit tends to make us look around more,\\nchew more, reach for things more,\\nand seek out more of whatever it is\\nthat's giving us that sensation\\nof delight or satisfaction.\\nAnd again, that sense of\\ndelight and satisfaction,\\nyou might experience only consciously\\nas the way that something\\ntastes on your mouth\\nbut it actually is caused again\\nby both the sensations in your mouth\\nbut also by the activation\\nof these neuropod cells.\\nSo this is an incredible\\nsystem of gut-brain signaling,\\nand it is but one system\\nof gut-brain signaling.\\nIt turns out it's the system\\nthat we know the most about\\nat this point in time.\\nThere are other components\\nof gut-brain signaling\\nthat we'll talk about in\\na moment, for instance,\\nthe serotonin system.\\nBut in terms of examples\\nof gut-brain signaling\\nfor which we know a lot\\nof the individual elements\\nand how they work,\\nI think this neuropod, neuron\\nsensing of sweet foods,\\nfatty acids, and amino acids in the gut\\nand communicating that up to the brain\\nby way of the vagus and causing us\\nto seek out more of the foods\\nthat deliver those nutrients\\nis an incredible pathway\\nthat really delineates\\nthe beauty and the power\\nof this gut-brain axis.\\nLet me talk about timescales.\\nHere I'm talking about a\\nparticular type of neuron\\nthat is signaling up to the\\nbrain using electrical signals\\nto cause us to want to seek out\\na particular category of foods.\\nThat's happening relatively fast\\ncompared to the hormone\\npathways of the gut\\nwhich also involve neurons.\\nSo your gut is also\\ncommunicating to your brain\\nby way of neurons, nerve cells.\\nBut some of those nerve\\ncells also release hormones.\\nAnd those hormones go by names like CCK,\\nglucagon-like peptide 1, PYY, et cetera.\\nA good example of a hormone pathway,\\nor what's sometimes called\\na hormone peptide pathway,\\nthat is similar to the pathway\\nI've talked about before\\nbut a little bit slower\\nis the ghrelin pathway.\\nGhrelin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N,\\nincreases with fasting.\\nSo the longer it's been\\nsince you've eaten,\\nor if you're just eating very little food\\ncompared to your caloric needs,\\nghrelin levels are going to\\ngo up in your bloodstream\\nand they go up because of processes\\nthat include processes within the gut\\nand include the nervous system.\\nSo it's a slow pathway driving you\\nto seek out food generally.\\nAs far as we know, the\\nghrelin system is not partial\\nto seeking out of sweet foods\\nor fatty foods or so on.\\nGhrelin increases the longer it's been\\nsince you've eaten sufficient calories\\nand it stimulates a feeling of\\nyou wanting to seek out food.\\nWell, how does it do that?\\nIt does that again by\\nimpacting neural circuits\\nwithin the brain, neural\\ncircuits that include\\nwhat we call the brain\\nstem autonomic center.\\nSo it tends to make you feel alert\\nand quite, we say, high\\nlevels of autonomic arousal.\\nIf you haven't eaten in a while,\\nyou might think that you just\\nget really exhausted, right?\\nBecause we all hear that food is energy\\nand caloric energy is\\nwhat we need to burn,\\nbut you actually have a lot\\nof energy stored in your body\\nthat you would be able to use\\nif you really needed energy.\\nBut typically if we\\nhaven't eaten in a while,\\nwe start to get agitated\\nand we get agitated by way way of release\\nof the neuromodulator epinephrine,\\nwhich causes us to look\\naround more, move around more,\\nand seek out food.\\nThat all occurs in brain\\nstem autonomic centers\\nand in the hypothalamus.\\nWe did an entire episode\\non feeding behavior\\nand metabolism as well\\nand you can find those\\nepisodes at hubermanlab.com\\nso I don't want to go into a lot of detail\\nabout hypothalamic and\\nbrains stem centers.\\nBut there's a particular area of the brain\\ncalled the nucleus of the solitary tract,\\nthe NST as it's called,\\nthat's very strongly impacted\\nby these circulating hormones\\nand tends to drive us\\ntoward feeding behavior.\\nSo the important point here\\nis that we have a fast system\\nthat is paying attention\\nto the nutrients in our gut\\nor the absence of nutrients in our gut,\\nand stimulating us to seek out food\\nor to stop eating certain foods,\\nand we have a slower\\nhormone-related system\\nthat also originates in the\\ngut and impacts the brain.\\nBut all of those converge on\\nneural circuits for feeding.\\nThe neural circuits for feeding\\ninclude things like the arcuate\\nnucleus of the hypothalamus,\\nthey include a bunch of\\nother neurochemicals,\\nbut the point is that\\nyou've got a fast route\\nand a slow route to drive\\nyou to eat more or eat less,\\nright, to seek out food and\\nconsume it or to stop eating,\\nto essentially kickstart\\nthe satiety mechanisms\\nas they're called,\\nand those are operating in parallel.\\nIt's not like one happens first\\nthen stops then the other.\\nThey're always operating in parallel.\\nAnd I bring this up because\\nthere's a bigger theme here\\nwhich we see over and\\nover again in biology,\\nwhich is the concept of parallel pathways.\\nYou've always got multiple\\naccelerators and multiple brakes\\non a system.\\nIt's very, very rare to\\nhave just one accelerator\\nand one brake on the system.\\nAnd this will become important later\\nwhen we talk about tools for\\noptimizing your gut microbiome\\nfor healthy eating and for\\nhealth healthy digestion\\nand for healthy brain function.\\nI want to take a moment and talk\\nabout glucagon-like peptide 1,\\nwhich is also called GLP-1.\\nGLP-1 is made by neurons in the gut\\nand by neurons in the brain.\\nThis is a fairly recent discovery\\nbut it's an important one.\\nGLP-1 tends to inhibit feeding\\nand tends to reduce appetite.\\nThere are a number of drugs\\nreleased on the market now,\\none for instance goes\\nby the name semaglutide,\\nwhich is essentially an GLP-1 agonist.\\nIt causes the release of more GLP-1.\\nIt's being used to treat type II diabetes,\\nwhich is insulin resistant diabetes.\\nThis is different than type I diabetes\\nwhere people don't actually make insulin.\\nIt's also being used as\\na drug to reduce obesity.\\nAnd it seems pretty effective\\nat least in certain populations.\\nThere are certain foods and\\nsubstances that increase GLP-1.\\nI've talked about a few\\nof these on the podcast.\\nOne that I'm a particular fan\\nof for entirely other reasons\\nis yerba mate tea can\\nstimulate the release of GLP-1.\\nIn South America, it's often used\\nas an appetite suppressant,\\nprobably in large part\\nbecause of its effect on GLP-1 release,\\nbut probably also because\\nit does contain caffeine,\\nwhich is a bit of a stimulant,\\nwhich also can be involved in lipolysis,\\nwhich is the utilization of fat stores\\nfor energy and so forth.\\nA brief mention about yerba mate.\\nThere are some reports\\nout there that yerba mate\\ncan increase certain types of cancers.\\nThe data that I've seen on this\\nis that it tends to\\nrelate to whether or not\\nthose are smoked versions\\nof the yerba mate tea,\\nthe amount of consumption,\\nand the debate is still out.\\nSo I invite you to look at those papers.\\nYou can search for those online.\\nNonetheless, yerba mate is one\\nsource of GLP-1 stimulation.\\nSemaglutide is another source.\\nIt also can be stimulated\\nby various foods, nuts,\\navocados, eggs, and so forth.\\nCertain high fiber complex grains\\nwill also stimulate GLP-1.\\nI raise this as not necessarily a route\\nthat you want to take in\\norder to reduce food intake.\\nI don't even know that that's your goal.\\nBut that GLP-1 is another one\\nof these gut-to-brain signaling mechanisms\\nthat adjusts appetite\\nthat is dependent on diet,\\ndepends on what you eat or drink,\\nand that the GLP-1 pathway\\ndoes seem particularly sensitive\\nto the constituents of diet.\\nThere's at least one quality study\\nI was able to find showing\\nthat the ketogenic diet for instance,\\nwhich almost always involves ingestion\\nof very low levels of carbohydrate\\ncan increase GLP-1.\\nAlthough, as I mentioned before,\\nthere are other foods that fall\\noutside the range of what\\nwe would consider ketogenic\\nthat can also stimulate GLP-1,\\nand as I mentioned,\\nthere are prescription\\ndrugs, like semaglutide,\\nthere are other ones as well now,\\nthat stimulate GLP-1.\\nSo how does GLP-1 reduce appetite?\\nIt does that, in part, by\\nchanging the activity of neurons\\nin the hypothalamus,\\nthis cluster of neurons just\\nabove the roof of our mouth,\\nthat themselves make GLP-1\\nand that cause the\\nactivation of motor circuits\\nfor reaching, chewing, all the things\\nthat we associate with feeding behavior.\\nSo I use GLP-1 as an example of a pathway\\nthat you might choose to tap into\\nby ingestion of yerba mate\\nor by ingestion of the foods I mentioned,\\nor if it's something that\\ninterests you, ketogenic diet.\\nBut I also mention it simply\\nbecause it's another beautiful example\\nof how a hormone pathway\\ncan impact the activity\\nof brain circuits that\\nare directly involved\\nin a particular behavior.\\nSo yet another example of how\\ngut is communicating to brain\\nin order to change what we think we want\\nor to change what our\\nactual behaviors are.\\nSo the next time you find\\nyourself reaching for food,\\nor you find yourself wanting\\na particular sweet thing\\nor fatty thing or something that contains\\na lot of amino acids,\\na protein rich food,\\nkeep in mind that that's not just\\nabout the taste of the food,\\nand it's not even necessarily\\nabout the nutrients\\nthat you need or don't need.\\nIt could be,\\nbut it's also about this\\nsubconscious signaling\\nthat's coming from your body all the time,\\nwaves of hormones, waves\\nof nerve cell signals,\\nelectrical signals that\\nare changing the way\\nthat your brain works.\\nAnd this raises for me\\na memory of the episode that I\\ndid with Dr. Robert Sapolsky,\\nwho's a world expert\\ncolleague of mine at Stanford,\\nwho is expert on things\\nlike hormones and behavior.\\nBut we got into the topic of free will,\\nwhich is a bit of a barbed wire topic\\nas many of you know.\\nIt gets into the realm\\nof philosophy, et cetera.\\nAnd we were kind of batting back and forth\\nthe idea, I was saying, \\\"Well,\\nI think there's free will,\\nand can't there certainly be free will\\nor certainly the idea that we\\ncan avoid certain choices?\\\"\\nAnd Robert was saying, \\\"No.\\\"\\nIn fact, he said, \\\"Nah,\\\"\\nhe doesn't believe\\nthat we have any free will.\\nHe thinks that events in\\nour brain are determined\\nby biological events that are\\nbelow our conscious detection\\nand that occur seconds to milliseconds\\nbefore we make decisions or assessments\\nand, therefore, we just\\ncan't control what we do,\\nwhat we think, and what we feel.\\nAnd at the time I sort of didn't buy it.\\nI thought, I don't know.\\nI just, I guess I really\\nwanted to believe in free will.\\nAnd to some extent I still do\\nbut as we talk about how\\nthese neurons in our gut\\nand these hormones in our\\ngut are influencing our brain\\nand the decisions that we are making,\\nat the level of circuits,\\nlike the hypothalamus\\nand the nucleus of the solitary tract,\\nthese are areas of the brain\\nway below our frontal cortex\\nand our conscious perception.\\nThink these are examples that really fall\\nin favor of what Dr. Sapolsky was arguing,\\nwhich is that events that\\nare happening within our body\\nare actually changing\\nthe way our brain works.\\nSo we might think that\\nwe want the cupcake.\\nWe might think that we\\ndon't need to eat something\\nor do need to eat something\\nand that is entirely on the\\nbasis of prior knowledge\\nand decision-making that\\nwe're making with our head,\\nbut in fact,\\nit's very clear to me based on the work\\nfrom the Bohorquez lab,\\nclassic work over the years\\ndating back to the '80s,\\nand indeed back to the '50s\\nthat we'll talk about in a moment,\\nthat our body is shaping the decisions\\nthat our brain is making and\\nwe're not aware of it at all.\\nNow, the good news is that\\nwhether or not you believe\\nin free will or not, the simple knowledge\\nthat this whole process is happening\\ncan perhaps be a benefit to you.\\nYou can perhaps leverage\\nit to get some insight\\nand understanding and perhaps even a wedge\\ninto your own behavior.\\nYou might think, ah, I think\\nI want that particular food,\\nor I think I want to avoid\\nthat particular food,\\nbut actually that's not a decision\\nthat I'm making on a\\npurely rational basis.\\nHas a lot to do with what\\nmy gut is telling my brain.\\nSo we've largely been talking\\nabout chemical communication\\nbetween the gut and the brain.\\nChemical because even\\nthough these neuropod cells\\nare communicating with the brain\\nby way of electrical activity,\\nwhat we call action potentials,\\nand in neural language\\nwe call those spikes,\\nspikes of action potentials,\\nspikes of action potentials,\\nmeaning those neural signals,\\ncause the release of chemicals\\nin the brain like dopamine.\\nSo it's chemical transmission.\\nSimilarly, hormones, even\\nthough they act more slowly,\\nhormones like neuropeptide\\nY like CCK, like ghrelin,\\nthey are signaling chemically.\\nThey're moving through the body,\\nthey're going in there\\naffecting the chemical output\\nof different cells,\\nand they're changing the\\nchemistry of those cells\\nand the chemistry of the cells\\nthat those cells talk to.\\nSo that gives us one particular\\ncategory of signaling\\nfrom gut to brain, which\\nis chemical signaling.\\nBut of course there are\\nother forms of signals\\nand those fall under the\\ncategory of mechanical signaling.\\nYou're probably familiar with this.\\nIf you've ever eaten a very large meal\\nor consumed a lot of fluid,\\nyou experience that as\\ndistension of the gut\\nand that doesn't just have to\\nbe distension of the stomach,\\nbut distension of your intestines as well.\\nThat distension is registered by neurons\\nthat reside in your gut,\\nthe signals go up to your brain,\\nand communicate with areas of the brain\\nthat are responsible for suppressing\\nfurther consumption of food and/or fluid,\\nand, under certain circumstances,\\ncan also be associated with the activation\\nof neural circuits that cause vomiting\\nor the desire to vomit.\\nSo if ever you've eaten too\\nmuch or you've eaten something\\nthat doesn't agree with you,\\nthat information is communicated\\nby way of mechanosensors\\nthat sense the mechanics of your gut,\\npossibly also the chemistry of your gut,\\nbut mostly the mechanics of your gut,\\nsignal up to the brain,\\nand activate brain\\ncenters that are involved\\nin stopping the eating behavior,\\nand activation of an\\narea of the brain stem\\nthat is affectionately referred to\\nas the vomit center among neuroanatomists.\\nThis is a area that more appropriately\\nis called the chemoreceptor\\ntrigger zone, the CTZ,\\nor area postrema\\nand neurons in this area\\nactually will trigger\\nthe vomiting reflex.\\nSo the way that the gut\\nand the brain communicate\\nis both chemical and mechanical,\\nand it can be both for sake\\nof increasing certain types of behavior.\\nToday, we're talking mainly\\nabout feeding behavior\\nup until now anyway\\nbut also ceasing to\\neat, closing your mouth,\\nmoving away from food,\\nturning away from food,\\nall behaviors that we're familiar with\\nanytime we feel kind of sick\\non the basis of activation\\nof this mechanosensor\\nfor gastric distress.\\nSo we've got chemical signaling\\nand mechanical signaling.\\nAnd I also want to emphasize that we have\\ndirect and indirect signaling\\nfrom the gut to the brain.\\nDirect signaling is the kind of signaling\\nof the sort I've been talking\\nabout mainly up until now,\\nwhich is neurons in the gut\\ncommunicating with\\nneurons in the brain stem\\nthat communicate with\\nneurons in the hypothalamus.\\nAnd, of course, those are\\nalso going to interact\\nwith neurons of the prefrontal cortex\\nwhich is the area of a brain\\ninvolved in decision making\\nthe, you know, I think it was\\nthe shrimp that made me sick.\\nI'm going to, I just don't\\nwant any more of that.\\nOr I'm never going back\\nto that restaurant again\\nbecause after I ate there\\nabout an hour later,\\nI started feeling really not well.\\nI felt, you know, kind of feverish,\\nbut my gut didn't feel well,\\nmy digestion was really off.\\nAll of that kind of information\\nis handled in the prefrontal\\ncortex at a conscious level,\\nbut the immediate decision to stop eating\\nor to eat more of something\\nto move towards something\\nor away from it, that's\\nmade by neural circuits\\nthat reside at the, we would say,\\nthe subconscious level\\nbut what we really mean is below\\nthe level of the neocortex.\\nBelow the cortex means\\nessentially below our level\\nof conscious awareness.\\nSo we talked about two types\\nof information within the gut\\nthat are communicated to the brain,\\nchemical information, meaning information\\nabout the nutrients\\nthat happen to be there,\\nand mechanical information,\\ndistention of the gut or lack\\nof distention and so forth.\\nAnd we talked about how\\nthese neuropod cells\\ncan signal the release\\nof dopamine and circuits\\nwithin the brain to cause you\\nto seek out more of something.\\nNow, in a very logically consistent way,\\ndopamine is also involved in\\nthe whole business of vomiting.\\nYou might think, well, that\\ndoesn't make any sense.\\nI thought dopamine was\\nalways a good thing.\\nIt's involved in moderation\\nand reward, et cetera.\\nBut it turns out the area postrema,\\nthis vomit center in the brain stem,\\nis chockablock full of dopamine receptors.\\nAnd if dopamine levels go too high,\\nit can actually trigger vomiting.\\nAnd this we see in the\\ncontext of various drugs\\nthat are used to treat\\nthings like Parkinson's.\\nParkinson's is a deficiency in dopamine\\nor a lack of dopamine neurons typically\\nthat causes a resting tremor,\\ndifficulty in movement,\\nbecause dopamine's also associated\\nwith a lot of the neural\\ncircuits for movement.\\nMany drugs that are used\\nto treat Parkinson's\\nlike L-DOPA increase\\nlevels of dopamine so much,\\nor at least activate dopamine receptors\\nto such a great degree in\\ncertain areas of the brain\\nthat they can cause activation of things\\nlike the trigger to vomit.\\nNow, this should also make\\nsense in the natural context\\nof if you gorge yourself with food,\\ngorge yourself with food,\\ngorge yourself with food,\\nthe neurons in your gut\\nthat respond to that\\nare simply detecting the\\npresence of nutrients\\nbut they don't really\\nmake decisions themselves.\\nThey don't know to stop eating.\\nYour brain knows to stop\\neating or to eject that food.\\nAnd so it's a wonderful\\nthing that those neurons\\nare communicating with areas of the brain\\nnot just that stimulate\\nconsuming more food\\nbut that are communicating\\nwith areas of the brain,\\nfor instance, area postrema,\\nthat when dopamine levels get too high,\\ncause us to either stop eating that food\\nor in the case of vomiting\\nto eject that food.\\nSo I raise this not to give you\\na kind of a disgusting counterexample\\nto what we call appetitive behaviors,\\nthe things that we like to do more of,\\nbut simply to give you a\\nsense of just how strongly\\neven these reflexes that we think of\\nas feeling sick and vomiting\\nor the desire to seek out more food\\nare really being controlled\\nby a kind of push-pull system,\\nby parallel pathways that\\nare arriving from our gut\\nand the same neurochemicals,\\nin this case dopamine,\\nare being used to create\\ntwo opposite type behaviors,\\none behavior to consume more,\\none behavior to get rid of everything\\nyou've already consumed.\\nSo our brain is actually sensitive\\nto the amount of signaling\\ncoming from our gut\\nnot just the path by\\nwhich that signal arrives.\\nOur brain is very\\ncarefully paying attention\\nto whether or not the levels of dopamine\\nthat are being triggered\\nare within a normal range\\nfor typical eating behavior\\nor whether or not we've gorged ourselves\\nto the point where enough already.\\nNow, of course, mechanical signals\\nwill also play into area postrema\\nand into the vomiting reflex.\\nIf we have a very distended gut,\\nwe feel lousy.\\nIt just, it actually can hurt very badly,\\nand we will have the desire to vomit,\\nor we will just simply vomit.\\nMechanical and chemical signals\\nare always arriving in parallel.\\nThey never work in unison.\\nAnd so now we have chemical\\nsignals, mechanical signals,\\nand now I'd like to talk about\\ndirect and indirect signals\\nbecause almost everything\\nI've talked about up until now\\nare direct signals, a neural\\npathway that converges\\nin the brain to create\\na particular feeling,\\nthought, or behavior,\\nbut there are also indirect pathways.\\nAnd that's what takes us\\nback to the gut microbiome\\nand to these little microbiota.\\nAnd to just give you the takeaway\\nmessage at the front here\\nand then I'll give you\\na little more detail\\nas to how it comes about,\\nyou have neurotransmitters in your brain\\nand in your spinal cord and in your eyes\\nand in your peripheral nervous system.\\nThey cause the activation\\nor the suppression\\nof nerve activity,\\nmeaning they either electrically\\nactivate other nerve cells\\nor they cause other nerve cells\\nto be less electrically active.\\nAnd they do that by way\\nof neurotransmitters.\\nBut as it turns out,\\nthe gut microbiota are capable\\nof influencing metabolic events\\nand in some cases are capable\\nof synthesizing\\nneurotransmitters themselves.\\nSo what that means is\\nthat these little bugs,\\nthese little microbiota\\nthat are cargo in your gut,\\nthe six pounds of cargo,\\nthey actually can make neurochemicals\\nthat can pass into the bloodstream\\nand into your brain and actually impact\\nthe other cells of your\\nbody and brain indirectly,\\nso without involving these\\nvery intricate nerve pathways\\nthat we've been talking about.\\nIn other words, the foods you eat,\\nthe environment of your gut microbiome,\\ncan actually create\\nthe chemical substrates\\nthat allow your brain to\\nfeel one way or the other,\\nto feel great or to feel lousy,\\nto seek out more of a\\nparticular type of behavior\\nor to avoid that behavior.\\nAnd that would constitute\\nindirect signaling.\\nSo I've been talking a lot\\nabout the structure and function\\nof the gut-to-brain pathway,\\nfocusing mainly on feeding behaviors\\nand in some cases avoiding\\nfeeding or even ejecting food\\nfrom the digestive tract,\\nI'd like to drill a little bit deeper\\ninto this indirect signaling pathway\\nfrom the gut to the brain\\nbecause it bridges us\\nnicely from neuronal signals\\nin the gut to the brain,\\nhormonal signals from\\nthe gut to the brain,\\nto what also includes the microbiome,\\nwhich is what we started talking about\\nat the beginning of the episode.\\nAs I mentioned a couple of minutes ago,\\ncertain gut microbiota\\ncan actually synthesize\\ncertain neurotransmitters\\nthat can go impact the brain.\\nAnd we actually have some\\nknowledge about which microbiota\\ncan synthesize particular\\nneurotransmitters.\\nFor instance, the neuromodulator dopamine\\ncan be synthesized\\nby or from bacillus and serratia.\\nNow, these are just names of microbiota.\\nI don't expect that any of you\\nwould necessarily recognize them.\\nThese aren't the sorts of\\nthings that you necessarily\\nwould run out and buy\\nto get more dopamine.\\nBut the point is that\\nparticular gut microbiota\\ncan create dopamine in our gut\\nthat can get into our bloodstream\\nand can generally change our\\nbaseline levels of dopamine\\nwithin the brain and\\nother areas of the body.\\nI mentioned baseline levels of dopamine\\nbecause as I talked about on\\nan episode all about dopamine\\nbut I'll just repeat the basics here now,\\nwe have baseline levels\\nof transmitters or neuromodulators\\nthat act as sort of the level of the tide,\\nthe overall level,\\nand then we can have peaks of dopamine\\nthat are created by behaviors\\nor by ingestion of particular\\nfoods or drugs, et cetera.\\nSo bacillus and serratia tend to increase\\nour baseline levels of dopamine.\\nSo if it turns out that we are creating\\nthe right gut microbiome environment\\nthat these particular gut\\nmicrobiota can thrive in,\\nwell, then our baseline levels\\nof dopamine will be elevated\\nand in general, that leads\\nto enhancement of mood.\\nSimilarly, there are other gut microbiota,\\nfor instance, candida,\\nstreptococus, various enterococcus,\\nthese always have these kind of strange\\nand not so attractive\\nnames, at least to me\\nas a neurobiologist.\\nNonetheless, those particular microbiota\\nsupport the production of\\nor can even be metabolized\\ninto serotonin, which is a neuromodulator\\nassociated with mood,\\nwith social interactions,\\nwith a huge number of different types\\nof events and behaviors.\\nAgain, these gut microbiota when present\\nand allowed to thrive in our gut\\nwill increase our overall\\nlevels of serotonin\\nand riding on top of\\nthat level of serotonin\\nwill be the serotonin\\nthat's specifically released\\nin response to certain behaviors.\\nAnd I really want to drive home this point\\nof baselines and peaks.\\nThe baseline level of serotonin\\nmight set our overall mood,\\nwhether or not we wake\\nup feeling pretty good\\nor really lousy if our serotonin levels\\nhappen to be very, very low,\\nwhether or not we tend to\\nbe in a kind of a calm space\\nor whether or not we tend\\nto be somewhat irritable.\\nBut then of course individual\\nevents as we go about our day,\\nmaybe a compliment that we get\\nor maybe somebody says\\nsomething irritating to us,\\nwhatever it may be will also\\ninfluence levels of serotonin,\\nbut those serotonin events\\nare going to be related\\nto events at particular\\nneural circuits in the brain.\\nAnd this is an important topic\\nbecause I think that a lot of\\npeople hear quite accurately,\\noh, 90 to 95% of our serotonin\\nis manufactured in the gut.\\nAnd indeed that's true.\\nIt's manufactured from\\nthe sorts of microbiota\\nthat I just described.\\nAnd there are many, many experiments now,\\nmostly in animal models,\\nbut also some in humans that\\nshow that if the gut microbiome\\nis deficient in some way to\\nthese particular bacteria,\\nthat serotonin levels drop\\nand people's mood suffers,\\nmaybe even their immune system functions,\\nmaybe even it exacerbates\\ncertain psychiatric illnesses.\\nHowever, a lot of people take that to mean\\nthat the serotonin of the\\nbrain all comes from the gut\\nor mostly comes from the gut.\\nThat's not the case.\\nIt's still the case that you\\nhave neurons in the brain\\nthat are responsible\\nfor releasing serotonin\\ndirectly in response to certain\\nthings like social touch\\nor through other types of\\npositive social experiences.\\nSo we've got gut microbiota\\nthat can literally be turned into dopamine\\nand raise our baseline levels of dopamine.\\nWe've got gut microbiota\\nthat can literally raise our\\nbaseline levels of serotonin.\\nAnd indeed there are other gut\\nmicrobiota like lactobacillus\\nor bifidobacterium, excuse me,\\nhard complex names to pronounce,\\nbifidobacterium that can give rise\\nto increases in GABA levels,\\nthis inhibitory neurotransmitter\\nthat can act as a little\\nbit of a mild sedative,\\ncan reduce irritability, et cetera,\\nbut that's just the baseline,\\nthe kind of tide of those neuromodulators.\\nAgain, I want to emphasize\\nthat we still have\\nneurocircuits within the brain and body\\nthat are specifically\\nreleasing in a very potent way\\ndopamine, serotonin, and GABA.\\nSo the two things act in concert.\\nEven though the gut and\\nthe brain are acting\\nboth in parallel and directly\\ninfluencing one another,\\nit is a powerful synergistic effect.\\nAnd there are now hundreds of studies,\\nmaybe even thousands by this point,\\nmostly performed in animal models,\\ntypically mice, but also\\nsome studies in humans\\nthat show that creating\\nthe correct environment\\nfor these gut microbiota to thrive\\nreally does enhance mood and wellbeing.\\nAnd that when our gut\\nmicrobiome is not healthy,\\nthat it really can deplete our\\nmood and sense of wellbeing.\\nNow, there are two major phases\\nto creating a healthy gut microbiome.\\nOne you can control and the other one\\nis less under your control.\\nI get into this in a lot of detail\\nin the episode with Dr. Sonnenburg,\\nwhich is coming out\\nimmediately after this one,\\nthe following Monday, that is.\\nBut for now I want to just\\ncapture a few of the main points\\nabout the early establishment\\nof the gut microbiome.\\nIt turns out that the environment\\nthat we are exposed to,\\nthe things that come into\\ncontact with our skin\\nand digestive tract and\\nany other mucosal lining,\\neven the urethra, the nasal passages,\\nany opening to the outside world\\nthat brings in certain, excuse me,\\ncertain microbiota in the\\nfirst three years of life\\nis going to have a profound impact\\non the overall menu of microbiota\\nthat we will be able to\\ncarry within our body.\\nAnd it really does seem\\nthat getting exposure to\\nand building a diverse microbiome\\nin those first three years is critical.\\nThere's a lot of speculation and some data\\nas to cesarean delivered babies\\nhaving less diverse microbiomes\\ncompared to vaginally delivered babies.\\nThere have been attempts,\\nalthough not conclusive attempts,\\nto link that to the presence\\nof autism spectrum disorders,\\nwhich at least by some statistics\\nseem to be of higher probability\\nin cesarean deliveries\\nalthough there are other\\nstudies that refute that,\\nand I want to make that clear.\\nHowever, it's clear that\\nbabies do not get much,\\nif any, exposure to\\nmicrobiota inside of the womb,\\nmaybe a little bit, but not much.\\nBut that is during the birth process\\nand in the days and\\nweeks immediately after\\nthey arrive in the world\\nthat their gut microbiome\\nis established, that those gut microbiota\\ntake residence within the gut.\\nSo it will depend on whether\\nor not they were breastfed\\nor bottle fed.\\nIt'll depend on whether\\nor not they were exposed\\nto a household pet or not,\\nwhether or not they were\\nheld by multiple caregivers\\nor just by one,\\nwhether or not they were a preemie baby\\nand were contained in a\\nparticularly restrictive environment\\nin order to encourage\\ntheir further development\\nbefore they could be brought home or not.\\nI don't want to give the picture\\nthat if you were isolated\\nor you were delivered by C-section,\\nthat you're somehow doomed\\nto have a poor microbiome.\\nThat's simply not the case.\\nHowever, it is the case\\nthat the more diversity\\nof microbiota that one\\ncan create early in life\\nis really helpful for long-term outcomes\\nin terms of brain-to-gut signaling,\\ngut-to-brain signaling,\\nand for sake of the immune system.\\nThere are some decent studies showing\\nthat if children are exposed\\nto a lot of antibiotic\\ntreatment early in life,\\nthat can be very\\ndetrimental to establishment\\nof a healthy gut microbiome.\\nAnd fortunately that reestablishing\\na healthy gut microbiome\\ncan help rescue some of those deficits.\\nSo doctors nowadays are much more cautious\\nabout the prescription of\\nantibiotic drugs to children\\nin their early years, not\\njust up to three years,\\nbut extending out to five\\nand seven and 10 years.\\nAnd even in adults, they're\\nvery, very careful about that,\\nor they ought to be.\\nOne reason is the\\nexistence, or I would say,\\nthe proliferation of\\nantibiotic-resistant bacteria\\nthat are becoming more common\\nin hospitals and elsewhere\\nand that can cause serious problems.\\nBut in addition to that,\\nbecause of this understanding\\nthat the gut microbiome\\nis influencing and actually\\ncreating neurotransmitters\\nthat can impact mood and mental health,\\nimpact immune health, and so on.\\nAs I mentioned earlier, there are hundreds\\nif not thousands of studies\\nemphasizing the key role\\nof the microbiome on brain health,\\npsychiatric health, et cetera.\\nI want to just highlight\\na few of those studies\\nand in particular, some recent\\nstudies that come from labs\\nthat have been working\\non this sort of thing\\nfor a very long time.\\nOne of the more exciting\\nstudies comes from the work\\nof Mauro Costa-Mattioli's lab,\\nwhich is at Baylor College of Medicine.\\nMauro's lab has been\\nworking on mouse models\\nof autism spectrum\\ndisorder for a long time,\\nand looking at social behavior\\nusing a mouse model for a long time.\\nAnd they've been able to identify\\nparticular types of microbiota\\nthat when they take resonance in the gut\\ncan help offset some of\\nthe symptoms of autism,\\nat least the symptoms of autism\\nthat exist in these mouse models, okay?\\nSo again, this is not human work.\\nThis is work being done on mouse models\\nfor the simple reason that you can do\\nthese kinds of manipulations,\\nwhere basically they took mice\\nthat were in germ free-environments\\nor non-germ-free environments,\\nor they exposed mice to\\nparticular microbiota\\nand not other microbiota\\nand they discovered that\\na particular microbiota\\ncalled L. reuteri,\\nit's L. R-E-U-T-E-R-I.\\nTreatment with L. reuteri\\ncorrects the social deficits\\npresent in these autism models\\nand it does so by way of\\nactivating our old friend\\nthe vagus nerve,\\nbut not simply because the vagus nerve\\ntriggers the release of dopamine,\\nbut it turns out that this\\nparticular gut microbiota\\nL. reuteri can correct the social deficits\\nin this autism spectrum disorder model.\\nIt does that by way of\\na vagal nerve pathway\\nthat stimulates both dopamine\\nrelease and oxytocin release.\\nAnd they establish this\\nreally mechanistically\\nby showing, for instance,\\nif you get rid of the oxytocin receptor,\\nyou don't see this rescue.\\nNow, those are mouse models\\nso we have to take those with\\nthe appropriate grain of salt,\\nbut they're really exciting.\\nAnd they come to us in\\nparallel with other studies\\nthat are being done,\\ntaking the microbiomes of people\\nwho have one condition\\nor lack of condition,\\nand putting it into people\\nwho have one condition\\nor another condition.\\nLet me explain what I mean by that.\\nThe early discovery of the gut microbiome\\nand its potential to impact health\\nwas not in the context of\\nthe gut-to-brain pathway\\nbut rather it was in\\nthe context of colitis.\\nThis dates back to studies in the '50s,\\nwhereby people with very\\nsevere intractable colitis\\nfor which no other\\ntreatment was going to work\\nreceived fecal transplants.\\nSo yes, that's exactly as it sounds.\\nTaking the stool of healthy\\npeople who do not have colitis,\\ntransplanting those stools\\ninto the lower digestive tract\\nof people who do have colitis,\\nand they saw significant improvement,\\nif not rescue of the colitis.\\nThat was one of the first indications\\nthat something within\\nstool, of all things,\\ncould actually rescue another\\nindividual from disease,\\nwhich sounds kind of wild and crazy,\\nand may even sound\\ndisgusting to some of you,\\nbut as I mentioned at the\\nbeginning of the episode,\\nalmost 60% of stool is\\nlive or dead bacteria,\\nmicrobiota, and it really\\nopened up this entire field\\nof exploring how different microbiota\\nmight have therapeutic effects.\\nAnd indeed, that has\\nbeen shown to be the case\\nalso in fecal transplants for\\ncertain psychiatric illnesses.\\nThese are still ongoing studies.\\nThey vary in quality.\\nThese are hard studies to\\ndo for all sorts of reasons,\\ngetting the appropriate\\npatient populations,\\ngetting agreement, et cetera,\\nmaking sure that everything's\\nhandled properly.\\nBut what this involves\\nis fecal transplants\\nfrom individuals that lack\\na particular psychiatric condition\\nor metabolic condition into people\\nwho have a particular metabolic condition\\nand there has been tremendous\\nsuccess in some cases.\\nOne of the more powerful\\nand salient examples\\nis for obesity.\\nThere's some people for\\nwhich even if they ingest\\nvery low numbers of calories,\\neven if they go on a liquid protein diet,\\nsimply can't lose weight.\\nThese are somewhat rare disorders\\nbut these are people that would\\neither get gastric bypass surgery.\\nSome people are now getting\\nthese fecal transplants\\nfrom people that have\\nhealthy weight and they\\ntake the stool from them,\\nthey put it into lower digestive tract,\\nand they can see substantial\\nimprovement in weight loss\\nin people that were\\notherwise unable to do that.\\nIn some cases, actually\\nthey can start eating\\nrelatively normal levels of\\nfood and still lose weight.\\nSo pretty remarkable\\nand that tells us there's\\nsomething in these microbiota\\nthat's really powerful.\\nNow, how those effects\\nare generated isn't clear.\\nOne idea is that it's\\nimpacting the metabolome,\\ncomponents of the metabolism,\\nalmost certainly that's\\ngoing to be the case.\\nAnother idea is that it's\\nimpacting neurotransmitters\\nwhich change behavior and\\nfood choices within the brain.\\nAlthough, as I mentioned,\\nsome of these people\\nare already eating very\\nlittle food to begin with\\nso that's a little bit harder\\nof an argument to create.\\nThere are also some\\nsomewhat famous examples now\\nof how fecal transplants can\\nlead to negative outcomes.\\nBut those negative\\noutcomes further underscore\\nthe power of the microbiome\\nin impacting bodily health.\\nOne key example of this, for instance,\\nis transfer of fecal\\nmatter into another person\\nin order to treat something like colitis\\nand it effectively does that,\\nbut if the donor of the\\nstool, of the fecal matter\\nhappened to be obese or have\\nsome other metabolic syndrome,\\nit's been observed that the recipient\\ncan also develop that metabolic syndrome\\nsimply by way of receiving\\nthat donor's particular microbiota.\\nSo these microbiota can\\ncreate positive outcomes\\nor they can create negative outcomes.\\nNow, most of us of course,\\nare not interested in\\nor pursuing fecal transplants.\\nMost people are interested\\nin just creating\\na healthy gut microbiome environment\\nfor sake of immune system\\nand brain function.\\nAnd we will talk about how to\\ndo that in just a few minutes.\\nBut I just want to further underscore\\nthe power of the microbiota\\nin shaping brain chemistry\\nand in shaping things like mood\\nor other aspects of mental health\\nthat typically we don't\\nassociate with our gut.\\nThere are several studies\\npublished in recent years,\\none that I'll just highlight now,\\nfirst author is Tonya Nguyen, N-G-U-Y-E-N.\\nThe title of the paper is\\n\\\"Association of Loneliness and Wisdom\\nwith Gut Microbial\\nDiversity and Composition,\\nan Exploratory Study\\\".\\nIt's an interesting study.\\nLooked at 184 community\\ndwelling adults, excuse me,\\nranging from 28 to 97 years old.\\nThey explored whether or not\\nhaving enhanced microbial diversity\\nsomehow related to these variables\\nthat they refer to as\\nloneliness and wisdom.\\nThey used a number of different\\ntests to evaluate those.\\nThose are common tests in\\nthe psychology literature,\\nnot so much in the biology literature,\\nbut nonetheless, there are\\nways of measuring things\\nlike loneliness and wisdom,\\nwisdom in this case, being\\nthe opposite of loneliness,\\nat least in the context of this study.\\nAnd what they found was the\\nmore microbial diversity,\\nthe more diverse one's microbiome was,\\nthe lower incidence of loneliness.\\nAnd they did this by taking fecal samples,\\nprofiling them for RNA.\\nSo essentially doing gene\\nsequencing of the stool\\nof these individuals,\\ngetting ratings of how lonely\\nor not lonely they felt,\\nand correlating those.\\nAnd that's just but one study.\\nI point it out because\\nit's particularly recent\\nand it looked like it was\\nparticularly well done.\\nThere is another study that\\nI'll just refer you to.\\nThis was a study published in\\n2020 in \\\"Scientific Reports\\\".\\nThe title of the study\\nis \\\"Emotional Wellbeing\\nand Gut Microbiome\\nProfiles by Enterotype\\\".\\nWhat I particularly like about this study\\nis that they were able\\nto correlate the presence\\nof certain microbiota with\\nfeelings of subjective wellbeing\\nand lack of or presence\\nof depressive symptoms.\\nThey did high-throughput gene sequencing\\nof the microbiomes of individuals.\\nSo that meant measuring the microbiota,\\nfiguring out which\\nmicrobiota were present,\\nhow diverse their\\nmicrobiome was in general.\\nGut microbiome diversity is a good thing.\\nAnd then to correlate\\nthat with what's called\\nthe PANAS score.\\nPANAS stands for positive\\naffect negative affect schedule.\\nThis is a test that my\\nlab has used extensively,\\nthat other labs to use to\\nevaluate mood and wellbeing.\\nAnd they defined what were\\ncalled three enterotypes,\\nthree different categories of people\\nthat ate very different diets\\nthat tended to fall into\\ncategories of having more\\nor fewer emotional\\nsymptoms that were negative\\nor more fewer emotional\\nsymptoms that were positive\\nand whether or not they tend\\nto be more depressed, anxious,\\nor have more stress-related\\nbehaviors, et cetera.\\nAnd what they were able\\nto derive from this study\\nwas some strong indications\\nabout what types of things\\nwe should ingest in our diet,\\nmaybe even certain things\\nthat we should avoid,\\nbut certainly the types of\\nthings that we should ingest,\\nthat can enhance mood and wellbeing\\nand can tend to shift people away\\nfrom more depressive-like anxiety\\nand stress-related symptoms.\\nBefore we get into what the\\nparticular food items were\\nthat lend themselves to\\na healthy microbiome,\\nI want to raise a bigger and\\nperhaps more important issue,\\nwhich is what is a healthy microbiome.\\nI think if you asked any\\nnumber of world experts,\\nand I certainly ask\\nthis of Dr. Sonnenburg,\\nwhat is a healthy microbiome,\\nthey're all going to tell you\\nit's a microbiome that\\nhas a lot of diversity,\\nthat includes a lot of\\ndifferent types of bacteria.\\nAnd that makes sense\\nbecause it logically\\nwould include the bacteria\\nthat produce GABA and\\ndopamine and serotonin,\\nand that support the immune system,\\nand do a number of different things.\\nBut is it simply the case that\\nadding microbiota diversity\\nis always a good thing?\\nWell, that doesn't seem to be the case.\\nProbiotics and prebiotics,\\nboth of which can enhance\\nmicrobiotal diversity,\\ncan improve mood, digestion,\\nimmune system, and so on.\\nThat's been established but\\nit's mainly been established\\nin the context of\\npost-antibiotic treatment\\nor people that are recovering from illness\\nor people that have been very stressed\\nor have been dealing with\\nall sorts of challenges,\\nmental or physical,\\nand they are an attempt to\\nreplenish the gut microbiome.\\nHowever, it's also clear\\nthat excessive microbiota\\nbrought about by excessive\\nintake of probiotics\\ncan lead to things like brain fog.\\nThere's actually some good\\nstudies that point to the fact\\nthat certain metabolites\\nof the microbiome,\\ncertain chemicals produced in the gut\\nand in the body can actually\\nlead to brain fog states.\\nThis is thought to come about\\nthrough the lactate pathways\\nof the gut that can then impact the brain.\\nIf you want to look more into this issue\\nof whether or not probiotics\\ntaken in excess perhaps\\ncan lead to brain fog,\\nI'd encourage you to look\\nat a particular paper.\\nThis is a paper published\\nin \\\"Clinical and Translational\\nGastroenterology\\\".\\nAnd the title of the paper\\nis \\\"Brain Fogginess, Gas, and Bloating,\\na Link Between SIBO Probiotics\\nand Metabolic Acidosis\\\".\\nIt was published in 2018.\\nWe can provide a link to this study.\\nAnd there are several other\\nstudies in the references\\nthat point to the fact that in some cases,\\nexcessive intake of probiotics\\nand excessive proliferation\\nof gut microbiota can\\nactually be problematic.\\nI mention this not to confuse you\\nbut because it is confusing out there.\\nWe all would think that just increasing\\nmicrobiotal diversity\\nis always a good thing\\nbut there are thresholds\\nbeyond which excessive\\nmicrobiotal diversity\\nmight be problematic.\\nI think everyone agrees that having\\ntoo few microbial species\\nliving in us is not a good idea.\\nNow, none of that answers the questions\\nthat I think everyone\\nreally wants answers to,\\nwhich are, what should we do,\\nwhat should we not do to\\nimprove our gut microbiome?\\nI mean, clearly we can't time travel back\\nto when we were zero to three years old\\nand get a dog if we didn't have a dog,\\nget breastfed if we weren't breastfed,\\nbe delivered vaginally as\\nopposed to by C-section\\nif we didn't have that opportunity.\\nWe just can't time travel and do that.\\nAll of us, however, should\\nbe seeking to improve\\nthe conditions of our gut microbiome\\nbecause of the critical\\nways in which it impacts\\nthe rest of our brain and bodily health.\\nSo what should we do,\\nwhat shouldn't we do?\\nClearly we know that stress\\ncan negatively impact\\nthe gut microbiome.\\nHowever, some forms of\\nstress that can quote unquote\\nnegatively impact the microbiome\\ninclude fasting, long periods of fasts,\\nwhich makes sense because a\\nlot of microbiota need food\\nin order to thrive.\\nIn fact, many if not all\\nof them do at some point.\\nThere are other questions\\nsuch as should we eat particular foods\\nand how often should we eat those foods?\\nWe've all been told that\\nfiber is incredibly important\\nbecause of the presence\\nof prebiotic fiber,\\nwhich can essentially feed the microbiome,\\nbut is fiber really necessary\\nand how necessary is it to\\nencourage a healthy microbiome?\\nClearly, there are a number of people\\nfollowing relatively low fiber diets,\\nsuch as ketogenic diets,\\nand those can have, in some cases,\\nanti-inflammatory\\neffects and can sometimes\\nalso improve certain microbiota species.\\nSo it can all be rather confusing.\\nAnd for that matter, I\\nasked our resident expert,\\nDr. Justin Sonnenburg at Stanford,\\nall of these questions.\\nAnd he answers them very systematically\\nin the episode that\\ncomes out after this one.\\nBut I don't want to\\nwithhold anything from you\\nso I'll just give a\\nvery top contour version\\nof those answers and then\\nyou'll get more in-depth answers\\nduring that episode.\\nI asked about fasting.\\nAnd the reason I asked about\\nfasting is that years ago,\\nI was at a meeting as part\\nof the Pew Biomedical Scholars Meeting\\nand one of the other\\nPew Biomedical Scholars\\nwas an expert in gut microbiome\\nand I said, \\\"Hey, are probiotics\\ngood for the microbiome?\\nAnd if so, which ones should I take?\\\"\\nAnd his answer was very interesting.\\nHe said, \\\"You know, in\\ncertain cases they can be,\\nespecially if you're\\ntraveling or you're stressed,\\nbut it turns out that\\nthe particular bacteria\\nthat they put in most probiotics\\ndon't actually replenish the\\nmicrobiota that you need most.\\\"\\nAnd I thought, \\\"Oh, well,\\nwhy don't they make ones\\nthat replenish the microbiota\\nthat you need most?\\\"\\nAnd his answer was, \\\"Well,\\nthey don't replenish those\\nbut they replenish other ones\\nthat then in turn\\nencourage the development\\nof the microbiota that you do want\\nonce you start eating\\nthe appropriate foods.\\nSo they change the environment\\nwhich makes the environment better,\\nwhich indirectly supports\\nthe proliferation\\nof quote unquote good microbiota.\\\"\\nOkay, so that was a\\nsomewhat convoluted answer\\nbut I did appreciate his answer.\\nThen I asked him about fasting.\\nI said, \\\"Well, a lot of\\npeople are getting interested\\nin intermittent fasting now.\\nPeople are spending a significant portion\\nof each 24-hour cycle avoiding food\\nfor sake of time restrictive feeding.\\nWhat does that do to the gut microbiome?\\nDoes it make it healthier or\\ndoes it make it unhealthier?\\\"\\nWell, my colleague from\\nYale and Dr. Sonnenburg\\nboth confirmed that\\nduring periods of fasting,\\nespecially prolonged periods of fasting,\\nwe actually start to digest away\\nmuch of our digestive tract.\\nNow, the whole thing\\ndoesn't start to disappear\\nbut there's thinning of the mucosal lining\\nor the least disruption\\nof the mucosal lining.\\nA lot of the microbiota\\nspecies can start to die off.\\nAnd so it was surprising to\\nme, but nonetheless interesting\\nthat fasting may actually\\ncause a disruption\\nto certain healthy elements\\nof the gut microbiome.\\nBut again, there's a caveat.\\nThe caveat is that when people\\neat after a period of fast,\\nthere may be a compensatory proliferation,\\nmeaning an increase in\\nhealthy gut microbiota.\\nSo you start to get the picture\\nthat fasting is neither good nor bad.\\nYou start to get the picture\\nthat particular diets,\\nmeaning certain restriction diets\\nor macronutrient-rich diets\\nmay not be good or bad\\nfor the microbiome.\\nAnd yet there are some\\nanswers that arrive to us\\nfrom Dr. Sonnenburg, but from\\nother experts in the field,\\nthat there are certain foods\\nand certain things that we can ingest\\nwhich definitely enhance the microbiome\\nand make it healthier than it would be\\nwere we to not ingest those foods.\\nSo next I'd like to\\ntalk about what I think\\nis a really pioneering and\\nimportant study in this area.\\nThis is a study that was carried\\nout by the Sonnenburg lab\\nin collaboration with Chris\\nGardner's lab, also at Stanford,\\nwhere they compared two general\\ntypes of diets in humans,\\ndiets that were fiber rich,\\nwhich has been proposed\\ntime and time again\\nto enhance microbiota diversity\\nand to enhance gut-brain signaling even\\nand to enhance the immune system perhaps,\\nand diets that were enriched\\nin so-called low-sugar fermented foods.\\nBefore I dive into that study\\nand what the conclusions were\\nbecause they are very interesting\\nand very actionable for all of us,\\nI do want to touch on probiotics\\nbecause I want to avoid confusion.\\nIt is not the case that\\ningestion of probiotics\\nwill always lead to brain fog.\\nI want to make that clear.\\nIt is the case that\\ningestion of probiotics,\\neven if those probiotics\\ndon't directly contain\\nthe microbiota species that\\none is trying to proliferate,\\ncan be useful for improving\\nmicrobiotal diversity.\\nIn general, it seems that maintaining\\na healthy gut microbiome\\ninvolves ingesting certain types of foods,\\nand we'll talk about those in a moment,\\nbut perhaps also augmenting\\nthe microbiota system\\nthrough prebiotics or\\nprobiotics at a fairly low level\\non a consistent basis.\\nSo these are not high dose probiotics\\nexcept under conditions of dysbiosis\\nwhere, for instance, if somebody has done\\na round of antibiotics\\nand they need to replenish\\ntheir gut microbiome,\\nthere are foods and there are pill form\\nand powder form prebiotics and probiotics\\nthat can be very useful.\\nOr in cases where people\\nhave been very stressed\\nor are undergoing excessive travel\\nor have shifted their diet radically,\\nmaybe that's due to travel,\\nmaybe that's due to illness,\\nmaybe that's due to stress.\\nBut when there are a number\\nof different converging events\\nthat are stressing or depleting\\nmicrobiotal diversity,\\nthat's when at least I\\nbelieve it can be useful\\nto support the gut microbiome\\nthrough the ingestion of quality\\nprobiotics or prebiotics.\\nSo it would be under conditions\\nwhere people are stressed\\nor their system is generally stressed\\nfor environmental or\\nillness-related reasons\\nthat it might be useful to\\nlean towards higher doses\\nof prebiotics or probiotics\\nthan one might normally use\\nbut that under normal conditions,\\nthat one would focus on quality nutrients\\nthrough diet and focus on\\ningestion of probiotics\\nat a fairly low to moderate level,\\nand/or prebiotics at a\\nfairly low to moderate level.\\nThat just seems like the logical approach\\nbased on the experts that I've spoken to.\\nBut certainly if your doctor prescribes\\nor suggests that you take\\nhigh levels of probiotics\\nfor any reason,\\nyou should definitely pay\\nattention to your physician,\\nand you should obviously pay\\nattention to your physician\\nin any a case.\\nYou should never add or remove anything\\nfrom your nutritional plan\\nor supplementation plan\\nwithout consulting a physician.\\nSo what should we do in\\norder to maximize the health\\nof our gut-brain axis as it's called?\\nHow should we support the\\ndiversity of the good microbiota\\nthat help us create all\\nthese neurotransmitters\\nthat we want, improve our\\nimmune system function,\\nand so on and so forth?\\nWell, some of that is going\\nto be through the basics.\\nWhen I say the basics,\\nI mean the foundational\\nthings that really set us up\\nfor overall health.\\nSo this is going to be getting deep sleep\\nof sufficient duration 80\\nplus percent of the time.\\nI mean, if you could get a\\nhundred percent of the time,\\nthat'd be great but very\\nfew people accomplish that.\\nIt's going to be proper hydration.\\nIt's going to be proper\\nsocial interactions.\\nIt's going to be proper nutrition.\\nAnd we'll talk more about\\nnutrition in a moment.\\nIt's going to be limiting\\nexcessive, prolonged stressors or stress.\\nAnd indeed we've done episodes about,\\njust about all of those things\\nbut certainly about stress\\nwe have an episode of\\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast\\nthat you can find at hubermanlab.com\\nall about mastering stress,\\nhow to avoid long periods\\nof intense stress,\\nwhat to do to offset those.\\nGiven that stress can\\ndisrupt the microbiome,\\nwhether or not you're fasting or not,\\nthose tools ought to be useful.\\nNow, in what I consider\\nto be a landmark study\\nexploring the relationship\\nbetween the gut microbiome,\\nfood intake, and overall\\nhealth is this paper\\nfrom Justin Sonnenburg's\\nlab and Chris Gardner's lab,\\nboth of which are at Stanford.\\nAnd the paper entitled \\\"Gut\\nMicrobiome-Targeted Diets\\nModulate Human Immune Status\\\"\\nwas published in the journal \\\"Cell\\\",\\nwhich is among the three top\\njournals perhaps in the world,\\n\\\"Nature\\\", \\\"Science\\\", and \\\"Cell\\\"\\nreally being the apex\\njournals for overall science,\\nand especially for biomedical sciences.\\nNow, this is a very interesting study.\\nIt was done on humans.\\nThere were two major groups.\\nOne group of humans was\\ninstructed to increase\\nthe amount of fiber in their diet\\nand in fact ate a high fiber diet.\\nThe other group was instructed to eat\\na high fermented food diet.\\nNow, both groups started\\noff not having eaten\\na lot of fiber or a lot of fermented foods\\nand were told to increase\\nthe amount of either fiber\\nor fermented foods that\\nthey were ingesting\\nover a four-week ramp up period\\nand that was to avoid any\\nmajor gastric distress.\\nIt turns out that if you're\\nnot already accustomed\\nto eating a lot of fiber,\\nincreasing your amount\\nof fiber dramatically\\ncan cause some gastric distress\\nbut if you ease into it\\nover time, as we'll see,\\nthere's a mechanism behind this,\\nwhich was unveiled in this study,\\nbut if you ease into it over time,\\nthen the system can tolerate it.\\nLikewise high fermented foods\\ncan be readily tolerated\\nif there's a ramp up phase of ingesting\\nmaybe one serving a day,\\nthen maybe two servings,\\nand ramping up in this case\\nas high as six servings per day.\\nHowever, after this ramp up period,\\nthe group assigned to\\nthe high fiber condition\\nmaintained high fiber intake for six weeks\\nand the high fermented\\nfood group maintained\\nhigh fermented food intake for six weeks\\nafter which they went off\\neither the high fiber or\\nthe high fermented food diet\\nand there was a four-week follow up period\\nduring which they gradually\\nreturned to baseline.\\nThroughout the study their\\ngut microbiome was evaluated\\nfor the diversity of gut microbiota.\\nAnd there were also a number of measures\\nof immune system function,\\nin particular measures of\\nthe so-called inflammatome.\\nThe immune system has a lot of\\ndifferent molecules involved.\\nI did a whole episode\\nabout the immune system\\nif you're interested in learning\\nwhat some of those molecules are,\\nvarious cytokines and signaling molecules\\nthat reflect either\\nhigh inflammation states\\nor reduced inflammation\\nstates in the brain and body.\\nYou're welcome to check that episode.\\nIt's also at hubermanlab.com.\\nRegardless, in this study,\\nthey explored the sorts of immune markers\\nthat were expressed in\\neither of the two groups\\nand compared those.\\nThe basic takeaway of this paper\\nwas that contrary to what they predicted,\\nthe high fiber diet did not lead\\nto increased microbiota diversity,\\nat least not in all cases.\\nAnd that was somewhat surprising.\\nYou know, the idea is that prebiotic fiber\\nand a lot of the material\\nin fruits and vegetables\\nand grains and so forth\\nare supposed to support\\nmicrobiotal diversity\\nand the proliferation\\nof existing microbiota.\\nAnd that is not what they observed,\\nalthough I want to be\\nvery clear in pointing out\\nthat the results do\\nnot indicate that fiber\\nis not useful for health overall,\\nbut it does point to the fact\\nthat increasing fiber intake\\ndid not increase microbiota diversity,\\nwhich in general, as I mentioned before,\\nis associated with improvements\\nin microbiota function,\\nhealth, and overall wellbeing.\\nNow, the high fermented\\nfood diet condition\\nwas very interesting.\\nIt resulted in increased\\nmicrobiome diversity\\nand decrease inflammatory\\nsignals and activity.\\nSo there was a twofer.\\nBasically by ingesting\\nhigh fermented foods\\nin fair abundance, right?\\nYou know, four to six\\nservings or more per day\\nis a lot of fermented food intake.\\nWe'll talk about what\\nsome of those foods were.\\nBut the outcome was very positive.\\nThere was a clear increase\\nin microbiome diversity\\nand decreased inflammatory signals.\\nSo things like interleukin-6,\\na number of other\\ninterleukins and cytokines\\nthat are associated with\\nincreased inflammation\\nin the brain and body were\\nreduced significantly.\\nNow, let's talk a little\\nbit about this notion\\nof number of servings, et cetera.\\nOne somewhat minor point of the study,\\nbut I think is useful in terms\\nof taking an actionable stance with this\\nis that the number of\\nservings of fermented foods\\nwas not as strong a\\npredictor of improvements\\nin the inflammatome,\\nmeaning reduced inflammation\\nand improvements in microbiota diversity,\\nas was the duration of\\ntime that the individuals\\nwere ingesting fermented foods.\\nIn other words, the longer that one\\nis consistently ingesting\\nfermented foods on a daily basis,\\nthe better the outcomes in\\nterms of the gut microbiome\\nand for reducing inflammation.\\nSo I think that's an important point.\\nAnd I make that point,\\nespecially because for a lot of people,\\neven if you do this ramp up phase,\\nsix servings per day of fermented foods\\ncan seem like quite a lot.\\nSo what are these fermented foods?\\nI think many of us are\\nfamiliar with certain cheeses\\nand being fermented and\\nbeer being fermented\\nand kombucha is fermented.\\nIn this study, they focus specifically\\non low-sugar fermented foods.\\nSo this would be plain yogurt,\\nin some cases, kimchi or sauerkraut.\\nAn important consideration, however,\\nis that it needs to contain\\nwhat are called live active cultures,\\nwhich means there actually\\nhave to be microbiota\\nthat are alive inside the sauerkraut.\\nOne way you know whether\\nor not that's happening\\nis if you purchase sauerkraut\\nor pickles or kimchi\\nfrom a jar or a container\\nthat's on the non-refrigerated shelf\\nor the non-refrigerated\\nsection of your grocery store,\\nit is not going to contain\\nlive active cultures of microbiota.\\nAnd likewise, if you consume yogurt\\nthat has a lot of sugar or\\nother components added to it,\\nit's not going to have\\nthe same positive effect\\non the microbiome,\\nat least that's the prediction\\ngiven some of the relationship\\nbetween the sorts of\\nmicrobiota that live in sugar\\nversus plain type yogurts.\\nThey gave people the option of consuming\\nany number of different\\nlow-sugar fermented food.\\nSo that again that could\\nbe sauerkraut, kimchi,\\nthings like kefir, natto.\\nIn Japan, they consume natto\\nwhich is a fermented food.\\nBeer was not one of the fermented foods\\nthat was included in\\nthe fermented food list.\\nAnd when we say six servings per day,\\nthat is indeed six, six ounce servings,\\nor six, four to six ounce servings.\\nIt was not six servings of\\nwhat's listed on the package.\\nSo again, that turns\\nout to be a fair amount\\nof fermented foods.\\nHow should you gauge\\nwhether or not you're\\ngetting enough of this?\\nWell, if you decide to\\ntake on this protocol\\nof ingesting more fermented foods,\\nwhich at least by my read of this study\\nand some of the follow up\\nwork that's being done,\\nsounds like a terrific idea\\nif you want to improve your gut microbiome\\nfor all the great reasons\\nthat one would want to,\\nbrain-body health, reduced\\ninflammation, and on and on,\\nwell then you definitely want to focus\\non fermented foods that\\nyou enjoy consuming.\\nSo for you if that's kefir,\\nor for you that's plain yogurt,\\nor for you that's sauerkraut,\\nwhich happens to be my personal favorite,\\nthen you want to make sure\\nthat it's going to be something\\nthat you are going to enjoy\\ningesting quite a lot of\\nand that you're going to\\nbe okay with ingesting\\nprobably throughout the day.\\nNow, people follow different\\nmeal schedules, of course,\\nbut this does require not just eating\\nall the fermented foods just\\nbefore bedtime or at one meal.\\nI suppose you could do that,\\nbut in general, it's going\\nto work best in terms\\nof limiting gastric distress\\nby spreading it out throughout the day.\\nI also want to mention brine.\\nBrine is the liquid that\\nsurrounds sauerkraut.\\nIt's that very salty fluid.\\nAnd that contains a lot\\nof active live cultures.\\nAnd they did include or they\\nallowed people to include\\nbrine in this study.\\nAnd in discussions with Dr. Sonnenburg,\\nwhich we'll go into in\\nmore detail on the episode\\nthat comes out next week,\\nwe talk a lot about the particular value\\nthat brine might hold\\nin terms of bringing\\nabout microbiota diversity\\nbecause of the richness of\\nlive cultures that it contains.\\nI do want to focus for a moment\\non the high fiber condition\\nbecause there were some\\ninteresting observations\\nabout the people that were\\nplaced into that condition.\\nFirst of all, increasing\\nthe amount of fiber\\ndefinitely increased the number of enzymes\\nthat can be used to digest fiber.\\nThis is in keeping with this\\nidea of this ramp up phase\\nwhere accumulation of more fiber intake\\ncan over time lead to\\nless gastric distress\\nbut also to more utilization of fiber\\nwhich overall should be a good thing.\\nSo while they didn't observe an increase\\nin immune system function\\nor an increase in microbiota diversity,\\nthere was an increase in\\nthese fiber digesting enzymes.\\nThey also observed what they called\\npersonalized immune responses.\\nThere were some subgroups\\nwithin the high fiber group\\nthat had interesting changes in terms\\nof their reactions to, or I\\nshould say their inflammatome,\\nmeaning the inflammatory\\nmarkers they expressed,\\nas well as their microbiota diversity.\\nSo there were essentially three groups.\\nOne group actually showed an increase\\nin inflammatory markers.\\nSo that was quite surprising\\nand probably not wonderful for the message\\nthat fiber is always good for us\\nbut that was a small cohort\\nwithin the fiber intake group.\\nAnother group and still another group,\\nboth showed reductions in\\nbaseline microbiota diversity\\nalthough to varying degrees.\\nSo I don't want to paint the\\npicture that fiber is bad\\nbut fiber certainly did not\\nhave the positive effects\\non microbiota diversity\\nthat the high fermented food diet did.\\nSo my read of this study,\\nand I think the stance\\nthat many others have taken\\nas a consequence of these data,\\nis that we should be increasing\\nour fermented food intake,\\nthat that's simply a good\\nthing to do in order to support\\nour gut microbiome and to\\nreduce inflammatory signals\\nin our brain and body.\\nAnd there are a number of\\ndifferent ways to do that.\\nI mentioned some of the particular foods.\\nHowever, anytime you're talking\\nabout ingesting fermented foods,\\nespecially the high quality ones\\nthat come from the refrigerated section\\nof the grocery store,\\nand that have low sugar\\ncontent, et cetera,\\nwe do have to be considerate of cost\\nbecause certain things like\\nkombuchas, for instance,\\ncan be quite costly.\\nI should also mention some kombuchas\\nactually contain alcohol, some do not,\\nor contain very little amounts of alcohol.\\nOne way to avoid the high\\ncost of fermented foods\\nwhile still being able to accumulate\\na lot of fermented food intake\\nis to simply make those\\nfermented foods yourself.\\nAnd this is something that\\nwe've started exploring\\nand experimenting with in our home.\\nOne simple way to do this\\nis to just make your own sauerkraut.\\nIt involves very few ingredients.\\nIt basically involves\\ncabbage, water, and salt,\\nbut there's a specific process\\nthat you need to follow\\nin order to create these large\\nvolumes of sauerkraut at home\\nusing that low cost method.\\nThe best resource that I know of\\nin order to follow a great recipe\\nto make homemade sauerkraut\\nwould be the recipe\\nfor homemade sauerkraut that's contained\\nin Tim Ferriss's book, \\\"The 4-Hour Chef\\\".\\nThere's an excellent protocol there.\\nIt involves chopping up the\\ncabbage, putting into a bowl,\\nmashing it up with your hands,\\nwhich can be fun,\\nputting water in there,\\nsome salt, covering it,\\nand then keeping it in a\\nparticular environment,\\nand then routinely scraping off\\nsome of the material from the surface.\\nYou have to do that in order to make sure\\nthat you're not getting\\nmicrobes and things\\ngrowing in it that are bad for you.\\nSo you definitely want\\nto pay careful attention\\nto the protocol, but that's\\na very, very low cost way\\nof generating lots and\\nlots of fermented foods\\nso you don't go broke trying\\nto improve your microbiome.\\nThe other thing that you can do\\nif you're really obsessed with kombucha\\nor something like that, to\\navoid the high cost of kombucha\\nis there are ways that\\nyou can get the scoby,\\nwhich basically allows you to make\\nyour own kombucha at home.\\nI've never tried this,\\nbut when I was a post doc,\\nthere was an undergraduate in the lab,\\nI think, well, I won't out him,\\nbut he's now gone on to medical school\\nand I think he's passed his residency\\nand is a practicing doctor,\\nbut nonetheless, he was always\\nmaking kombucha at home.\\nHe told me it was exceedingly\\neasy, but then again,\\nhe had a number of other\\nskills and attributes\\nthat made me think that he could do\\npretty much anything with ease,\\nwhereas I tend to struggle\\nwith even basic cooking.\\nSo maybe if you're feeling\\na little more adventurous,\\nyou could explore making\\nyour own kombucha.\\nBut there are a number of\\ndifferent protocols and recipes\\nout there for making your own\\nlow-sugar fermented foods.\\nSo you needn't run out\\nand buy fresh sauerkraut\\nall the time.\\nI should also mention for those\\nof you that are interested\\nin getting your fermented\\nintake from pickles,\\njarred pickles rarely\\nif ever contain ferment.\\nMostly they're just\\nsoaked in vinegar, water,\\nand with some spices,\\nbut there are some that contain ferment.\\nYou actually have to look\\nfor that on the container.\\nAnd I don't know, maybe someone out there\\nknows how to make natto and\\nknows how to make kimchi well\\nand things of that sort.\\nIt certainly is the case based\\non the data from the study\\nthat ingesting more servings\\nof fermented food per day\\nought to be beneficial\\nfor our gut microbiome.\\nAnd since this is an episode\\nnot just about gut microbiome\\nbut gut-brain health,\\nI should mention that\\none form of signaling\\nbetween the gut microbiome and the brain\\nwhich we did not discuss\\nand I'll just touch on briefly\\nis that when the inflammatome\\nor the genes and markers\\nof inflammation are\\nkept in a healthy range,\\nthere's an active signaling\\nof that immune system status\\nto the brain.\\nThere's an intermediate\\ncell type that communicates\\nimmune status to the brain.\\nAnd that cell type is the microglial cell.\\nIt's a type of glia as the name suggests.\\nWhen there's a lot of\\ninflammation in the body,\\nthese microglia actually get activated\\nand can start eating away\\nat various components\\nof the brain and nervous system.\\nAnd I don't mean massive eating away.\\nThey're not going to\\ndigest the whole brain\\nbut these microglia are sort\\nof the resident macrophages\\nof the brain.\\nMacrophages are in the periphery\\nand they gobble up debris\\nand things of that sort.\\nThe microglia on a regular\\nbasis are eating up debris\\nthat accumulates across waking cycles\\nand in response to\\nmicro-damage to the brain\\nthat occurs on a daily basis.\\nSo they have a lot of\\nimportant basic everyday\\nwhat we call housekeeping functions.\\nBut when there's a lot of\\ninflammation in the body,\\nwhen there's a massive immune response,\\nthe microglia can be hyperactivated\\nand that's thought to lead to any number\\nof different cognitive defects\\nor challenges thinking,\\nor maybe even some forms of\\nneurodegeneration over time,\\nalthough that last point\\nis more of a hypothesis\\nthan a well tamped down\\nfact at this point.\\nThere's still a lot of\\ninvestigation to be done in humans.\\nThe animal data, however,\\nare very, very strong\\nthat when the immune system is activated\\nor chronically activated or hyperactivated\\nthat neural tissue, meaning brain tissue\\nand other central nervous\\nsystem tissue can suffer.\\nSo there are a lot of reasons to want\\nto not just improve microbiome diversity,\\nbut to also improve immune system function\\nand to limit the number\\nof inflammatory markers\\nthat are present in the body\\nbecause of the way those\\ninflammatory markers\\ncan signal deleterious\\nevents in the brain.\\nAnd while eating fermented foods\\nand making your own fermented foods\\nand buying high quality fermented foods\\nmight seem like an inconvenience,\\nI would say that from the perspective\\nof cost-benefit or effort-benefit,\\nit's actually quite a good situation\\nwhere if you can just ramp up\\nthe number of fermented foods\\nor servings of fermented foods\\nthat you're eating per day\\nover a period of a few weeks\\nso that you're tolerating that well,\\nthat ought to have a very positive effect\\non your microbiome diversity\\nand indeed on gut-brain function.\\nAnd I'll be the last to suggest\\nthat people completely forego on fiber.\\nI think there's some debate out there\\nas to how much fiber we\\nneed and whether or not\\ncertain forms of fiber\\nare better than others.\\nI'm not going to get into that debate.\\nIt's barbed wire enough without\\nme injecting my own views\\ninto that debate.\\nBut I think there's ample\\nevidence to support the fact\\nthat for most people ingesting\\na fair amount of fiber\\nis going to be a good idea.\\nI would just say that\\nmake sure that you're also\\ningesting a fair amount\\nof fermented foods.\\nAnd along the lines of fiber,\\nin an accompanying article\\npublished in \\\"Cell\\\",\\nwhich was sort of a what we\\ncall a news and views piece\\nabout the Sonnenburg and Gardner paper,\\nthey make a quite good point,\\nwhich is that the increase in fiber intake\\nthat led to the increase in\\ncarbohydrate active enzymes,\\nthese CAZymes as they're called,\\nthese are enzymes that help digest fiber,\\nquote, \\\"indicating an enhanced\\ncapacity for the microbiome\\nto degrade complex carbohydrates\\npresent in fibrous foods\\\".\\nSo in other words, eating\\nmore fiber and fibrous foods\\nallowed for an increase in these enzymes\\nthat allow you to eat\\nstill more fibrous foods\\nor to better digest fibrous\\nfoods that are coming in\\nthrough other sources.\\nSo there is at least one\\nutility for increasing fiber\\neven though it's separate from\\nthe gut microbiotal diversity\\nand reducing inflammation.\\nAnd I'd be remiss if I didn't\\ntouch on some of the data\\nand controversy about\\nartificial sweeteners\\nand the gut microbiome.\\nI want to be very clear that\\nwhat I'm about to tell you\\nhas only been established\\nin animal models,\\nin a mouse model, at\\nleast to my knowledge.\\nWhat the studies have shown,\\nand there were several,\\nbut one published in the journal \\\"Nature\\\"\\na few years back is the one\\nthat got the most amount of attention\\nis that animals that consume large amounts\\nof artificial sweeteners.\\nin particular things like\\nsaccharin or sucralose\\nshow disruptions in their gut microbiome.\\nI'm not aware of any studies in humans\\nthat show the equivalent effect.\\nAnd I'm not aware of any\\nstudies in humans that show\\nthe equivalent effect for things\\nlike plant-based, low-calorie sweeteners,\\nthings like Stevia, monk\\nfruit, and things of that sort.\\nAnd at least by my exploration,\\nI couldn't find any data specifically\\nrelated to the sweetener aspartame.\\nSo right now it's somewhat controversial\\nand actually this is kind of\\na third rail topic out there.\\nWhen one group will come out saying\\nthat artificial sweeteners are bad\\nbecause they disrupt the gut microbiome,\\nthe response generally from\\na number of people as well,\\nthat's only been shown in animal models.\\nAnd indeed that's true.\\nSo right now I don't think\\nthat there's a strong case\\none way or the other.\\nI think that people should\\nbasically ask themselves\\nwhether or not they like\\nartificial sweeteners or not,\\nwhether or not they're\\nwilling to risk it or not,\\nand obviously that's an individual choice.\\nI also want to point out a recent study\\nfrom Diego Bohorquez's lab,\\nwhich actually shows, however,\\nthat neurons in the gut,\\nthose neuropod cells, are\\nactually capable of distinguishing\\nbetween real sugars and\\nartificial sweeteners.\\nThis is a really interesting body of work.\\nIt was published just now, just recently,\\nI should say, February 2022.\\nThe title of the paper is\\n\\\"The Preference for Sugar\\nover Sweetener Depends\\non a Gut Sensor Cell\\\".\\nAnd to make a long story short,\\nwhat they showed was there's\\na category of neuropod cells\\nthat recognize sugar in the\\ngut and signal that information\\nabout the presence of sugar\\nin the gut to the brain\\nvia the pathways we talked about before,\\nthe nodose ganglia, the vagus, dopamine,\\net cetera, et cetera.\\nInterestingly, the very\\nsame category of neurons\\ncan respond to artificial sweeteners\\nand signal that information to the brain,\\nbut the pattern of signaling\\nand indeed the signature pattern\\nthat is conveyed to the brain\\nand received by the brain\\nis actually quite a bit different\\nwhen these same neurons are responding\\nto artificial sweeteners\\nversus actual sugar.\\nAnd this is very interesting\\nbecause what it means\\nis first of all that neurons\\nhave incredible specificity\\nin terms of what they are\\nsignaling from the gut\\nto the brain.\\nAnd it also means that there\\nmay be a particular signal\\nthat the brain receives that says\\nI'm receiving some intake of food or drink\\nthat tastes sweet but doesn't\\nactually offer much nutrients\\nin the direction of sweetness,\\nmeaning that it doesn't have\\ncalories despite being sweet.\\nNow, again, this is all\\nsubconscious processing.\\nAnd like with the previous studies\\nwe were just discussing\\nabout artificial sweeteners\\ngenerally and the gut\\nmicrobiome generally,\\nit's unclear how this relates to humans\\nat this point in time.\\nBut given the similarity\\nof cellular processes\\nand molecular processes at the\\nlevel of gut-brain in mice,\\nI think it stands to reason\\nthat these neuropod cells\\nvery likely are capable of\\nsignaling sweet presence\\nof real sweetener versus\\nartificial sweetener\\nin humans as well,\\nalthough that still remains\\nto be determined empirically.\\nSo I'd like to just briefly\\nrecap what I've covered today.\\nI started off by talking about\\nthe structure and function\\nof the gut-brain axis.\\nI described the basic\\nstructure and function\\nof the digestive pathway,\\nand how that digestive pathway\\nharbors microbiotal species,\\nmeaning many, many little\\nbacteria that can signal\\nall sorts of things to the\\nrest of the brain and body.\\nAnd indeed, we talked about\\nthe various ways they do that.\\nWe talked about direct pathways,\\nliterally nerve networks\\nthat extend from the gut\\nup to the brain and from\\nthe brain back to the gut.\\nAnd we talked about indirect pathways,\\nhow some of the gut microbiota\\ncan actually synthesize\\nneurotransmitters that get\\nout into the bloodstream,\\ncan impact the body,\\ncan impact the immune system,\\nand can get into the brain\\nand act as neurotransmitters\\nin the brain just as\\nwould neurotransmitters\\nthat originate from within the brain.\\nWe also talked about what constitutes\\na healthy versus unhealthy microbiome.\\nAnd it's very clear that\\nhaving a diverse microbiome\\nis healthier than having\\na non-diverse microbiome.\\nBut as I pointed out,\\nthere's still a lot of\\nquestions as to exactly\\nwhat microbiota species\\nyou want to enhance\\nand which ones you want\\nto suppress in the gut\\nin order to achieve the best\\ngut-brain axis function.\\nWe talked about how things\\nlike fasting might impact\\nthe microbiome and how\\nsome of that might be\\na little bit counterintuitive\\nbased on some of the other\\npositive effects of fasting,\\nor if we're not just discussing fasting,\\nsome other types of\\nsomewhat restrictive diets\\neither restrictive in time or restrictive\\nin terms of macronutrient intake,\\nhow those may or may\\nnot improve the health\\nof gut microbiome.\\nAnd the basic takeaway was\\nthat because we don't know\\nexactly how specific diets\\nimpact the gut microbiome,\\nand we don't know how fasting\\neither promotes or\\ndegrades the microbiome,\\nwe really can't say whether\\nor not they are improving\\nor degrading the microbiome at this time.\\nHowever, it is clear that stress,\\nin particular chronic stress,\\ncan disrupt the gut microbiome.\\nIt's also clear, of course,\\nthat antibiotics can\\ndisrupt the gut microbiome.\\nAnd that brings us to the topic\\nof prebiotics and probiotics.\\nAnd I emphasized the fact\\nthat for most people,\\ningesting high quality non-processed foods\\nthat includes some prebiotic fiber\\nbut also that includes some probiotics\\nwill probably be healthy\\nbut not excessive levels of probiotics.\\nHigh levels of supplemented probiotics\\nof the sort that would\\ncome in a probiotic pill\\nor even prescription probiotics\\nwould probably lend\\nthemselves best to when people\\nwere under severe chronic stress\\nor had just come off a serious round\\nor an ongoing or repeated\\nrounds of antibiotics.\\nThat does not mean that\\ningesting probiotics\\nin any form or any kind is not good.\\nIt just means that the\\nvery high dose probiotics,\\nagain, typically found\\nin prescription form\\nor capsule pill form\\nprobably are best reserved\\nto cases where of course\\nyour doctor prescribes them.\\nYou should always follow\\nyour doctor's advice.\\nBut in cases where\\nperhaps you are jetlagged,\\nyou're traveling\\nexcessively for any reason,\\nor working excessively,\\nyou're not getting enough sleep,\\nor your diet is radically\\nchanged from normal.\\nAnd we talked about how\\nincreasing the amount of fiber\\nin your diet might be\\nuseful for increasing\\nfiber digesting enzymes\\nand the assimilation\\nof fibrous foods\\nbut that it's really the\\ningestion of fermented foods\\nand, in fact, getting anywhere from four\\nor even up to six servings\\na day of fermented foods\\ncan be immensely beneficial for reducing\\ninflammatory markers in the body\\nand for improving microbiota diversity\\nall along the gut and\\nthereby improving signaling\\nand outcomes along the gut-brain axis.\\nSo we went all the way\\nfrom structure to function\\nto the four kinds of signaling,\\nmechanical, chemical, indirect, direct,\\nprobiotics, fiber, and fermented foods.\\nAnd I tossed in a little\\nbit at the end there also\\nabout ways that you can make\\nyour own fermented foods\\nat home in order to try and\\noffset some of the costs.\\nAlso, it's just kind of fun to do.\\nAnd some of those\\nactually taste quite good.\\nI've actually found that\\nthe fermented sauerkraut\\nthat we're making at home actually rivals\\nthe sauerkraut that you can buy\\nout of the refrigerated\\nsection at the grocery store.\\nAnd I am by no means\\na skilled cook or chef\\nand basically have no\\nculinary skill whatsoever.\\nSo if I can do it, you can do it.\\nI hope you found this information useful\\nand perhaps also actionable.\\nOne of my motivations\\nfor doing this episode\\nwas, again, as a primer for the episode\\nwith Dr. Justin Sonnenburg\\nwhere we go really deep\\ninto the gut microbiome,\\nless so into the gut-brain axis,\\nbut really deep into the gut microbiome,\\nwhat it is, what it\\ndoes, what it doesn't do,\\nand some of the emerging\\nfindings from his lab\\nthat are yet to be published.\\nAnd I also was excited to do this episode\\nbecause I think many of us have heard\\nabout the gut microbiome.\\nWe hear about these bacteria\\nthat live in our gut.\\nWe hear about the gut-brain axis\\nor that 90% or more of\\nthe serotonin that we make\\nis made in our gut.\\nWe hear about the gut as a\\nsecond brain and so forth.\\nBut I think for many people,\\nthey don't really have a clear picture\\nof what the gut microbiome is\\nand the pathways and mechanisms\\nby which it can signal\\nto the brain and to the\\nother parts of the body.\\nSo I hope that today's\\ninformation at least improved\\nthe clarity around that topic\\nand leaves you with a more vivid picture\\nof this incredible system\\nthat is our gut-brain axis.\\nIf you're enjoying and/or\\nlearning from this podcast,\\nplease subscribe to our YouTube channel.\\nThat's a

for everyday life.\\n(energetic music)\\nI'm Andrew Huberman\\nand I'm a professor of\\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\\nToday's podcast episode\\nis all about sleep,\\nand we're also going to talk about\\nthe mirror image of sleep,\\nwhich is wakefulness.\\nNow, these two phases of our life,\\nsleep and wakefulness,\\ngovern everything about our\\nmental and physical health,\\nand we're not just gonna talk about\\nwhat's useful about sleep,\\nwe're also gonna talk about\\nhow to get better at sleeping,\\nand that will include how to\\nget better at falling asleep,\\ntiming your sleep, and\\naccessing better sleep quality.\\nIn doing so, we're also gonna discuss\\nhow to get more focused\\nand alert in wakefulness,\\nso because sleep and\\nwakefulness are related,\\nwe really can't have a\\nconversation about one\\nwithout the other.\\nNow, in keeping with this theme,\\nyou may catch a few\\nsnores in the background.\\nUnlike me, my bulldog, Costello,\\ncan fall asleep anywhere, anytime,\\nand he happens to be sleeping\\nover there in the corner,\\nso if you hear snoring,\\nthat's what that's about.\\nAs always, I wanna just\\nmention that this podcast\\nis part of my effort to bring\\nzero-cost-to-consumer public education\\nabout science and science-related tools,\\nit is unrelated to my\\nteaching and research roles\\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\\nToday's podcast is brought\\nto us by Helix mattresses,\\nhaving the proper sleep environment,\\nboth the environment you're sleeping in\\nand the object you're sleeping on,\\nis critically important to\\ngetting a good night's sleep.\\nHelix mattresses are a\\nlittle different than most\\nbecause they're matched to\\nyour specific sleep needs,\\nas well as whether or not\\nyou tend to run hot or cold\\nas you sleep through the night,\\nwhat position you sleep in, and so forth,\\nso if you go to their website,\\nthey have a quiz that you can take\\nthat matches you to\\nthe particular mattress\\nthat's gonna be best for your sleep needs.\\nI've always had a lot of trouble sleeping,\\nI'm one of these people\\nthat can fall asleep easily,\\nbut then I wake up\\nand I have a hard time\\ngetting back to sleep,\\nand once I switched to a Helix mattress\\nthat was precisely\\nmatched to my sleep needs,\\nI found I could sleep through the night,\\nwhich has made a tremendous\\ndifference for me.\\nIf you wanna try Helix mattresses,\\nyou can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,\\nand that will give you up to\\n$200 off on a mattress order,\\nas well as two pillows free\\nwith your mattress order,\\nand of course, having the proper pillows\\nis just as important as\\nhaving the proper mattress.\\nToday's podcast is also\\nbrought to us by Headspace,\\nHeadspace is a meditation app\\nthat teaches you how to meditate.\\nIt's fair to say that now there's\\na ton of research out there\\nin peer-reviewed journals\\nsupporting the fact that\\nmindfulness meditation\\ncan support mental and physical health,\\nbut many people find it hard to meditate,\\nin fact, I'm one of these people.\\nI started meditating in my teens,\\nbut then I would drop\\nit every few weeks or so\\nand then I'd get back to it\\nmaybe the following week or every year,\\nI just was not very regular\\nabout my meditation practice,\\nand then a few years ago I\\nwas flying a lot for work\\nand I was on JetBlue flights,\\nand they have Headspace as\\npart of the choice of things\\nthat you can watch on the TV screen,\\nand as I started\\nmeditating more regularly,\\nwhat I found is my sleep was better,\\nI would arrive feeling more rested,\\nit was just a tremendous effects\\non my work performance and\\nother aspects of my life.\\nIf you wanna try Headspace,\\nyou can go to headspace.com/specialoffer,\\nif you do that, you'll get one month\\nof all of Headspace's\\nmeditations for free,\\nthat's the best offer right now,\\nso if interested, go to\\nheadspace.com/specialoffer.\\nSo let's talk about sleep,\\nsleep is this incredible\\nperiod of our lives\\nwhere we are not conscious.\\nWe might dream, we might\\ntwitch, we might even wake up,\\nbut in sleep, we are only in relation\\nto things that are happening\\nwithin our brain and body.\\nOutside sensory experience, in most cases,\\ncan't really impact us,\\nand yet, sleep is this tremendously\\nimportant period of life\\nbecause it resets our ability\\nto be focused, alert,\\nand emotionally stable\\nin the wakeful period,\\nso we can't really talk\\nabout wakefulness, focus,\\nmotivation, mood, wellbeing\\nwithout thinking about sleep,\\nand that's why we're\\ndevoting this entire month\\nto the discussion about sleep.\\nNow, we also can't talk about\\nsleep and think about sleep\\nwithout thinking about wakefulness\\nbecause it turns out that\\nthe period that we call sleep\\nand the period we call wakefulness\\nare tethered to one another.\\nWhat we do in the waking state\\ndetermines when we fall asleep,\\nhow quickly we fall asleep,\\nwhether or not we stay asleep,\\nand how we feel when we\\nwake up the next day,\\nand today, we're going to talk mostly\\nabout how to get better at sleeping,\\nand the reason for starting\\nthe conversation that way\\nas opposed to just diving into\\na lot of biology about sleep,\\nis because first of all,\\nthere's a lot of information\\nout there already\\nabout the biology of sleep.\\nWe're gonna touch on a little bit of this,\\nthings like stages of\\nsleep and sleep spindles,\\nmelatonin, and dreaming,\\nbut I think that by now,\\nmost people are aware\\nthat getting a really good night's sleep\\non a consistent basis\\nis critically important,\\nbut most people don't know how to do that.\\nIn fact, I'm guessing that\\nvery few of you out there\\nare consistently getting\\nseven to nine hours\\nof really terrific sleep,\\nwaking up feeling rested\\nand like you're ready to attack the day,\\nand being able to go through the day\\nfeeling focused and alert\\nwithout dips in energy or focus,\\nso if you're like most\\npeople, which includes me,\\nyou have some challenges with sleep\\nat least every third or fifth night or so\\nand maybe even more often,\\nso we're really gonna go tool-heavy today\\nand talk about tools that\\ncan help you fall asleep,\\nsleep better, and emerge from\\nsleep feeling more rested,\\nand we're gonna do that by\\ngrounding our discussion of tools\\nin peer-reviewed studies,\\nmostly from the last 10 years,\\nalthough some even more recent than that,\\nand we're gonna start by\\ndiscussing what is sleep\\nand what governs the timing\\nof the onset of sleep,\\nin other words, what makes you get sleepy\\nat a particular time of day.\\nSo what determines how well we sleep\\nand the quality of our wakeful state?\\nTurns out that's governed by two forces,\\nthe first force is a chemical force,\\nit's called adenosine.\\nAdenosine is a molecule in\\nour nervous system and body\\nthat builds up the longer we are awake,\\nso if you've just slept for 8, or 9,\\nor 10 really deep, restful hours,\\nadenosine is gonna be very\\nlow in your brain and body.\\nIf, however, you've been awake\\nfor 10, 15, or more hours,\\nadenosine levels are\\ngoing to be much higher.\\nAdenosine creates a sort of\\nsleep drive or a sleep hunger,\\nand actually, hunger is\\nthe appropriate word here\\nbecause for most of what\\nwe're gonna discuss today,\\nwe can think of it in an\\nanalogous way to nutrition.\\nYour nutrition and how well you feel\\nafter you eat certain foods,\\nyour overall level of fitness\\nand your cellular health\\nand your heart health\\nisn't governed by any one food item\\nthat you might eat or not eat,\\nit's governed by a number\\nof different factors,\\nhow often you eat, how much you eat,\\nwhich items you eat, et cetera,\\nand what works best for you.\\nIn the same way, your\\nsleep and your wakefulness\\nare the product of kind of the average\\nof a number of different behaviors,\\nhow long you've been awake is a key one\\nbecause of this molecule, adenosine.\\nSo the reason you get sleepy\\nwhen you've been up for a while\\nis because adenosine\\nis creeping up steadily\\nthe longer you've been awake,\\nand a good way to remember\\nthis and think about adenosine\\nis to think about caffeine.\\nCaffeine, for most people,\\nexcept a very small percentage of people,\\nwakes them up, it makes\\nthem feel more alert,\\nin fact, some people are\\nso sensitive to caffeine\\nthat they feel jittery if they drink it\\neven in small amounts,\\nother people can drink\\nlarge amounts of caffeine\\nand not feel jittery at all.\\nCaffeine acts as an adenosine antagonist,\\nwhat that means is that\\nwhen you ingest caffeine,\\nwhether or not it's coffee or soda or tea,\\nor in any other form,\\nit binds to the adenosine receptor,\\nit sort of parks there just like a car\\nwould park in a given parking slot,\\nand therefore, adenosine\\ncan't park in that slot.\\nNow, when caffeine parks in\\nthe adenosine receptor slot,\\nnothing really happens\\ndownstream of that receptor,\\nthe receptor can't engage\\nthe normal cellular\\nfunctions of making that cell\\nand you feel sleepy.\\nSo the reason caffeine wakes you up\\nis because it blocks\\nthe sleepiness receptor,\\nit blocks the sleepy signal,\\nand this is why when\\nthat caffeine wears off,\\nadenosine will bind to that receptor,\\nsometimes with even greater,\\nwhat we call affinity,\\nand you feel the crash,\\nyou feel especially tired.\\nNow, I'm not here to demonize\\ncaffeine, I love caffeine,\\nand I drink it in the morning\\nand I drink it in the afternoon,\\nbut I'm one of these people\\nthat, either because of my tolerance\\nor because of some genetic variations\\nthat exist among people\\nin terms of their adenosine receptors,\\nI can drink caffeine\\nas late as 4:00 or 5:00\\np.m. in the evening\\nand still fall asleep just fine.\\nSome people can't have any caffeine at all\\nor can't have any caffeine past 11:00 a.m.\\nor else their sleep is totally disrupted.\\nAll of this has to do\\nwith the relationship\\nbetween adenosine and\\nthese adenosine receptors,\\ngenetic variation,\\nthings that are very hard to\\nfind out except experimentally,\\nmeaning each of you needs to decide\\nand figure out for yourselves\\nwhether or not you can tolerate caffeine\\nand at what times of day\\nyou can tolerate caffeine\\nin order to still fall asleep\\neasily and get good sleep,\\nso rather than demonize caffeine,\\nor say that everyone can\\ndrink caffeine until late,\\nyou need to figure out\\nwhat's right for you.\\nCaffeine has a lot of health benefits,\\nit also, for some people,\\ncan be problematic for health,\\nit can raise blood pressure, et cetera,\\ncaffeine increases this molecule\\nthat's a neuromodulator\\nthat we call dopamine,\\nwe discussed this in episode one,\\nwhich tends to make us\\nfeel good, motivated,\\nand give us energy\\nbecause, as you may have\\nlearned in episode one,\\ndopamine is related to\\nanother neuromodulator\\ncalled epinephrine, which gives us energy,\\nin fact, epinephrine\\nis made from dopamine.\\nSo let's just take a step back\\nand think about what we're talking about\\nwhen we're talking about sleepiness,\\nsleepiness is driven by\\nincreases in adenosine\\nthat happen naturally,\\ncaffeine prevents the adenosine\\nfrom having its action of making us sleepy\\nby blocking that receptor,\\nso it gives us energy and it\\nincreases our dopamine levels,\\nbut some people can't\\ntolerate caffeine very well,\\nother people can tolerate it just fine,\\nso you need to determine\\nthat experimentally.\\nAll the data say there's\\ntremendous variation,\\nand right now, the only\\nway that I'm aware of\\nfor you to decide whether or not\\ncaffeine is a good or a bad thing for you,\\nand whether or not you should ingest it\\nat a given time of day or at all\\nis really to figure that out on your own,\\nin fact, there's a small subset of people\\nthat can drink caffeine until very late\\nand they have no trouble falling asleep\\nbecause they actually have a mutant form\\nof the adenosine receptor,\\nso in keeping with the theme\\nof science and science-related tools,\\nthis is one of those cases\\nwhere I can't give you a\\none-size-fits-all prescription\\nexcept to say you need to\\nexperiment with caffeine\\nin a way that's safe for you\\nand explore that and figure\\nout what works for you,\\nand then stick with that.\\nOkay, so adenosine is\\ndriving this sleep hunger,\\nwhen adenosine is low,\\nit's like we're well-fed,\\nwe're not very hungry,\\nand when adenosine is high,\\nit's like we're fasted for a long time\\nand we tend to be very hungry,\\nso that when adenosine is high,\\nwe really wanna fall asleep.\\nIf you want, I'm not suggesting\\nyou do this experiment,\\nbut you can do it,\\nyou can stay up for four more hours\\nthan you're used to staying up\\nand you'll find that\\nyou're very, very sleepy.\\nThat's because adenosine is building up\\nat levels higher and higher\\nbecause you've been awake\\nfor those extra four hours.\\nHowever, if you've ever\\npulled an all-nighter,\\nyou'll notice something interesting,\\nas morning rolls around,\\nyou'll suddenly feel an increase\\nin your energy and alertness again,\\neven though adenosine has been building up\\nfor the entire night.\\nNow, why is that?\\nThe reason that is is because\\nthere's a second force\\nwhich is governing when you\\nsleep and when you're awake,\\nand that force is a\\nso-called circadian force,\\ncircadian means about a\\nday or about 24 hours,\\nand inside all of us is a clock\\nthat exists in your brain and my brain,\\nand the brain of every\\nanimal that we're aware of,\\nthat determines when we want to be sleepy\\nand when we want to be awake.\\nJust think about it,\\nwe don't go through the day\\nwanting to fall asleep every 30 minutes\\nand then feeling like we're wide awake,\\nour sleep and our period of sleepiness\\ntends to be condensed into one block,\\ntypically one 6- to 10-hour block,\\nalthough there's also variation\\nin terms of how much people want to sleep,\\nand we're going to discuss\\nhow you can diagnose\\nyour absolute sleep need\\nas well as how to recover\\nsleep that you've lost.\\nThat block of sleep\\nand when it falls within\\neach 24-hour cycle\\nis governed by a number\\nof different things,\\nbut the most powerful thing\\nthat's governing when\\nyou want to be asleep\\nand when you want to be awake is light,\\nand in particular, it's\\ngoverned by sunlight,\\nand I can't emphasize enough\\nhow important and how\\nactionable this relationship is\\nbetween light and when you want to sleep.\\nIt's quite simple on the face of it\\nand it's quite simple to resolve,\\nbut people tend to make a big mess\\nof this whole circadian\\nliterature, frankly,\\nso let's just break it\\ndown from the standpoint\\nof what's going on in your brain and body\\nas you go through one 24-hour day.\\nLet's start with waking,\\nso regardless of how\\nwell you slept at night\\nor whether or not you were up all night,\\nmost people tend to wake up\\nsometime around when the sun rises,\\nmaybe not right at sunrise,\\nbut within an hour or two\\nor maybe three of sunrise.\\nNow, I realize there\\nare night-shift workers\\nand there are people traveling\\nand experiencing jet lag\\nwhere this is not going to be the case,\\nwe are gonna deal with\\njet lag and shift work\\nat the end of this podcast,\\nbut for most people, we tend to wake up\\nabout the time that the\\nsun is rising or so,\\nand as we do that,\\nadenosine levels tend to\\nbe low if we've been asleep\\nfor reasons that you now understand,\\nand our system generates\\nan internal signal\\nthat is in the form of a hormone.\\nNow, I've talked a lot about\\nneuromodulators and neurotransmitters,\\nI haven't talked a lot about\\nhormones yet on this podcast.\\nThe definition of a hormone\\nis it's a substance,\\na chemical that's released\\nfrom one organ in your body\\nthat goes and acts on other\\norgans elsewhere in your body,\\nincluding your nervous system.\\nWhen you wake up in the morning,\\nyou wake up because a particular\\nhormone called cortisol\\nis released from your adrenal glands,\\nyour adrenal glands sit\\nright above your kidneys,\\nand there's a little pulse of cortisol.\\nThere's also a pulse of some,\\nand when I say a pulse,\\nI just mean the release of a little bit,\\nthere's also a pulse of\\nepinephrine, which is adrenaline,\\nfrom your adrenals and also in your brain,\\nand you feel awake.\\nNow, that pulse of cortisol\\nand adrenaline and epinephrine\\nmight come from your alarm clock,\\nit might come from you\\nnaturally waking up,\\nbut it tends to alert your\\nwhole system in your body\\nthat it's time to\\nincrease your heart rate,\\nit's time to start tensing your muscles,\\nit's time to start moving about.\\nIt's very important\\nthat that cortisol pulse\\ncome early in the day,\\nor at least, early in your\\nperiod of wakefulness,\\nI say that because some people\\nare waking up at 8:00 p.m.\\nand are sleeping all day,\\nbut it's very important\\nthat that pulse of cortisol\\noccur early in the day and\\nthat it happens all at once,\\nit sort of sets a rising tide\\nof cortisol in your system.\\nNow, many of you have\\nprobably heard about cortisol\\nin relation to stress,\\nand indeed, as we go through\\nour day and our life,\\ndifferent stressors, different\\nevents happen in our life\\nthat make us feel more alert.\\nSome of the more stressful ones\\nmight be looking at your credit card bill\\nand seeing what seems to\\nbe a fraudulent charge,\\nor looking at your phone\\nand suddenly seeing a text that something\\nyou thought was gonna\\nhappen at a particular time\\nis not gonna happen,\\nor you're running late,\\nthose will tend to increase norepinephrine\\nand epinephrine and\\nadrenaline in your system,\\nand if they're severe enough,\\nyou'll start getting\\nsome pulses of cortisol\\nreleased from your adrenals\\nthroughout the day,\\nbut there's this normal,\\nhealthy rising tide of cortisol\\nthat happens early in the day,\\nand I say healthy because it wakes you up,\\nit makes you feel alert,\\nand it makes you feel able\\nto move and wanting to move\\nand to go about your day\\nfor work, for exercise,\\nfor school, for social\\nrelations, et cetera.\\nSo when you wake up in the morning\\nis when that cortisol pulse takes off,\\nand something else important happens,\\na timer is set in your body\\nand in your nervous system\\nthat dictates when a different\\nhormone called melatonin,\\nwhich makes you sleepy,\\nwill be secreted from a\\nparticular brain region,\\nso let's talk about that.\\nWhen you wake up in the morning\\nand you experience that rise in cortisol,\\nthere's a timer that starts going,\\nand these are cellular timers\\nand they're dictated by the relation\\nbetween different organs in your body,\\nthat says to your brain and body\\nthat in about 12 to 14 hours,\\na different hormone, this\\nhormone we're calling melatonin,\\nwill be released from your pineal gland.\\nSo there's two mechanisms here,\\na wakefulness signal\\nand a sleepiness signal,\\nand the wakefulness signal\\ntriggers the onset of the timer\\nfor the sleepiness signal.\\nNow, that sleepiness signal\\nthat we call melatonin\\nthat's released from the pineal\\ncomes only from the pineal.\\nUnless you're taking exogenous melatonin,\\nyou're supplementing with melatonin,\\nthe only source of melatonin in your body\\nis going to be this pineal gland,\\nso let's talk about the\\npineal gland for a second.\\nThe pineal gland is a gland\\nthat sits kind of in the\\nlittle structure near,\\nfor the aficionados out there,\\nit's kind of near the fourth ventricle,\\nit's about the size of a pea,\\nDescartes, the philosopher,\\nsaid that the pineal was\\nthe seat of the soul,\\nhe said that because it's\\none of the few structures\\nin the human brain\\nthat there's only one of them,\\nyou know, most structures,\\nthere's one on either side of the brain,\\nso-called bihemispheric,\\nbut the pineal, there's only one.\\nI don't know anything about souls, really,\\ncertainly not the science of souls,\\nbut I think it's very unlikely\\nthat the pineal is the seat of the soul,\\nbut it is a very interesting organ\\nbecause it's the only organ in our body\\nthat releases melatonin,\\nand that melatonin makes us\\nsleepy and lets us fall asleep.\\nNow, I'm guessing that many\\nof you are probably asking,\\n\\\"Should I take melatonin?\\\"\\nMy personal bias on this is,\\nexcept in rare cases, no,\\nfor the following reason,\\nmelatonin has a second function,\\nwhich is that melatonin\\nalso suppresses the onset of puberty.\\nIn kids, and especially in babies,\\nmelatonin isn't just\\nreleased in the evening\\n12 to 16 hours after we wake,\\nmelatonin is released\\nchronically, or tonically,\\nthroughout the day and night,\\nand that chronic or tonic\\nrelease of melatonin\\nis known to suppress some\\nof the other hormones\\nin other regions of the brain\\nthat trigger the onset of puberty.\\nNow, if you or your child\\nhas been taking melatonin,\\ndon't freak out,\\nas always, any kind of supplement\\nor anything that you're going\\nto take or think about taking,\\nyou really need to\\nconsult with your doctor,\\nI've said this many times on this podcast\\nand it's in the show notes, et cetera,\\nbut before you remove anything\\nor add anything to what\\nyou're already doing,\\nplease do consult with a\\nhealthcare professional.\\nHowever, melatonin is known\\nto suppress the onset of puberty,\\nso much so that regular, cyclic,\\ncycled periods of melatonin\\nrelease from the pineal\\nreally correlate with the onset of puberty\\nand early adulthood,\\nmeaning as we start secreting\\nmelatonin only at night,\\nthat's also when we tend to\\ntransition out of puberty.\\nNow, there are a lot of\\nthings that correlate\\nin our nervous system,\\nso that doesn't necessarily\\nmean it controls it,\\nbut in this case we know,\\nbased on lots of data,\\nendocrinology and so forth,\\nthat melatonin suppresses\\nthe onset of puberty,\\nso supplementing melatonin\\ncould be problematic\\nfor that reason,\\nbut if you've already\\ngone through puberty,\\nit could also have some impact\\non other hormone systems in your body,\\nso that's why I personally\\ndon't like to use\\nmelatonin to fall asleep.\\nThere's another reason,\\nwhich is that melatonin\\nwill help you fall asleep\\nbut it won't help you stay asleep,\\nand many people who take melatonin\\nfind that they wake up\\nthree to five hours later\\nunable to fall back asleep.\\nPart of the reason for that might be\\nthat melatonin purchased at,\\nyou can buy it over the counter\\nin most areas of the world\\neven though it's a hormone,\\nwhich is a little unusual,\\nyou can't just go into a\\npharmacy, at least in the US,\\nand buy testosterone or\\ncortisol or estrogen,\\nyou need a prescription,\\nbut you can go buy melatonin\\nfor whatever reason,\\nI don't know the reasons\\nfor that legality,\\nbut it's been shown many times,\\nand now I'm borrowing from some items\\nthat were in Matt Walker's\\nbook, \\\"Why We Sleep,\\\"\\nwhere he stated there is evidence\\nthat, in commercially available melatonin,\\nthe amount of melatonin has\\nbeen tested for various brands,\\nit can range anywhere from being\\n15% of what's listed on the bottle,\\nokay, so if they list\\nthis as 100 milligrams,\\nit would be a tremendously high dose,\\nit turns out it's only 15 milligrams\\nin that particular pill or capsule,\\nor up to 400 times more than\\nwhat's listed on the bottle,\\nso it's completely unregulated,\\nand so for those of you taking melatonin,\\nI will discuss at the end of the podcast\\nsome other potential alternatives\\nthat are probably safer\\nand don't have these issues.\\nSo should you take melatonin?\\nMy personal bias is no,\\nbut for many people, they\\nfind that it does help them,\\nand so if you do find it helps you,\\nthen just consider what I'm saying\\nin light of the other\\npractices that you're doing\\nand talk to your healthcare professional.\\nOkay, so the rhythm of\\ncortisol and melatonin\\nis what we call endogenous,\\nit's happening in us all the time\\nwithout any external input,\\nin fact, if we were in complete darkness,\\nliving in a cave with no\\nartificial lights whatsoever,\\nor we were in complete brightness\\nwhere we never experienced any darkness,\\nthese rhythms of cortisol\\nand melatonin would continue,\\nyou would have a bump in\\ncortisol, or a pulse in cortisol,\\nthat would drop off with time,\\nand then melatonin would come\\nup about 12 to 14 hours later,\\nbut these endogenous systems of our body,\\nwhich are both hormonal and neural,\\nwere set so that external things\\ncould govern when they happen.\\nNow, this takes us back to\\nepisode one of the podcast\\nthat if you haven't listened to already,\\nyou might wanna listen to,\\nwhere we talked about sensation\\nand perception and all that,\\nI'm not gonna review it again here,\\nbut there's one particular sensory event,\\none particular influence\\non your nervous system\\nthat determines when that cortisol\\nis going to start to rise,\\nso if you were in complete darkness,\\nit would happen once per 24-hour cycle,\\nbut it would be somewhat\\nlater and later each day,\\nwhereas under normal circumstances,\\nwhat happens is you wake up,\\nand what happens when you wake up?\\nYou open your eyes.\\nWhen your open your eyes,\\nlight comes into your eyes.\\nNow, the way this system works\\nis that you have a particular\\nset of neurons in your eye,\\nthey're called retinal ganglion cells,\\nyou don't have to remember\\nthat if you don't want to,\\nbut these retinal ganglion\\ncells are brain neurons,\\nagain, the retina is just\\nthe one piece of your brain,\\nactually, two pieces because\\nmost of you have two retinas,\\nthat resides outside the skull, per se.\\nWhen light comes into the eye,\\nthere's a particular group\\nof retinal ganglion cells,\\nor type of retinal ganglion cells,\\nthat perceives a particular type of light\\nand communicates that to this clock\\nthat resides right above\\nthe roof of your mouth\\ncalled the suprachiasmatic nucleus, okay?\\nSo I know this can get\\na little complicated,\\nbut these retinal ganglion cells,\\nwhen you open your eyes, light comes in,\\nand an electrical signal is\\nsent to this central clock\\nwe call the suprachiasmatic nucleus,\\nand the suprachiasmatic\\nnucleus has connections\\nwith essentially every cell\\nand organ of your body.\\nNow, it's vitally important\\nthat we get light communicated\\nto this central clock\\nin order to time the cortisol\\nand melatonin properly,\\nand when I say properly, I\\ncan say that with confidence\\nbecause we know based on a lot of evidence\\nthat if you don't get\\nyour cortisol and melatonin rhythms right,\\nthere are tremendously\\nbroad and bad effects\\non cardiovascular health,\\ndementia, metabolic effects,\\nlearning, depression, dementia,\\nin fact, there're so many negative effects\\nassociated with getting this wrong\\nthat I don't wanna get\\ninto it in too much detail,\\nin fact, I feel like we've been bombarded\\nwith all this information about\\nhow we're not sleeping well,\\nwe're not sleeping at the right times,\\nwe're not sleeping enough,\\nto the point where people\\nnow have sleep anxiety,\\nif they can't sleep well for a night,\\nthey're feeling overwhelmed by that\\nand it's sort of now they're stressed\\nabout not being able to sleep\\nwhich is making it harder\\nto sleep, et cetera.\\nI really wanna focus on what we can do\\nto anchor these systems properly,\\nso let's think about what\\nhappens when we do this correctly\\nand how to do it correctly.\\nWhen we wake up, our eyes open,\\nnow, if we're in a dark room,\\nthere isn't enough light to\\ntrigger the correct timing\\nof this cortisol-melatonin\\nthing, these rhythms.\\nYou might say, \\\"Well, why\\nwon't any light do it?\\\"\\nWell, it turns out that\\nthese neurons in our eye\\nthat set the circadian clock\\nand then allow our circadian\\nclock to set all the clocks\\nof all the cells and organs\\nand tissues of our body\\nresponds best to a\\nparticular quality of light\\nand amount of light,\\nand those are the qualities\\nof light and amount of light\\nthat come from sunlight,\\nso these neurons, what\\nthey're really looking for,\\nalthough they don't have\\na mind of their own,\\nis the sun at what we\\ncall low solar angle,\\nthe eye and the nervous system\\ndon't know anything about\\nsunrises or sunsets,\\nit only knows the quality of light\\nthat comes in when the\\nsun is low in the sky,\\nthe system evolved so that\\nwhen the sun is low in the sky,\\nthere's a particular contrast\\nbetween yellows and blues\\nthat triggers the\\nactivation of these cells,\\nso if you wake up and\\nyou look at your phone\\nor your computer,\\nor you flip on a bunch\\nof artificial lights,\\nwill these cells be activated?\\nAnd the answer is, sort of,\\nthey'll be activated but\\nnot in the optimal way.\\nWhat you want to do is\\nget sunlight in your eyes\\nas close to waking as possible.\\nNow, I wanna be really clear about this\\nbecause I've talked about it\\non other podcasts when I was a guest\\nand I talked about it\\non my Instagram feed,\\nand there seemed to be the same questions\\ncoming up again and again,\\nthese neurons don't know sunlight, per se,\\nthey don't know sunrise or\\nsunset, for that matter,\\nthey don't know artificial\\nlight from sunlight,\\nwhat they respond best to,\\nhowever, is the quality\\nand amount of light\\nthat comes in when the\\nsun is low in the sky,\\nthat means that if you can\\nwatch the sunrise, great,\\nthat's perfect for triggering\\nactivation of these cells,\\nhowever, if you wake up a\\nfew hours after the sunrise,\\nwhich I tend to most days, personally,\\nyou still wanna get\\noutside and view sunlight,\\nyou don't need the sunlight\\nbeaming you directly in the eyes,\\nthere's a lot of photons, light energy,\\nthat's scattered from\\nsunlight at this time,\\nbut the key is to get that light energy,\\nfrom sunlight, ideally, into your eyes.\\nNow, I know many of\\nyou are already asking,\\n\\\"Well, I live in Scandinavia,\\\"\\nor, \\\"I can't get sunlight,\\n\\\"there's buildings around me,\\\" et cetera,\\nwe will get to all of that,\\nbut it's critically important\\nthat you get outside to get this light.\\nI had a discussion with\\na colleague of mine,\\nDr. Jamie Zeitzer, who's in\\nthe Department of Psychiatry\\nand Behavioral Sciences at Stanford,\\na world expert in this,\\nand he tells me that it's\\n50 times less effective\\nto view this sunlight through a window,\\nthrough a car windshield,\\nor through the side window of a car\\nthan it is to just get\\noutside with no sunglasses\\nand view light early in the day.\\nNow, if you can't see the sunrise,\\nlike I said, you can see this\\nwithin an hour or two of sunrise,\\nbut it has to be low solar angle,\\nonce the sun is overhead,\\nthe quality of light shifts\\nso that you miss this opportunity\\nto time the cortisol pulse,\\nand that turns out to\\nbe a bad thing to do,\\nyou really wanna time that\\ncortisol pulse properly\\nbecause, we'll get into this\\na little bit more later,\\nbut a late-shifted cortisol pulse,\\nin particular, a 9:00 p.m. or\\n8:00 p.m. increase in cortisol\\nis one of the consequences,\\nand maybe one of the causes,\\nof a lot of anxiety\\ndisorders and depression,\\nso it's kind of a chicken-egg thing,\\nwe don't know whether or\\nnot it's correlated with,\\nit's the cause, or the effect,\\nbut it's a signature of\\ndepression and anxiety disorder.\\nBringing that cortisol pulse\\nearlier in your wakeful period,\\nearlier in your day,\\nhas positive benefits\\nranging from blood pressure\\nto mental health, et cetera,\\nnot gonna list them all off\\nbecause there's just so many of them,\\nbut many, many positive things happen\\nwhen you are getting the\\ncortisol early in the day\\nfar away from your melatonin pulse.\\nOkay, so how long should you be outside?\\nWell, this is gonna vary tremendously\\nbecause some people live in environments\\nwhere it's very bright,\\nso let's say it's Colorado\\nin the middle of winter,\\nthere's a snowfield,\\nthere's no cloud cover,\\nand you walk outside,\\nthere's going to be so\\nmuch photon light energy\\narriving on your retina\\nthat it probably only\\ntakes 30 to 60 seconds\\nto trigger the central clock\\nand set your cortisol and\\nmelatonin rhythms properly\\nand get everything lined up nicely,\\nwhereas if you're in Scandinavia\\nin the depths of winter\\nand you wake up at 5:00 a.m.\\nand the sun is just barely\\ncreeping across the horizon\\nand then goes back down\\nagain a few hours later,\\nyou probably are not\\ngetting enough sunlight\\nin order to set these rhythms,\\nso many people find that they need to use\\nsunlight simulators in the\\nform of particular lights\\nthat were designed to simulate sunlight,\\nhowever, and I'm not out to attack\\nthe companies that produce those,\\nthere's another solution to that,\\nyou can simply go outside for longer,\\neven if there's a lot\\nof dense cloud cover,\\nyou're probably getting anywhere\\nfrom 10,000 to 50,000 lux,\\nL-U-X, which is just a\\nmeasure of light energy,\\nand that should be sufficient\\nto set the circadian clock.\\nYou could say, \\\"Well, the\\nlights in my house or my phone\\n\\\"are really, really bright, right?\\n\\\"Everyone's telling us to\\nstay off our phones at night\\n\\\"because they're really bright,\\\"\\nbut guess what, it turns\\nout that early in the day,\\nyour retina is not very sensitive,\\nwhich means you need a lot of photons,\\nideally coming from sunlight,\\nto set these clock mechanisms,\\nso looking at your phone or\\nartificial lights is fine\\nif you wake up before sunrise,\\nbut it's not going to work to\\nset these clock mechanisms,\\nand this is supported by\\ndozens, if not hundreds,\\nof quality peer-reviewed studies,\\nso you wanna use sunlight,\\nif you can't see sunlight\\nbecause of your environment,\\nthen you are going to have\\nto opt for artificial light,\\nand in that case, you're going\\nto want an artificial light\\nthat either simulates sunlight\\nor has a lot of blue light.\\nNow, without going off course here,\\nyou might be saying,\\n\\\"Wait, I've heard blue\\nlight is bad for me.\\\"\\nActually, blue light is\\ngreat for this mechanism\\nduring the day,\\nwe can talk about blue\\nlight and blue blockers,\\nbut you really want a lot\\nof blue and yellow light\\narriving on the retina early in the day.\\nLet me be clear about something,\\nyou never ever want to look at any light,\\nsunlight or artificial light,\\nthat is painful to look at.\\nIf you find that your eyes are watering\\nor you're having challenges maintaining,\\nyou know, looking at\\nthis thing for a while\\nbecause it's painful,\\nthat light is too bright\\nand you do not wanna damage your retina,\\nso you don't wanna gaze at\\nthe sun refusing to blink\\nand burn your retina, that's\\nactually possible to do,\\nyou don't wanna do that.\\nYou have a proper blink reflex\\ninstalled in you since birth,\\nand if you feel like\\nsomething's too bright\\nand you need to blink,\\nit means you need to blink,\\nthat it's too much light,\\nso please don't beam your\\neyes with really bright light,\\nbut blue light,\\nin particular, blue light and yellow light\\ncoming from sunlight is ideal,\\nif you're going to get\\nit from artificial light\\nbecause you can't get enough sunlight,\\nwell, then, artificial lights\\nthat are rich in blue, blue wavelengths,\\nare going to be ideal for\\nsetting this mechanism.\\nA lot of people will say, \\\"Oh, I should be\\n\\\"wearing blue blockers\\nthroughout the day.\\\"\\nNo, that's the exact wrong thing,\\nif you're going to use blue blockers,\\nwe can talk about that,\\nthat should be reserved\\nfor late in the evening\\nbecause light suppresses melatonin.\\nI've been asked many times\\nbefore about this pineal gland\\nand there are a lot of ancient practices\\nthat map to some of the\\nthings that I'm saying,\\nand people will always say,\\n\\\"Oh, I heard that sunlight\\n\\\"is great for the pineal.\\\"\\nWell, perhaps, but we have\\nto careful about that phrase,\\nsunlight inhibits the pineal,\\nit prevents it from releasing melatonin,\\ndarkness allows the pineal\\nto release melatonin,\\nso the pineal is not the gland\\nor the organ of sunlight,\\nit is the gland of darkness,\\nin fact, melatonin can be\\nthought of as a sleepiness signal\\nthat's correlated with darkness,\\nso get up each morning,\\ntry and get outside,\\nI know that can be challenging for people,\\nbut anywhere from 2 to 10\\nminutes of sunlight exposure\\nis going to work well for most people,\\nand you wanna do this on a regular basis\\nand you don't have to do\\nit exactly at sunrise,\\nI realize I'm repeating myself,\\nbut somehow, despite\\nbarking at people about this\\nfor a couple years now,\\nI keep getting the same questions,\\nand somehow, it hasn't been sinking in,\\nwhich could be related to\\nsome circadian disorder,\\nI'm just kidding, if it's not sinking in,\\nit's probably that I'm not being effective\\nin communicating the information,\\nbut get that bright light\\nearly in the day from sunlight,\\nand if you can't get it from sunlight,\\nget it from artificial light.\\nWhat kinds of artificial lights will work?\\nWell, there are these sunrise simulators,\\nbut the ring lights that\\npeople use for selfies\\nand this sort of thing,\\nfor posting on Instagram,\\nthose generate a lot of blue light.\\nIf wanna get experimental about this,\\nthere's a free app, I have\\nno relationship to the app,\\nbut it's a great app called Light Meter\\nthat you can use your phone\\nand you can measure the\\namount of photon energy\\nin your environment,\\nand it's kind of a fun experiment to do,\\nyou can go outside in the morning\\nand you'll see that\\nthere's 10,000, 20,000 lux,\\neven though it might\\nseem like it's kinda dim\\nor there's tree cover or cloud cover,\\nyou go inside and you\\nshine an artificial light\\nat your phone,\\npress the button on Light Meter\\nand you'll find that it's\\nonly 500 or 1,000 lux,\\nand you realize that even\\nthough it seems really bright,\\nthe artificial light is very condensed,\\nwhereas the outside light is\\nscattered in the atmosphere,\\nand so you can think that\\nyou're not getting much sunlight\\nbut you're actually\\ngetting much more outside,\\nso get outside, get that\\nsunlight early in the day,\\nand try and do it on a consistent basis.\\nIf you can't do it every day\\nor you sleep through this\\nperiod of the early day,\\nlow solar angle,\\ndon't worry about it,\\nthese systems in the body,\\nthese hormone systems and\\nneurotransmitter systems\\nthat make you awake at\\ncertain periods of the day\\nand sleepy at other times\\nare operating by averaging\\nwhen you view the brightest light.\\nNow, that can immediately tell us\\nthat what most people\\nare doing is terrible,\\nthey're waking up and they're\\nlooking at their phone,\\nwhich isn't triggering activation\\nof these cells in the eye\\nand the central circadian clock,\\nthen a few hours later,\\nthey might get in their car\\nwith sunglasses and drive.\\nNow, a note about sunglasses\\nand prescription lenses,\\nabsolutely never, ever,\\never compromise safety\\nfor the sorts of things I'm talking about,\\nso if you need to wear\\nsunglasses for safety reasons,\\nwear them,\\nabsolutely, if you wear\\nprescription lenses or contacts,\\nwear them, they won't filter\\nout the wavelengths of light\\nthat are necessary for\\nsetting these central clocks,\\nso safety first, of course,\\nif you have a retinal\\ndegenerative disorder,\\nretinitis pigmentosa, macular\\ndegeneration, or glaucoma,\\nor those run in your family,\\nyou want to avoid excessively\\nbright light all the time,\\nyou wanna be very cautious about that,\\nyou're going to wanna\\nget your light exposure\\nthrough seeing dimmer\\nlight, including sunlight,\\nbut for longer periods of time, perhaps.\\nYou might immediately ask,\\n\\\"What about low-vision or blind people,\\n\\\"how do they set these central clocks?\\\"\\nWell, turns out that\\nlow-vision and blind people,\\nmost of them, provided\\nthey still have eyes,\\nthat the eyes weren't removed\\nbecause of a burn or a tumor\\nor something like that,\\nstill maintain these neurons\\nthat set the circadian clock,\\nwhich brings me to a\\nreally important point,\\nit's not about seeing\\nand perceiving the sun,\\nthis is a subconscious mechanism\\nby which these neurons,\\nwhich are called\\nmelanopsin ganglion cells,\\nthese neurons set your central clocks\\nby getting activated by the\\nparticular wavelengths of light\\nthat are present in the atmosphere,\\neven coming through cloud cover,\\nand you don't need to\\nsee or perceive the sun\\nin order to get this mechanism to start.\\nNow, it's such a vitally\\nimportant mechanism\\nbecause it dictates how well\\nand what time you will want to\\nfall asleep later in the day,\\nso for those of you that are night owls\\nand you insist that you're a night owl\\nand you have the genetic polymorphism\\nthat makes you a night owl,\\nyou may very well have\\nthat genetic polymorphism,\\nthose genes that make\\nyou want to stay up late\\nand wake up late,\\nbut chances are, about half of you\\nthat think that you're night owls\\nare just not getting enough\\nsunlight early in the day.\\nSo viewing light early in\\nthe day, ideally sunlight,\\nis key for establishing\\nhealthy sleep-wake rhythms\\nand for allowing you to\\nfall asleep easily at night.\\nNow, it's not gonna make sure\\nthat all that happens every single time,\\nbut it is the foundation of proper sleep\\nand what we call circadian health,\\nit governs metabolism\\nand so many other things\\nthat are supposed to exist\\non a regular 24-hour cycle.\\nSome of you, many of you, might be asking,\\n\\\"What else can help set this rhythm?\\\"\\nWell, it turns out that light\\nis what we call the primary\\nzeitgeber, the time giver,\\nbut other things can help\\nestablish this rhythm of cortisol\\nfollowed by melatonin 12\\nto 16 hours later as well.\\nThe other things besides light\\nare timing of food intake,\\ntiming of exercise,\\nas well as various drugs or\\nchemicals that one might ingest,\\nnot illegal drugs,\\nalthough those will impact\\ncircadian mechanisms as well,\\nbut the reason we focus\\nso heavily on light\\nis that light is the main\\nway that this central clock,\\nthe suprachiasmatic nucleus,\\nwas supposed to be set,\\nand we know that because\\nit's the only direct input\\nto the clock.\\nThese neurons in the eye that\\nare also part of the brain\\nthat we call melanopsin ganglion cells\\nthat, not so incidentally, were discovered\\nby my friend and colleague David\\nBerson at Brown University,\\nand others, Samer Hattar,\\nKing-Wai Yau, et cetera,\\nworked out the mechanisms,\\nthe molecular mechanisms,\\nbut it was really David Berson\\nthat discovered these\\nincredibly fascinating,\\nyou know, these are cells that\\naren't important for sight\\nlike pattern vision,\\nbut are for setting our clocks,\\nDavid's really credited\\nwith making that discovery.\\nThose cells are the main way\\nand the only direct way to set the clock,\\nin fact, it's fair to say\\nthat light viewed by\\nthese melanopsin cells,\\nin particular, sunlight,\\nis 1,000 to 10,000 times more effective\\nthan, say, getting up in\\ndarkness and just exercising.\\nThat doesn't mean that you shouldn't\\nexercise early in the day in darkness\\nif that's what you like to do,\\nit will have somewhat an effect\\non raising your wakefulness\\nearly in the day\\nand setting these rhythms,\\nand this is because of\\nsome other pathways,\\nfor the aficionados out there\\nwho wanna know more neuroscience,\\nhere's how it goes, you've got this clock\\nabove the roof of your mouth\\nthat churns out this 24-hour rhythm\\nand it's communicated\\nto all the other organs\\nand tissues of your body,\\nbut there's another structure,\\nit has a cool name, it's called\\nthe intergeniculate leaflet,\\nwhich sits a few millimeters\\naway in the brain,\\nand it's involved in\\nregulating the clock output\\nthrough what's called non-photic,\\nnon-light-type influences\\nlike exercise and feeding, et cetera.\\nSo if you are not feeling\\nawake during the day\\nand you're having trouble sleeping,\\nget the sunlight exposure\\nthat we just talked about,\\nbut in addition to that,\\nif you wanna become an\\nearly riser, for instance,\\nand you wanna feel more awake\\nduring the early part of the day,\\nby getting that light exposure\\nand exercising early in the day,\\nyou will, after two or three days,\\nyou will naturally start to\\nwake up earlier in the day,\\nand that's because these\\nclock mechanisms have shifted,\\nit's like setting the clock earlier\\nas opposed to delaying the clock,\\nand that takes us to a\\nsomewhat complicated,\\nbut very important, aspect to all this,\\nwhich is, what sets the\\nclock and keeps it anchored?\\nThe main thing is that bright\\nlight early in the day,\\nthe other thing is sunset,\\nwhen the sun is also at low solar angle,\\nlow, close to the horizon,\\nby viewing sunlight at that\\ntime of day in the evening,\\nor afternoon, depending\\non what time of year it is\\nand where you are in the world,\\nthese melanopsin cells,\\nthese neurons in your eye,\\nsignal the central circadian clock\\nthat it's the end of the day,\\nand there's a really nice study\\nthat was published last year,\\nand I will put links to\\nthese references on a website\\nnot too long from now,\\nthere was a really nice study that showed\\nthat viewing sunlight around\\nthe time of the sunset,\\ndoesn't have to be just\\ncrossing the horizon,\\nbut circa sunset,\\nwithin an hour or so of sunset,\\nprevents some of the bad effects of light\\nin preventing melatonin\\nrelease later that same night,\\nso let me repeat this,\\nviewing light early in the day is key,\\nviewing light later in the day\\nwhen the sun is setting,\\nor around that time,\\ncan help protect these\\nmechanisms, your brain and body,\\nagainst the negative effects\\nof light later in the day,\\nso let me talk about you would do that,\\nyou'd go view the sunset\\nor you would go outside in\\nthe late afternoon or evening,\\nagain, if you safely can do that\\nwith sunglasses off, you will,\\nif you need to wear sunglasses, fine,\\nbut it will take probably\\n100 to 1,000 times longer\\nwith dark sunglasses than\\nif you take them off,\\nagain, if you wanna do this\\nthrough a window at work,\\nthat's fine, but it'll\\ntake 50 times longer,\\nso the best thing to do is\\njust to get outside for a few minutes,\\nanywhere from 2 to 10 minutes,\\nalso in the afternoon.\\nHaving those two signals\\narriving to your central clock\\nthat your body, your internal world,\\nknows when it's morning and\\nknows when it's evening,\\nis tremendously powerful.\\nMaybe think about it this way,\\nevery cell in your body\\nneeds glucose and energy,\\nit needs, whether or not\\nit gets that from meats\\nor it gets it from ketones or\\nit gets it from carbohydrates\\nor fruit or vegetables, it doesn't matter,\\nit is eventually converted\\ninto a certain form of energy\\nthat all your cells use,\\nbut you don't take glucose,\\nyou don't take bread or\\na steak or a nice orange\\nand shove it in your ear,\\nyou put it in your mouth,\\nit goes into your stomach, it's digested,\\nand then that resource is distributed\\nto all the cells of your body.\\nEvery cell in your body needs oxygen,\\nand you don't put a hose\\nyou know, through your\\nnostril or through your ear\\nor through some other\\norifice in your body,\\nyou inhale air and it's then\\ndistributed via the lungs\\nto the cells in your blood stream,\\nand then it's distributed to\\nall the organs of your body.\\nEvery cell and organ in your\\nbody needs light information,\\nand the way to get that light information\\nto all those cells,\\nbecause you have a thick skull\\nand the inside of you is\\ndark inside your skin,\\nthere's no sunlight getting in there,\\nis by viewing sunlight with your eyes\\nat the two times of day\\nthat I'm referring to, okay?\\nThat's the only route.\\nThere was a study published in \\\"Science,\\\"\\nan excellent journal,\\nwell over 10 years ago,\\nthat showed that light shone\\non the back of the knee\\ncould set these circadian rhythms,\\nthat study was retracted,\\nand unfortunately, most people don't know\\nthat it was retracted,\\nthere were some experimental flaws,\\nthat people were actually viewing light\\nthrough their eyes.\\nThat study was repeated,\\nturns out, there is no\\nextraocular photo reception in humans.\\nWhatever somebody tells you\\nthat light to the skin\\nor light to the wherever\\nis beneficial for your health,\\nwe can talk about that,\\nbut there's no way that light information\\nis setting your clocks,\\nyou need these cells in your eyes\\nto perceive or to see light\\nat the particular times of\\nday that I'm referring to.\\nSome animals, like snakes\\nand other reptiles,\\nactually have a hole in\\nthe top of their skull\\nto get light information\\ndirectly to their pineal\\nto suppress melatonin.\\nWe don't have that hole,\\nI mean, most of you don't\\nhave holes in your skull.\\nThese holes in your skull\\nthat we call the sockets for the eyes\\nare actually there primarily\\nto allow light information\\nto this central clock,\\nand then vision and pattern\\nvision and color vision\\ncame much later in evolution,\\nwe know this on the\\nbasis of genetic studies\\nwe get to discuss in a future podcast.\\nSo get that light information\\nto the cells of your brain and body\\nby viewing sunlight at\\nthe two times of day\\nthat I referred to.\\nThere's always a lot of questions about,\\n\\\"How long, how much, how do\\nI know if I've had enough?\\\"\\nYou'll know because your rhythm\\nwill start to fall into\\nsome degree of normalcy,\\nyou'll start to wake up\\nat more or less the same time each day,\\nyou'll fall asleep more easily at night,\\ngenerally, it takes\\nabout two or three days\\nfor these systems to align,\\nso if you've not been\\ndoing these behaviors,\\nit's gonna take a few days,\\nbut they can have tremendous benefits,\\nand sometimes rather quickly,\\non a number of different\\nmental and physical aspects\\nof your health.\\nNow let's talk about\\nthe bad effects of light\\nbecause light is not supposed\\nto arrive in our system\\nat any time,\\nand nowadays, because of\\nscreens and artificial light,\\nwe have access to light\\nat times of day and night\\nthat normally we wouldn't.\\nNow, earlier I said that\\nyou need a lot of light,\\nin particular, sunlight,\\nto set these clock mechanisms,\\nthat's true, but there's a\\nkind of diabolical feature\\nto the way all of this works,\\nwhich is the longer you've been awake,\\nthe more sensitive your retina\\nand these cells are to light,\\nso that if you've been\\nawake for 10, 12, 14 hours,\\nit becomes very easy for\\neven a small amount of light\\ncoming from a screen or\\nfrom an overhead light\\nto trigger the activation of the clock\\nand make you feel like\\nyou wanna stay up later,\\nmake it harder to fall asleep,\\nand disrupt your sleep pattern, okay?\\nSo the simple way to think about this is\\nyou want as much light\\nas is safely possible\\nearly in the day, morning\\nand throughout the day,\\nincluding blue light,\\nso take those blue\\nblockers off during the day\\nunless you have a real issue\\nwith screen light sensitivity,\\nand you want as little\\nlight coming into your eyes,\\nartificial or sunlight,\\nafter, say, 8:00 p.m.,\\nand certainly, you do not want to get\\nbright light exposure to your eyes\\nbetween 11:00 p.m. and\\n4:00 a.m., and here's why,\\nDavid Berson, who I mentioned before,\\nand another and friend and\\ncolleague, Samer Hattar,\\nwho's director of the chronobiology unit\\nat the National Institutes\\nof Mental Health\\npublished a paper in\\n\\\"Cell,\\\" which is a journal,\\nanother excellent journal,\\nvery high stringency,\\nshowing that light that\\narrives to the eyes\\nbetween 11:00 p.m. and\\n4:00 a.m., approximately,\\nsuppresses the release of dopamine,\\nthis neuromodulator\\nthat makes us feel good,\\nand it's sort of an\\nendogenous antidepressant,\\nand can inhibit learning\\nand create all sorts of\\nother detrimental effects,\\nit does this through a mechanism,\\nfor those of you that wanna\\nknow the neural pathways,\\nthat involves light to the eyes\\nthat's then signaled to a\\nstructure called the habenula,\\nthe habenula looks like\\ntwo little bat ears\\nsitting right in the middle\\nof a structure in your brain\\ncalled the thalamus,\\ndon't worry about these names\\nif you're not interested in this stuff,\\nif you are, these are\\njust avenues to explore,\\nwhen that habenula gets activated\\nit's actually called the\\ndisappointment nucleus\\nbecause it actually\\nmakes us feel less happy\\nand more disappointed,\\nand can lead to certain\\nforms of depression\\nin the wakeful state.\\nNow, if you wake up in\\nthe middle of the night\\nand you need to use the bathroom\\nor you're on an all-night flight\\nand you're, you know, need to\\nread or whatever it is, fine,\\nevery once in a while,\\nit's not gonna be a problem\\nto get bright light exposure to your eyes\\nin the middle of the night,\\nbut if you think about\\nour lifestyle nowadays\\nand being up late looking at phones,\\neven if you dim that screen,\\nyou're triggering this activation\\nbecause your retinal sensitivity\\nand the sensitivity of\\nthese neurons has gone up\\nlate in the day.\\nNow, I'm not here to dictate\\nwhat you should or shouldn't do,\\nbut for those of you that are\\nexperiencing challenges with mood,\\nthose of you that have anxiety,\\nlearning problems, issues focusing,\\nthe questions I usually get\\nare, \\\"How can I focus better?\\\"\\nWell, we will get to that,\\nbut one of the best ways you can support\\nyour mechanisms for good\\nmood, mental health,\\nlearning, focus, metabolism, et cetera,\\nis to take control of this\\nlight exposure behavior at night\\nand not get much or any\\nbright light exposure\\nin the middle of the night.\\nRed light won't trigger this pathway,\\nbut very few people have\\nthe kind of infrared lights\\nthat are set up, or floor lights,\\nand that brings me to an important point,\\nwhich is about the location of light,\\nthis hasn't been discussed\\nmuch out there, I don't think,\\nthese cells in our eye,\\nthese neurons that\\nsignal the central clock,\\nreside mostly, not\\nexclusively, but mostly,\\nin the bottom half of our retina,\\nand because we have a lens\\nin front of our retina,\\nand because of the optics of lenses,\\nthat means that these cells\\nare actually viewing\\nour upper visual field,\\nthere's an inversion of the\\nvisual image, et cetera,\\nyou can look that up\\nif you wanna learn more\\nabout retinal optics, it's fascinating,\\nbut not the topic for today.\\nThese cells are in the bottom\\nhalf of your retina mostly,\\nand so they're viewing the\\noverhead visual space around you.\\nThis is probably not\\ncoincidental that these cells\\nwere essentially designed\\nto detect sunlight,\\nwhich is overhead, of course,\\nso if you want to avoid\\nimproper activation of these neurons,\\nit's better to place lights\\nthat you use in the evening\\nlow in your physical environment,\\nso on desktops or even the\\nfloor, if you wanna go that way,\\nas opposed to overhead lights,\\nso overhead florescent\\nlights would be the worst,\\nthat would be the worst case scenario,\\nlights that are overhead\\nthat are a little bit softer,\\nof the sort or yellow or reddish tints,\\nwould be slightly better,\\nbut dim lights that\\nare set low in the room\\nare going to be best\\nbecause they aren't going\\nto activate these neurons\\nand therefore shift your circadian clock,\\nso that's a goal.\\nSome people, like Samer Hattar\\nthat I mentioned earlier,\\nhe turns his home basically\\ninto a cave in the evenings.\\nCandlelight actually does not\\ntrigger activation of these cells,\\nso candlelight and fireplaces\\nand campfires are fine,\\ndim lights, very dim lights are fine,\\nand lights low in the\\nphysical environment,\\nof course, the problem with\\ncandlelight and fireplaces\\nis the fire hazard,\\nbut you're smart people, you\\nknow what to do about that.\\nDon't burn down whatever\\nstructure you're in,\\nincluding forests, please.\\nSo, keep the lights low\\nin in your environment.\\nWhat if you wake up in\\nthe middle of the night\\nand you find yourself watching\\nTV or on the computer?\\nWell, in that case, you might\\nwanna wear blue blockers,\\nand you certainly would\\nwanna dim the screen,\\nbut ideally, you're not doing that,\\nit's remarkable the positive effects\\nof getting that bit of\\nsunlight early in the day,\\nmaybe even also around sunset,\\nand avoiding bright lights,\\nand especially overhead bright lights,\\nbetween about 11:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m..\\nNow, I'm not talking about shift work,\\nI'm realizing that we're probably\\ngonna have to have an entire discussion\\ndevoted just to shift workers\\nbecause there's some\\ngood information there\\nabout how they can protect themselves\\nagainst some of the very bad\\nhealth effects of shift work,\\nof getting light in the\\nmiddle of the night,\\nbut we rely on shift workers\\nand they're super important to culture\\nand society and the economy,\\nso I wanna acknowledge them\\nand let you know that\\nwe will do a discussion\\nabout shift work and jet lag,\\nbut let's talk about what light can do\\nin terms of shifting us in healthy ways.\\nSo the way to think\\nabout this whole system,\\nagain, is you've got adenosine building up\\ndepending on how long you've been awake\\nand it's making you sleepy,\\nand then you've got the\\ncircadian mechanisms\\nthat are timing your wakefulness\\nand timing when you wanna be asleep,\\nmainly through cortisol and melatonin,\\nbut there are a bunch of other things\\nthat are downstream of\\ncortisol and melatonin,\\nlike, we tend to be hungrier\\nduring our wakeful period\\nthan late at night,\\nsome people like to eat late at night,\\nbut if you're finding that you\\ncan't become a day person\\nor a morning person,\\nshifting your light exposure, exercise,\\nand food intake to the daytime will help.\\nSome people like to stop\\neating around 6:00 or 8:00 p.m.\\nbecause of metabolic reasons\\nor they're trying to maintain\\ntheir weight or lose weight,\\nthat's actually not supported\\nso well by the literature,\\nthe literature around\\nnutrition essentially says\\nthat it's best to restrict your feeding\\nto a certain period of each 24-hour cycle\\nto not be eating around the clock,\\nand whether or not that's 4\\nhours or 8 hours or 16 hours\\nis a much lengthier discussion\\nthan we have time for now,\\nI would refer you to Satchin Panda's book,\\n\\\"The Circadian Code,\\\"\\nwhich talks all about that,\\nhe's an expert, a former colleague of mine\\nfrom the Salk Institute in San Diego,\\nyou can explore intermittent\\nand circadian fasting,\\nso to speak, through Satchin's literature,\\nwe'll talk about that,\\nwe might even get Satchin\\nin here if we're lucky\\nat some point in the future,\\nbut you can actually use\\nlight to wake up earlier.\\nJamie Zeitzer and colleagues\\ndid a beautiful study\\nshowing that, if you turn on\\nthe lights before waking up,\\nso around 45 minutes to\\nan hour before waking up,\\neven if your eyelids are closed,\\nprovided you're not under the covers,\\nafter doing that for a few days,\\nthat increases your total sleep time\\nand shifts forward the time\\nat which you feel sleepy,\\nit makes you want to go\\nto bed earlier each night.\\nNow, in a kind of diabolical way,\\nthey did this with teenagers\\nwho are notorious for\\nwanting to wake up late\\nand stay up late,\\nand what they found was\\nbright light flashes,\\njust turning on the lights\\nin their environment, overhead lights,\\nbecause they're trying\\nto activate this system\\nand that's why they're\\nusing overhead lights,\\neven through the eyelids,\\nbefore these kids woke up,\\nthen made those kids naturally\\nwanna go to bed earlier\\nand they ended up sleeping longer,\\nso that's something you could try,\\nyou could put your lights on a timer\\nto go on early in the\\nday before you wake up,\\nyou could open your blinds\\nso that sunlight is coming through,\\nand again, if you curl\\nup under the covers,\\nthen it's not gonna reach these neurons,\\nbut it's remarkable that light\\ncan actually penetrate the eyelids,\\nactivate these neurons, and\\ngo to the central clock.\\nThat study illustrates a\\nreally important principle\\nof how you're built,\\nwhich is, you have the capacity\\nfor what are called phase\\nadvances and phase delays,\\nand I don't wanna\\ncomplicate this too much,\\nso the simplest way to think about\\nphase advances and phase delays\\nis that if you see light late in the day,\\nand in particular, in\\nthe middle of the night,\\nyour brain and body, for\\nreasons that now you understand,\\nwill think that that's morning light\\neven though it's not sunlight\\nbecause you have this\\nheightened sensitivity,\\nand it will phase delay,\\nit will delay your clock,\\nit will essentially make\\nyou want to get up later\\nand go to sleep later,\\nso if you get light exposure\\ntoo late in the evening\\nor in the middle of the night,\\nit's going to make it hard\\nto want to wake up that next morning early\\nand to go to bed early.\\nThe opposite is also true,\\nif you wake up early,\\nsay, 6:00 a.m. or 7:00 a.m.,\\nand get light exposure,\\nor even earlier, 4:00 a.m.,\\nand get light exposure,\\nit will phase-advance your clock, okay?\\nIt's gonna make your\\nclock think it's earlier\\nand you'll wanna wake up earlier,\\nso the simple way to think about this\\nis if you're having\\ntrouble waking up early\\nand feeling alert early in the day,\\nyou're going to wanna try\\nand get bright light exposure\\neven before waking up because\\nit will advance your clock,\\nit's sort of like turning\\nthe clock forward,\\nwhereas if you are having\\ntrouble waking up early,\\nyou definitely don't want to get\\ntoo much light exposure\\nor any light exposure\\nto your eyes late in the evening\\nand in the middle of the night\\nbecause it's just gonna delay\\nyour clock more and more,\\nso rather than get into the specifics\\nof everybody's situation\\nbecause there are many of you out there\\nwith different situations\\nand lifestyle requirements, et cetera,\\nthe way to think about this\\nis that you have these internal mechanisms\\nof adenosine and circadian clocks,\\nand they're always operating,\\nand what you're trying to\\ndo is provide them anchors,\\nyou're trying to provide them\\nconsistent, powerful anchors\\nso that your cortisol, your melatonin,\\nand then everything that\\ncascades down from that,\\nlike your metabolism and\\nyour ability to learn\\nand your sense of alertness,\\nyour dopamine, your serotonin,\\nall that stuff is timed regularly,\\none of the reasons why there's\\nso much challenge out there\\nwith focus and anxiety and depression,\\nthere are a lot of reasons for that,\\nbut one of the reasons is that\\npeople's internal mechanisms\\naren't anchored to anything regular.\\nNow, this doesn't require\\nbeing neurotically attached\\nto getting up at a very\\nspecific time, going outside,\\nviewing the sunlight at\\nthe same time every day,\\nthese systems, again, will average,\\nbut if you can provide them\\nconsistent light anchors\\nearly in the day and in the evening,\\nand avoiding light at night,\\nyou will be amazed at\\nthe tremendous number\\nof positive effects\\nthat can come from that\\nat the level of metabolic\\nfactors, hormones,\\nand just general feelings of wellbeing,\\nin fact, most of us are familiar\\nwith what it is to not sleep well\\nand all the terrible effects that has,\\nmaybe one night you're\\nfine, two nights even,\\nfor the new parents out\\nthere, I sympathize with you,\\nbut most people are not\\nfamiliar with what it is\\nto sleep really, really\\nwell on a consistent basis,\\nand when you start doing that\\nby controlling your\\nsleep environment, right,\\nget the proper sleep surface,\\nget the proper pillow,\\nget the temperature in the room right,\\nget your light exposure right,\\nstart timing your exercise\\nat normal periods or times\\nthroughout the day and week,\\nit's amazing how many\\nother biological systems\\njust naturally fall in line,\\nand this is why whenever people ask me,\\n\\\"What should I take?\\\"\\nwhich is one of the most\\ncommon questions I get,\\n\\\"What supplement should I take?\\n\\\"What drug should I be taking?\\n\\\"What things should I be taking?\\\"\\nThe first question I always ask\\nthem is, \\\"How's your sleep?\\\"\\nand 90% of the time, they tell me\\nthey either have trouble\\nfalling asleep or staying asleep\\nor they don't feel rested\\nthroughout the day.\\nA brief note about naps,\\nnaps, provided that they're\\nless than one ultradian cycle,\\nprovided they're 20 minutes\\nor 30 minutes or even an hour,\\ncan be very beneficial\\nfor a lot of people,\\nyou don't have to take them,\\nbut many people naturally feel a dip\\nin energy and focus late in the afternoon,\\nin fact, if we were gonna\\nlook at wakefulness,\\nwhat we would find is that you get\\nthat morning light exposure, hopefully,\\nyour cortisol goes up, people\\nwill start feeling awake,\\nand then around two, or three,\\nor four in the afternoon,\\nthere's a spike in everything\\nfrom alertness to ability to learn,\\nsome metabolic factors drop,\\nand then it just naturally comes back up,\\nand then it tapers off\\nas the night goes on.\\nSo for some of you, naps are great,\\nI love taking naps,\\nsome people, they wake up from\\nnaps feeling really groggy,\\nthat's probably because\\nthey're not sleeping\\nas well as they should at night\\nor as long as they should at night,\\nand so they're dropping into REM sleep\\nor deeper forms of sleep in the day time,\\nand then they wake up and\\nthey feel kind of disoriented,\\nother people feel great after a nap,\\nso that's another case where,\\njust like with caffeine,\\nso sort of have to evaluate for yourself.\\nAs we discuss this,\\nyou're probably realizing\\nthis is a lot like nutrition\\nwhere nowadays it's just crazy,\\nI mean, if you go on social media,\\nit's like you've got people\\nwho are pushing carnivore,\\nyou've got other people\\nwho are pushing vegan,\\nother people who are pushing paleo,\\nevery variation of every diet,\\nand there's a lot of data to support\\nany and all of those and\\nthe arguments go on and on,\\nand there's probably a\\nlot of genetic variation\\nand lifestyle variation\\nthat's going to dictate whether or not\\nsomething is good for you,\\nwhether or not you like it,\\nwhether or not you'll stick to it.\\nThe same thing is true for circadian\\nand sleep and wakefulness behaviors,\\nexcept the light-viewing behavior\\nthat I talked about before,\\nthere's no way around that,\\nthat's hardwired into our system,\\nthe same way we could factually say\\nthat everybody needs some nutrition\\nat some level from some source,\\neverybody needs light information\\narriving in their system in\\nsome way at regular intervals,\\nso that's really what this is about.\\nOkay, so naps are gonna\\nbe good for some people,\\nnot for others,\\nI have a colleague, a very\\naccomplished neuroscientist,\\nwho likes to take naps just after lunch,\\nI personally like to take a\\nnap around 3:00 or 4:00 p.m.,\\nbut there's a practice\\nthat I've adopted in the last 5 years\\nthat I've found to be immensely beneficial\\nthat is sort of like\\nnapping but isn't napping,\\nit's a thing that they call yoga nidra,\\nyoga nidra actually means yoga sleep,\\nand it's a sort of meditation\\nthat you listen to,\\nthere are number of scripts,\\nI've talked about this on podcasts before\\nbut I'm going to post a link\\nto the two that I like most,\\nthat allows you to consciously\\nbring your entire body and mind\\ninto a state of deep relaxation,\\nand sometimes you fall asleep\\nand sometimes you don't,\\nthis is done for 10 to 30 or\\neven 60 minutes at a time.\\nThe other thing that works\\nreally well is meditation,\\nso I'm talking about naps,\\nbut I'm also talking about yoga nidra,\\nwhich is sort of a form of meditation,\\nand then more standard\\nforms of meditation,\\nall three of those do something powerful\\nwhich is that they bring our mind\\ninto a state of less so-called\\nsympathetic nervous system activation,\\ngo back and listen to episode one\\nif that doesn't make any sense,\\nwhich is what governs your alertness,\\nand instead, it activates\\ncells and circuits in your body\\nthat promote the\\nparasympathetic nervous system,\\nor the calming system.\\nA lot of people are\\nnot good falling asleep\\nbecause they're not good at calming down,\\nso some people have no\\ntrouble falling asleep,\\nbut many people have a\\nhard time falling asleep,\\nor at least every once in a while\\nexperience challenges falling asleep.\\nI don't have problems\\nfalling asleep most nights,\\nbut I've noticed that\\nif I'm working very hard\\nor if the world is particularly stressful,\\nmy mind gets into a bit\\nof a kind of OCD loop\\nwhere I tend to ruminate on things,\\nand I'm not even thinking\\nabout anything in particular,\\nit's just challenging for me\\nto disengage and fall asleep.\\nMeditation and yoga nidra scripts\\nhave been immensely helpful for me\\nin terms of accelerating\\nthe transition to sleep,\\nso they involve taking a few minutes,\\n10 to 30 minutes or so,\\njust like you would for a nap,\\nand just listening to a\\nscript, almost passively,\\nand it has you do some\\nparticular patterns of breathing\\nand some other kind of\\nbody-scan-like things\\nthat can really help\\npeople learn to relax,\\nnot just in that moment,\\nbut get better at relaxing\\nand turning off thinking\\nin order to fall asleep when\\nthey wanna do that at night.\\nThere's another thing\\nthat's similar to this,\\nwhich is certain forms\\nof hypnosis for sleep,\\nfor that, I'll just\\nrefer you to the website\\nof a colleague and collaborator of mine,\\nDavid Spiegel, who's our associate chair\\nof Psychiatry and Behavioral\\nSciences at Stanford,\\nhe's developed a website,\\nwhich is reverie,\\nR-E-V-E-R-I-E, health.com,\\nso reveriehealth.com,\\nthat has a lot of science-supported,\\nclinically supported hypnosis scripts\\nthat essentially take the brain\\ninto states of deep relaxation\\nfor the sake of rewiring the\\nbrain and neuroplasticity,\\nbut one of those scripts that's there\\nand is available free is for sleep,\\nand we'll talk more about\\nhypnosis at a later time\\nbecause it has a ton of other effects\\nthat aren't just limited to sleep.\\nSo a period of time each day\\nthat you devote to getting better\\nat falling and staying asleep\\nis actually a really\\ngood practice to adopt.\\nThe other thing about these practices\\nlike meditation, yoga nidra, and hypnosis,\\nis people would always say to me,\\n\\\"Well, when should I do them?\\\"\\nand I always say, \\\"Well, the\\nbest time of day to do it\\n\\\"is when you first wake up in the morning,\\n\\\"provided you've gotten\\nyour sunlight already,\\n\\\"anytime you wake up in\\nthe middle of the night,\\n\\\"or any time of day.\\\"\\nIn other words, they're\\nalways good for you\\nbecause it's a training mechanism\\nby which you self-train\\nyour nervous system\\nto go from a state of heightened alertness\\nthat you don't want\\nto heightened relaxation that you do want,\\nand so it's really teaching\\nyou to hit the brake,\\nand that brings us to an even\\nmore important point, perhaps,\\nwhich is, we've all experienced\\nthat we can stay up if we want to, right?\\nIf we wanna stay up late on New Year's\\nor we wanna push an all-nighter,\\nsome people can do that\\nmore easily than others,\\nbut we're all capable of doing that,\\nbut it's very hard to make\\nourselves fall asleep,\\nand so there's a sort of asymmetry\\nto the way our autonomic nervous system,\\nwhich governs this\\nalertness-calmness thing,\\nthe sympathetic and\\nparasympathetic nervous system,\\nthere's an asymmetry there\\nwhere we are more easily\\nable to engage wakefulness\\nand drive wakefulness,\\nwe can force ourselves to stay awake,\\nthan we are able to force\\nourselves to fall asleep,\\nand one of the things that\\nI say over and over again,\\nand I'm gonna continue to\\nsay over and over again,\\nis it's very hard to control\\nthe mind with the mind,\\nwhen you have trouble falling asleep,\\nyou need to look to some\\nmechanism that involves the body,\\nand all the things I described,\\nmeditation, hypnosis, yoga nidra,\\nall involve exhale-emphasized breathing,\\ncertain ways of lying down\\nand controlling the body,\\nwe're gonna get into\\nbreathing in real depth\\nat another time,\\nbut all of those involve using\\nthe body to control the mind\\nrather than trying to, you know,\\nwrestle your mind into a\\ncertain pattern of relaxation,\\nso earlier in episode one, I\\ntalked about the Mobius strip,\\nthis continuous loop that is\\nthe brain-body relationship,\\nor the mind-body relationship,\\nand when we're having\\ntrouble controlling the mind,\\nI encourage people to\\nlook towards the body,\\nlook toward sunlight,\\navoid sunlight and bright light\\nif that happens to be late at night,\\nso there's a theme\\nthat's starting to emerge\\nwhich is, in order to control this thing\\nthat we call the nervous system,\\nwe have to look back to\\nsome of the things we discussed earlier,\\nlike sensation, perception, et cetera,\\nbut we have to ask, what can we control?\\nWell, I'm talking about\\ncontrolling light exposure,\\ncontrolling your breathing and body,\\nI'm not going into details right now\\nbut you can see the yoga nidra script\\nor the reveriehealth.com,\\nor Headspace would be a great place\\nto adopt a meditation practice,\\nany of those are really teaching you\\nto use your body to control your mind,\\nand to allow you to explore\\nthe mind-body relationship\\nin a way that gives you more control\\nover your mind and the\\nmind-body relationship, okay?\\nSo we talked about light,\\nwe talked about activity\\nand timing of light,\\nwe talked about the usefulness of naps,\\nand these things that I'm\\ncalling non-sleep deep rest,\\nwhich include meditation,\\nyoga nidra, and hypnosis,\\nnon-sleep deep rest,\\nor what I, hereafter, we\\nwill refer to as NSDR,\\nnot to be confused with EMDR,\\nI don't think I've ever heard NSDR,\\nso I'm planting a flag for\\nNSDR, non-sleep deep rest,\\nas a way to reset one's\\nability to be awake\\nafter you emerge from NSDR,\\nso to get some more wakefulness\\nand ability to attend,\\nsome emotional stability, reset,\\nas well as make it better\\nand easier to fall asleep\\nwhen you wanna go to sleep at night.\\nNow, the non-sleep deep rest\\ndoes have some research to support it,\\nthere's a beautiful study done\\nout of a university in Denmark,\\nI will later provide a link to that study,\\nthat showed that this meditation\\nand yoga nidra-type meditation\\nallows dopamine and other neuromodulators\\nin an area of the brain\\ncalled the striatum\\nthat's involved in motor\\nplanning and motor execution,\\nto reset itself,\\nin other words, this NSDR\\ncan reset our ability\\nto engage in the world in a\\nway that's very deliberate,\\nand not to throw in another acronym,\\nbut NSDR resets your\\nability to engage in DPOs,\\nduration, path, and outcome,\\nso now you're probably\\nrolling your eyes like,\\n\\\"Oh my goodness, the number of acronyms,\\\"\\nbut just bear with me\\nbecause NSDR is so powerful,\\nbecause first of all, it doesn't require\\nthat you rig yourself to any device,\\nit doesn't require that you\\ntake much time out of your day,\\nit doesn't require that you\\ningest anything, except air,\\nand it can have so many positive effects\\nright down to the neuromodulator level,\\nso I think in the years to come,\\nmy lab's exploring this\\nin a collaboration with\\nDavid Spiegel's lab,\\nbut other labs are\\nlooking at this as well,\\nI think NSDR is going to start\\nto play a more prominent role\\nin what we call wellness and health,\\nboth mental health and physical health,\\nso I encourage you to\\nexplore those practices.\\nOkay, so what about things that we can\\nand maybe should or should not take\\nin order to control\\nand access better sleep\\nand better wakefulness?\\nWe've talked about things\\nyou can do or not do,\\nwe've talked about nutrition\\nand the timing of nutrition,\\nnow let's talk about compounds,\\nthose could be prescription drugs,\\nthose could be supplements,\\nthere are a number of different things\\nthat will affect your\\ncircadian timing and behavior,\\nin fact, almost everything\\nthat you could take\\nwill affect your circadian\\ntiming and behavior,\\nthat's right.\\nSo years ago when I\\nwas in graduate school,\\nI had a professor, unfortunately,\\nhe passed away now,\\nbut his name was Ted Jones,\\nthe late Edward Jones,\\nwho was a world-class neuroanatomist,\\nhe wrote the book on the thalamus,\\nin fact, it's called \\\"The Thalamus,\\\"\\nand an expert on patterns\\nof activation in the brain\\nduring sleep,\\nand I'll never forget that\\nduring one of these lectures,\\nsomeone asked Ted the question,\\n\\\"What is the effect of some drug\\n\\\"on these waves of activity in\\nthe thalamus?\\\" or something,\\nand his answer was incredible.\\nNow, he was a pretty gruff guy,\\nand so his answer was delivered\\nin the form of a kind of\\naggressive direct statement,\\nhe said, \\\"A drug is a substance\\n\\\"that when injected into a person,\\n\\\"produces a scientific publication,\\\"\\nand what he was saying\\nis actually quite true,\\nwhich is that most every compound\\nwill have some effect on\\nsome aspect of biology,\\nthis is why it's hard\\nto sort through everything\\nthat's on PubMed,\\nif you put any molecule or\\ncompound or drug into PubMed\\nand then you put sleep next to\\nit, or alertness next to it,\\nyou're likely to find a paper\\nwhere there's an effect,\\nbut that's not necessarily telling you\\nthat that drug is helpful for that,\\nwhat it's telling you is\\nthat anytime you change what you take\\nor you stop taking something,\\nsay you're taking sleeping\\npills, Ambien or whatever it is,\\nand you stop taking them,\\nyour sleep behavior will change.\\nLet's stay you take an aspirin\\nand you don't normally take aspirin,\\nyou will shift your circadian rhythm,\\nnow you might not shift it perceptibly,\\nyou might not create\\nproblems for yourself,\\nbut anytime you ingest a\\ncompound at high potency,\\nyou're going to provide some\\nshift to your circadian rhythm.\\nNow, that said, there are a couple things\\nthat are directly in line with the biology\\nrelated to falling and staying asleep\\nand directly in line with\\nthe biology of wakefulness,\\nthere's a whole category of things,\\nlike stimulants, cocaine, amphetamine,\\nand prescription stimulants, that are,\\nthe prescription ones were designed\\nfor the treatment of narcolepsy,\\nso things like modafinil or armodafinil\\nthat are designed to created wakefulness,\\nthey are all essentially chemical variants\\nof things that increase\\nepinephrine and dopamine.\\nNow, of course, I'm of the standpoint\\nthat things like cocaine and amphetamine\\nare just across the board bad,\\nthey have so many addictive\\nand terrible effects,\\nin the proper setting prescribed\\nby the proper professional,\\nthings like modafinil for\\nnarcolepsy might be appropriate,\\nI know that a lot of people\\nout there take Adderall,\\neven though they haven't\\nbeen prescribed Adderall,\\nin order to increase wakefulness,\\nthat is essentially, well,\\nit's illegal for one,\\nbut also it's abusing the system\\nin the sense that you're pushing back\\non the adenosine system\\nslightly differently\\nthan you do caffeine,\\nit will make you feel more alert,\\nthere tends to be a heavy rebound\\nand they do have an addictive potential,\\nthere are also some other effects of those\\nthat could be quite bad,\\nso we're gonna explore stimulants\\nin a whole month related to drugs,\\nbut there are some supplements\\nand some things that are\\nsafer, certainly safer,\\nand that, in cases where you're\\ndoing all the right behaviors,\\nyou're exercising and eating correctly\\nand you're still having\\ntrouble with sleep,\\nthat can be beneficial for\\nfalling and staying asleep.\\nNow, I wanna be very clear,\\nI am not pushing supplements,\\nI am just pointing you toward some things\\nthat have been shown in\\npeer-reviewed studies\\nto have some benefit.\\nThe first one is magnesium,\\nthere are many forms of magnesium,\\nbut certain forms of magnesium\\ncan have positive effects on sleepiness\\nand the ability to stay asleep,\\nmainly by way of increasing\\nneurotransmitters like GABA\\nwhich help turn off the DPO,\\nthe kind of thinking about the future,\\nduration-path-outcome analysis,\\nand make one's mind kind\\nof drift in space and time\\nand make it easier to fall asleep,\\nthere are a lot of forms\\nof magnesium out there,\\nbut in particular is magnesium\\nthreonate, T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E,\\nwhich you have to check to\\nsee if this is right for you,\\ncheck with your doctor,\\nbut magnesium threonate is\\nassociated with transporters in the body\\nthat bring more of it into cells\\nthat allow people to feel\\nthis kind of drowsiness\\nand help them fall asleep,\\nso I personally, I can only\\ntalk about what I personally do,\\nI personally take 3 or 400\\nmilligrams of magnesium threonate\\nabout 30 to 60 minutes before sleep,\\nand it helps me fall asleep.\\nThe other thing is theanine, T-H-E-A,\\nT-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine,\\n100 to 200 milligrams of theanine, for me,\\nalso helps me turn off\\nmy mind and fall asleep,\\nI take it 30 to 60 minutes\\nthroughout the day.\\nInterestingly, theanine\\nis now being introduced\\nto a lot of energy drinks\\nin order to take away the jitters\\nthat are associated with\\ndrinking too much caffeine\\nor with some other things\\nthat are in the energy drinks,\\nenergy drinks can be problematic,\\nthey can contain a lot of L-taurine,\\nI'll just tell you an anecdote,\\nwhen I was a postdoc,\\nI was drinking a lot of a\\nparticular energy drink,\\nit has a lot of taurine in it,\\nand actually the whites of my eyes,\\nthe sclera, as it's called,\\nof my eyes turned beet red,\\nand I went to a friend\\nwho's an ophthalmologist,\\nI said, \\\"Look, I'm not a marijuana smoker,\\n\\\"I haven't been hit on the head,\\n\\\"I don't know what's going on,\\\"\\nand he looked and he said,\\n\\\"I think you've got some\\nmicrovascular damage,\\\"\\nand we walked through what\\nI was taking and doing,\\nand he said, \\\"Oh, it's\\nprobably the taurine,\\n\\\"excessive levels of taurine\\n\\\"can create some microvascular damage.\\\"\\nSo if you're having\\nmicrovascular damage in your eye,\\nyou probably have microvascular damage\\ndeeper in your skull, so I stopped,\\nthat's the reason why I\\ndon't take energy drinks,\\nso just a consideration,\\nagain, I'm not here to tell\\nyou what to do or not do,\\nbut just wanna arm you with information.\\nThe thing about theanine and magnesium\\nis taken together, they\\ndo, for some people,\\nthey can make them so\\nsleepy and sleep so deeply\\nthat they actually have trouble\\nwaking up in the morning,\\nso you have to play with\\nthese things and titrate them\\nif you decide to use them,\\nagain, if you decide to go this route,\\nI would not start by taking supplements,\\nI would start by getting your\\nlight-viewing behavior correct,\\nand then think about your nutrition\\nand then think about your activity\\nand then think about whether\\nor not you wanna supplement,\\nwe already talked about melatonin earlier.\\nThere's another supplement\\nthat could be quite useful,\\nwhich is apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N,\\nwhich is a derivative of chamomile,\\n50 milligrams of apigenin\\nalso can augment or support\\nthis kind of creation of a sleepiness\\nto help fall asleep and stay asleep.\\nA note about sleepwalkers and\\npeople with very vivid dreams,\\ntheanine can often make\\nyour dreams very vivid,\\nsleepwalkers should be\\ncareful about taking theanine,\\neveryone should be careful\\nabout taking anything,\\nand don't take anything\\nwithout consulting your\\nboard-certified M.D.\\nor healthcare professional first, okay?\\nYour health is your responsibility,\\nI am not gonna take responsibility\\nfor what you decide to do\\nexperimentally in any case,\\nbut especially as it relates\\nto supplementation and drugs.\\nAs a important point, apigenin\\nis a fairly potent estrogen inhibitor,\\nso women who want to keep\\ntheir estrogen levels high,\\nor at whatever levels\\nthey happen to be at,\\nshould probably avoid apigenin altogether,\\nand men, take that into\\nconsideration as well,\\nmen need estrogen also,\\nyou don't wanna completely\\neliminate your estrogen,\\nthat it can create all\\nsorts of bad effects\\non libido and cognition, et cetera,\\nso apigenin in some people\\nis gonna be a pretty\\nstrong estrogen inhibitor,\\nso keep that in mind.\\nThere are other things you can take\\nto help you sleep better,\\nthose are the legal ones\\nthat, at least I'm aware of,\\nhave pretty broad safety margins,\\nbut again, you need to explore\\nyour safety margins with any compound.\\nI think a great website\\nthat I can refer you to is examine.com,\\nexamine, the word, just as it\\nsounds, .com, is a website,\\nI have no relation to them,\\nbut there, you can find links\\nto peer-reviewed studies\\nfor any compound or supplement,\\nas well as some important warnings\\nrelated to the things I discussed,\\nas well as any other thing\\nthat you might decide to supplement with\\nor ingest to help improve your sleep.\\nOkay, that was a lot of information\\nabout how to get better at sleeping,\\nfalling asleep, wakefulness, et cetera.\\nAn important feature of\\nthis podcast, as you know,\\nis that we dive deep into topics\\nfor several episodes at a time,\\nat least a month at a time,\\nso by stopping here, I recognize\\nthat there are probably\\nmany

science.\\n(energetic music)\",\n          \"- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\\nwhere we discuss science\\nand science based tools\\nfor everyday life.\\n[cheerful music]\\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\\nand I'm a professor of\\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\\nToday, we are discussing aggression.\\nI'm going to explain to you that there are\\nseveral different types of\\naggression, for instance,\\nreactive aggression versus\\nproactive aggression.\\nMeaning sometimes people\\nwill be aggressive\\nbecause they feel threatened\\nor they are protecting\\nthose that they love,\\nwho also feel threatened.\\nThere's also proactive\\naggression where people\\ngo out of their way to\\ndeliberately try and harm others.\\nAnd there is indirect\\naggression, which is aggression,\\nnot involving physical\\nviolence, for instance,\\nshaming people and things of that sort.\\nIt turns out that there are\\ndifferent biological mechanisms\\nunderlying each of the\\ndifferent types of aggression.\\nAnd today I will define those for you.\\nI'll talk about the neural\\ncircuits in the brain and body\\nthat mediate each of the\\ndifferent kinds of aggression.\\nTalk about some of the\\nhormones and peptides\\nand neurotransmitters involved.\\nI promise to make it\\nall accessible to you,\\neven if you do not have any\\nbiology or science background,\\nI will also discuss\\ntools, psychological tools\\nand biological tools that one can use to\\nbetter control aggression.\\nNow, right here at the outset,\\nI want to acknowledge that any\\ndiscussion about aggression\\nhas to have an element\\nof context within it.\\nTo be fair, human beings\\ninvest a lot of money,\\na lot of time, and a lot of energy,\\nand indeed can even derive\\npleasure from aggression.\\nLater I'll talk about neural\\ncircuits in the brain and body\\nthat reinforce, in other words,\\nreward through the release\\nof chemicals that make people feel good.\\nActs of aggression.\\nHowever, what I'm mainly referring to\\nis the context in which\\nhuman beings will pay money\\nin order to derive what we\\ncall vicarious aggression,\\nput it simply people spend\\nan enormous amount of money\\nand time and energy watching\\nother people engage in,\\nfor instance, aggressive sports.\\nAnd we know that observing\\nyour team winning\\nover another team causes the\\nrelease of neurochemicals\\nin your brain and body\\nthat make you feel good.\\nAnd yes, that can make\\nyou feel more aggressive.\\nWe also know of course that\\nmost governments invest\\nmany billions if not trillions of dollars\\nin infrastructure,\\ntechnologies and human beings\\nin order to engage in\\naggression if needed,\\nso-called military warfare, et cetera.\\nSo today's discussion will\\ninclude a description of\\naggression in the pathological sense.\\nWe'll actually talk about an\\nexplosive aggressive disorder\\nthat most of you probably\\nhaven't heard of,\\nbut is actually far more\\ncommon than perhaps, you know,\\nwe'll talk about the role of\\nthings like attention deficit,\\nhyperactivity disorder,\\nand how that can relate\\nto aggression through\\nthe relationship between\\nimpulsivity and aggression.\\nAnd we'll talk about verbal aggression,\\nphysical aggression, proactive aggression,\\nas mentioned before,\\nand reactive aggression.\\nI'm certain that by\\nthe end of the episode,\\nyou will come away with a much\\nmore thorough understanding\\nof what this thing that we\\ncall aggression really is.\\nAnd when you see it in other people,\\nI think it will make more sense to you.\\nAnd when you observe it in\\nyourself or the impulse to engage\\nin aggression, verbal,\\nor physical or otherwise,\\nI hope that you'll\\nunderstand it better as well.\\nAnd of course, the tools\\nthat I will describe\\nshould allow you to modulate and control\\naggressive tendencies or\\npredispositions to aggressiveness\\nand just generally to be\\nable to engage with people\\nin a more adaptive way overall.\\nBefore we begin, I'd like to\\nemphasize that this

us by ROKA.\\nROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses\\nthat are the absolute highest quality.\\nThe company was founded by\\ntwo All-American swimmers\\nfrom Stanford and everything\\nabout their eyeglasses\\nand sunglasses were designed\\nwith performance in mind,\\nI've spent a lifetime\\nworking on the biology\\nof the visual system, I can\\ntell you that your visual system\\nhas to contend with some\\npretty tough challenges\\nas you move throughout the day.\\nFor instance, if you go\\nfrom a brightly lit region\\nto a dimmer region, your\\nvisual system has to adjust.\\nROKA eyeglasses and\\nsunglasses were designed\\nwith those sorts of adjustments in mind.\\nSo for instance, if you're\\noutside in the shade,\\nyou move into the sun and\\nthen back into the shade,\\nyou don't have to take\\nyour sunglasses on and off.\\nTheir glasses were initially designed\\nfor sports performance\\nand the great thing is\\nthey could be used for\\nthat, but also they have\\na terrific aesthetic, so you can wear them\\nto work or out to dinner.\\nI wear readers at night\\nand when I drive at night\\nand I wear sunglasses, if I'm out a lot\\non really bright days.\\nThe terrific thing about\\nROKA glasses is that even\\nif you get sweaty, they won't fall off.\\nSo you can run with them,\\nyou can cycle with them.\\nOr as I mentioned before, you can just\\nwear them out and about.\\nIf you'd like to try ROKA,\\nyou can go to roka.com,\\nthat's R-O-K-A.com and\\nenter the code \\\"Huberman\\\"\\nto save 20% off your first order.\\nAgain, that's ROKA roka.com\\nand enter

started sleeping on a Helix mattress\\na little over a year ago,\\nand it's the best sleep\\nI've had ever since.\\nIf you go to the Helix site,\\nthey have a terrific sleep quiz\\nthat just takes a few minutes,\\nask you questions like,\\n\\\"Do you tend to sleep on your side,\\nyour back or your stomach?\\\"\\nMaybe you don't know\\nbecause you're asleep,\\nbut many people do know.\\nAnd even if you don't know that's okay,\\nit will also ask you questions like,\\n\\\"Do you tend to run hot or cold?\\\"\\nDo you tend to wake up in the\\nmiddle of the night or not?\\nAnd by taking that brief\\nquiz, they will match you\\nto the specific mattress\\nthat's ideal for you\\nand your sleep needs.\\nAnd that's really what sets\\nHelix Sleep mattresses apart.\\nEverybody's unique, and they know that.\\nSo if you take this\\nquiz, you'll get matched\\nto a particular mattress.\\nFor me, it was the\\n\\\"Dusk\\\" mattress D-U-S-K,\\nbut again, that's just me,\\nand you may match to that one,\\nor you may match to a different one.\\nIf you're interested in\\nupgrading your mattress\\nand sleeping much better, go\\nto helixsleep.com/huberman.\\nTake that two minute sleep\\nquiz and they'll match you\\nto a customized mattress and\\nyou'll get up to $200 off\\nany mattress order and two free pillows.\\nI also love their pillows.\\nI've always had this issue with pillows\\nthat they heat up too much.\\nI'm always looking for the\\npillow that can cool itself.\\nSomehow the pillows stay nice and cool.\\nThey're also not too big,\\nso I'm not propped up,\\nnot getting the Text Neck\\nin the middle of the night,\\nwhere I'm letting my chin push my chest,\\nnor am I falling back and\\nhaving trouble breathing\\nin the middle of the night.\\nThey're designed just right.\\nThey also have a 10 years warranty\\nand you get to try it out for\\na hundred nights, risk free.\\nThey'll even pick it up for\\nyou if you don't love it.\\nBut I think that you will.\\nAgain, if you're interested, you can go\\nto helixsleep.com/huberman\\nfor up to $200 off\\nand two free pillows.\\nLet's talk about aggression.\\nI think that many people\\nout there are put off\\nby aggression, although\\nothers are drawn to aggression\\nboth in themselves and when\\nobserving it in others.\\nThe reason to talk about aggression is,\\nthat as mentioned before,\\nthe context of aggression really matters.\\nSo there are instances where\\naggression is adaptive.\\nFor instance, a mother\\nprotecting her children\\nif she's being attacked,\\nor if her children are being threatened.\\nI think most people would\\nagree that so-called\\nmaternal aggression of that sort,\\nprovided the context is\\nright, is a great thing.\\nProtecting our young is\\nafter all one of the primary\\nadaptive drives of our species,\\nand thank goodness it is.\\nOf course, other forms of aggression\\nlike unprovoked, proactive aggression,\\nsomebody simply being\\nviolent to somebody else,\\neven when unprovoked, most of us cringe\\nwhen we see that kind of behavior,\\nit can even evoke aggression in people\\nwhen they observe that kind of behavior.\\nSo again, context really matters,\\nbut a more general and perhaps\\nan even more important reason\\nto think about and understand aggression\\nis that by understanding the biology\\nand psychology of aggression, you will be\\nin a much better position to understand\\nhow all emotional states come to be,\\nboth in yourself and in others.\\nFor instance, many of you have\\nprobably heard the statement\\nthat I believe arises from pop psychology,\\nnot from formal academic psychology,\\nthat aggression is just sadness.\\nIt's a form of sadness that's amplified\\nand it shows up as aggression.\\nBut when we look at the underlying biology\\nand the peer reviewed literature on this,\\nnothing could be further from the truth.\\nWe have distinct circuits\\nin the brain for aggression\\nversus grief and mourning,\\nthose are non-overlapping.\\nNow that doesn't mean that you\\ncan't be sad and aggressive\\nor in a state of mourning and\\naggressive at the same time,\\nbut the idea that sadness and aggression\\nare one in the same\\nthing is simply not true.\\nAnd by understanding that,\\nor perhaps by understanding\\nthat irritability and aggression\\nare not the same thing,\\nyou'll be in a much\\nbetter position to apply\\nsome of the tools that we will\\ntalk about in this episode\\nin order to be able to\\nreduce or eliminate,\\nor if it's adaptive to you\\nto modulate aggression.\\nAnd yes, there are cases where\\nmodulating your aggression\\nin some cases, even amplifying\\naggression can be adaptive.\\nNow this of course is\\nnot the first discussion\\nabout the biology of aggression\\nor the psychology of aggression.\\nAnd we really can look to the\\nbeginning of the last century\\nas the time in which the formal study\\nof aggression really began.\\nOne of the names that's most\\nassociated with the formal\\nstudy of aggression is none\\nother than Konrad Lorenz.\\nSome of you may be\\nfamiliar with that name,\\nothers of you may not be\\nfamiliar with that name.\\nKonrad Lorenz studied\\nso-called imprinting behaviors\\nand fixed action pattern behaviors.\\nHe's most famous, at least\\nin scientific circles,\\nfor getting geese to believe\\nthat he was their parent.\\nAnd if you were to put into\\nGoogle Conrad with a K, Lorenz,\\njust as it sounds, Konrad Lorenz, geese,\\nyou're going to see a\\nlot of photos of Conrad\\nwalking down roads with a\\nlot of geese following him\\nor swimming in lakes with a\\nlot of geese following him.\\nHe had a habit of geese adopting him\\nbecause of the behaviors\\nthat he partook in.\\nSo he would swim out on a lake\\nin front of a bunch of\\nlittle geese and then\\nthey would think that he was the parent\\nand they would imprint on him.\\nHe even lived with these\\nanimals and they lived with him,\\nsort of a strange\\ncharacter from what I hear.\\nBut nonetheless, all\\nthis work was deserving\\nof a Nobel prize because\\nwhat he discovered\\nwere fixed action patterns.\\nThat is patterns of behavior\\nthat could be evoked by a single stimulus.\\nOkay. This is really important.\\nThe idea that you can get a\\nwhole category of behaviors,\\nlike swimming behind a parent,\\nor looking to somebody for\\ncomfort, and only them,\\nthe idea that you could\\nget a huge category\\nof different behaviors in a\\nbunch of different contexts\\ntriggered by just the presence\\nof that person is remarkable,\\nbecause what it suggested\\nand what turns out to be true\\nis that there are neural circuits,\\nnot just individual brain\\nareas, but collections\\nof brain areas that work together\\nto engage a pattern of behaviors.\\nAnd that's the first fundamental principle\\nthat we need to define today,\\nthat when we talk about aggression,\\nwe are talking about\\nactivation of neural circuits,\\nnot individual brain\\nareas, but neural circuits\\nthat get played out in\\nsequence like keys on a piano,\\nbut that playing out in sequence means\\nthat aggression is a verb.\\nIt has a beginning, a middle\\nand an end, and it's a process.\\nIt's not an event.\\nAnd as you'll see, that turns\\nout to be very important\\nin terms of thinking about\\nhow one can halt aggression,\\nprevent it from happening\\nbefore it's initiated,\\nor maybe even prolonging aggression,\\nif that's what's needed.\\nNow, Konrad Lorenz had no real\\nknowledge of neural circuits.\\nI mean, obviously he\\nknew there was this thing\\nthat we call a brain and a nervous system,\\nand he knew that there\\nwere chemicals in the brain\\nand hormones and things of that sort\\nthat were likely to play a role,\\nbut he really didn't take\\nany measures to define\\nwhat the neural circuits were,\\nfrankly, he didn't need to.\\nHe had his Nobel prize and he\\ndid all this beautiful work.\\nHe's known for an abundance of work,\\nbut he did think about what\\nsorts of underlying processes\\ncould drive something like aggression.\\nAnd he talked about one particular feature\\nthat's especially important,\\nand that's this notion of a pressure.\\nThe idea that yes, certain\\nhormones will bias somebody\\nor an animal to be aggressive,\\ncertain neural transmitter\\nstates, and you'll learn\\nwhat those are today will bias somebody\\nto be more or less aggressive,\\nmaybe even submissive and passive,\\nmaybe outright proactively\\naggressive towards anyone\\nor anything in front of them.\\nAnd yes, of course there\\nwill be historical features\\nbased on their childhood,\\net cetera, et cetera.\\nHe understood that there will\\nbe a constellation of things\\nthat would drive people to be aggressive.\\nAnd he described a so-called pressure,\\nalmost like a hydraulic pressure.\\nJust think about fluid\\npressure in a small container\\nbeing pushed, pushed,\\npushed until the can,\\nor the container is ready to explode\\nand how multiple features,\\nmultiple variables\\ncould impinge on that\\nand create that pressure.\\nIt turns out that's exactly\\nthe way the system works.\\nThere is no single brain area\\nthat flips the switch for aggression.\\nAlthough we'll soon talk\\nabout a brain structure\\nthat generally houses the propensity\\nand the output of aggression.\\nThis notion of a hydraulic\\npressure that can drive us\\ntoward aggressive behavior\\nor conversely can be\\nvery low pressure and keep us\\nin a state of non-reactivity,\\nmaybe even passivity or submissiveness\\nis a very important feature\\nbecause it really captures\\nthe essence of how neural circuits work\\nwhen we're talking about\\nprimitive behaviors generally.\\nAnd you can start to notice\\nthis in yourself and in others,\\nyou can start to notice\\nwhen you are veering\\ntoward aggression or\\nwhen someone is veering\\ntoward aggression, verbal or physical.\\nNow that veering is the buildup\\nof this hydraulic pressure\\nthat Lorenz was referring to,\\nand it really does have an\\nunderlying biological basis.\\nNow it was some years later\\nthat the first experiments\\ncame along, which really\\nstarted to identify\\nthe brain areas and the\\nbiological so-called pressures\\nthat can induce aggressive behavior.\\nAnd the person that really\\ngets credit for this\\nis a guy by the name of Walter Hess,\\nwho at that time was working on cats.\\nAnd I know that when say working on cats,\\na lot of people will cringe.\\nA lot of people have cats as pets,\\nand certainly cats can be delightful.\\nSome people like them more,\\nsome people like them less.\\nMost people cringe at the idea\\nof doing experiments on cats.\\nI should say that these days,\\nvery few laboratories work on cats.\\nMost laboratories that\\nwork on animal models\\nwill work on flies, Drosophila fruit flies\\nfor their capacity to do genetics,\\non laboratory mice, sometimes\\nrats, but usually mice.\\nAnd occasionally you'll find a\\nlab that still works on cats.\\nBack in the time of Hess,\\nvery few laboratories\\nworked on mice, most laboratories\\nworked on cats or rats.\\nAnd the reason for that is\\nnowadays most laboratories\\nuse mice if they use animal models\\nbecause of the genetic\\ntools that exist in mice\\nto knock out this gene or\\nknock in this gene, et cetera,\\nwhich can't be done in\\nhumans or non-human primates,\\nat least not very easily\\nat this point in history.\\nSo when I say he was working on cats,\\nI realized that probably\\nevokes some negative emotions\\nin some of you, maybe even\\naggression in some of you,\\nwhat we can do, however,\\nis look at the data\\nand make use of the data in\\nterms of our understanding.\\nWhat Hess did was he\\nhad cats that were awake\\nand he was able to lower\\na stimulating electrode\\ninto their brain.\\nNow keep in mind that the brain\\ndoes not have any pain sensors.\\nSo after a small hole\\nis made in the skull,\\nelectrodes are lowered into the brain.\\nThis is what's done commonly\\nin human neurosurgery.\\nAnd he was able to stimulate\\ndifferent brain areas\\nand he was sort of poking around.\\nAnd when I say sort of,\\nhe was doing this with\\nsome logical intent and purpose,\\nhe wasn't just poking\\naround in there for fun.\\nHe was trying to identify brain\\nregions that could generate\\nentire categories of\\nbehavior, ALA Lorenz, right?\\nThese fixed action pattern behaviors.\\nEventually his electrode landed in a site\\nand he provided electrical\\nstimulation to the cat\\nthat caused this otherwise\\npassive purring relaxing cat\\nto suddenly go into an absolute rage.\\nSo arched back, hissing hair up.\\nSo called piloerection,\\nwhere the hairs go up,\\nanimals try to make\\nthemselves as big as possible\\noften when they're aggressive.\\nDrooling, maybe even\\nspitting, believe it or not,\\ncats and other animals can do this.\\nAnd the cat tried to\\nattack him or anyone else,\\nand anything else, even inanimate objects\\nwhen he stimulated this\\nparticula brain area.\\nSo Hess obviously took notice\\nof this incredible\\ntransformation in behavior.\\nAnd the fact that when he\\nturned off the stimulation\\nof this particular brain area,\\nthe cat very quickly within seconds,\\nwent back to being passive calm kitty.\\nNow, of course, he repeated\\nthis experiment in other animals\\nbecause he had to confirm that\\nit wasn't just happenstance,\\nthat there wasn't something\\nunique about this one cat\\nthat perhaps he had stimulated an area\\nthat had been built up during\\nthe kittenhood of this cat\\nand had been reactivated.\\nMaybe this kitten had been\\ntraumatized early in life\\nor scared and reactivation\\nof a particular circuit,\\nunique to that cat created\\nthis aggressive behavior.\\nThat wasn't the case,\\nevery cat that he looked at\\nand stimulated this particular brain area,\\nthe cat would immediately\\ngo into an aggressive,\\nalmost rage type behavior.\\nNow, of course we can't anthropomorphize.\\nWe don't know what the cat was feeling.\\nFor all we know the cat could be happy,\\nalthough that seems pretty unlikely\\nand later experiments done in mice,\\nbut also in humans confirm that indeed,\\nstimulation of this brain area evoked\\nnot just behavioral aggression,\\nbut also subjective feelings\\nof aggression and anger.\\nSo what was this incredible brain area,\\nor rather, I should say,\\nwhat is the brain area\\nthat harbored this incredible capacity\\nto generate aggressive\\nbehavior in Hess's experiments?\\nWell, for those of you\\nthat are regular listeners\\nof this podcast, you'll\\nprobably be relieved to know\\nthat today we're going to talk\\nabout some new neural circuits,\\noftentimes we'll center\\nback on the amygdala\\nor the prefrontal cortex,\\nand those names will come up.\\nAnd for those of you that\\nhaven't heard them before,\\ndon't worry, I'll make it clear as to what\\nthose brain areas are and what they do.\\nBut today we're going to talk a lot about\\nthe so-called VMH or\\nventromedial hypothalamus.\\nThe ventromedial\\nhypothalamus is a nucleus,\\nmeaning a small collection of neurons...\\nWhat are neurons?\\nNerve cells, and that\\nsmall collection of neurons\\nthat we call the ventromedial\\nhypothalamus is truly small.\\nIt's only about 1,500 neurons\\non one side of your brain\\nand a matching 1,500 neurons\\non the other side of your brain\\nand that combined 3000 neurons\\nor so, it's not exactly 3000,\\nbut 3000 neurons or so\\nis sufficient to generate\\naggressive behavior of the sort\\nthat Hess observed in the\\ncat, and believe it or not,\\nwhen you see somebody\\nwho's in an act of rage\\nor in an act of verbal aggression\\nor in an act of defensive aggression,\\nprotecting their family or loved\\nones or country, et cetera,\\nalmost certainly those neurons\\nare engaged in that behavior.\\nThose neurons are perhaps\\neven generating that behavior.\\nAnd next I'll describe some\\nexperiments that were done\\njust recently within\\nthe last 10 years or so,\\nbut leading right up until this year\\nand even last month that keep confirming\\nagain and again and again,\\nthat it is the activity of neurons\\nin the ventromedial hypothalamus\\nthat are both necessary\\nand sufficient to\\ngenerate the full catalog\\nof aggressive behaviors.\\nNow, before I go further to describe\\nthe beautiful recent studies on the VMH,\\nthe ventromedial hypothalamus,\\nand the important role of testosterone,\\nand more importantly, estrogen,\\nin the activation of aggressive\\nbehavior, that's right.\\nThat's soon to be clear to\\nyou why that's the case.\\nI want to emphasize that the\\nventromedial hypothalamus\\nis something that we\\nshould all care about.\\nWhy?\\nWell, it turns out that many categories\\nof psychiatric disorders,\\ndevelopmental disorders,\\nand psychological challenges,\\nthings like schizophrenia,\\nPTSD, post-traumatic stress\\ndisorder, depression,\\nborderline personality disorder,\\nand even certain forms of\\nautism can include elements\\nof aggression and even violence.\\nNow it's certainly not the case\\nthat aggression and violence\\nare present in all people\\nwho suffer from schizophrenia\\nor PTSD or depression or autism\\nor borderline personality disorder.\\nI'm absolutely not saying that.\\nHowever, it can be a feature of those.\\nAnd it's a well described feature\\nin terms of trying to\\nunderstand the constellation\\nof challenges that people suffer\\nfrom when they have those.\\nSo thinking about the VMH goes\\nway beyond just understanding\\nbasic aggression in the\\ncontext of adaptive aggression.\\nSo, you know, when\\nearlier I use the example,\\nmaternal aggression, that's one\\nadaptive form of aggression.\\nIt also can be pathologic aggression,\\nmeaning it can harm ourselves or others.\\nSo keep this in mind as we go forward,\\nbecause later we're going\\nto talk about specific tools\\ndesigned to modulate or prevent\\naggression in, for instance,\\npeople with attention deficit\\nhyperactivity disorder,\\nand especially kids with ADHD.\\nIn the meantime, let's return to the VMH,\\nthis relatively small\\ncollection of neurons.\\nAnd the reason I say\\nrelatively small is, well,\\nyour brain has many hundreds\\nof billions of neurons,\\nmaybe even trillions of neurons,\\nthe exact number of\\nneurons isn't really clear,\\nbut it's a lot.\\nAnd it certainly is a lot\\nrelative to the number of neurons\\nthis 3000 or so neurons\\nliving in your hypothalamus\\nthat can evoke this aggressive response.\\nExperiments done by David\\nAnderson's lab at Caltech\\nwere really the first to\\nparse the fine circuitry\\nand to really show that the\\nventromedial hypothalamus\\nis both necessary and sufficient\\nfor aggressive behavior.\\nThese are important experiments\\nand they're worth knowing about.\\nWhat they did was they\\nidentified, first of all,\\nwhere the ventromedial\\nhypothalamus was in the mouse,\\nthat was pretty straightforward\\nto do was sort of known\\nbefore they started these experiments.\\nAnd then they analyzed which\\ngenes, meaning which DNA,\\nwhich of course becomes RNA\\nand RNA becomes protein,\\nwhich DNA and therefore\\nwhich proteins are expressed\\nin particular cells of the\\nventromedial hypothalamus.\\nAnd it turns out that\\nthere's a particular category\\nof neurons in the\\nventromedial hypothalamus\\nthat make an estrogen receptor.\\nAnd it is those neurons in\\nparticular that are responsible\\nfor generating aggressive behavior.\\nHow did they know this?\\nWell, they used a tool that's\\nactually been described\\nby a previous guest of this podcast.\\nWe had an episode with the\\npsychiatrist and bioengineer\\nand my colleague at\\nStanford School of Medicine,\\nKarl Deisseroth, he and\\nothers have developed tools\\nthat allow people to control\\nthe activity of neurons\\nessentially by remote control,\\nby shining light on those neurons.\\nSo in the context of an\\nexperiment on a mouse,\\nwhich is what David's\\nlab did, and these were\\nthe beautiful experiments of Dayu Lin\\nwho's now in her own laboratory\\nat New York University,\\nput a little fiber optic\\ncable down into the brain\\ninto the hypothalamus\\nthat is of the mouse.\\nThe mouse is able to move around\\nin its cage freely moving,\\neven though it has a little\\ntether, this little wire,\\nit's a very thin wire.\\nAnd that little thin wire is actually\\na little what we call optrode.\\nAnd the experimentalist\\nin this case, Dayu,\\nwas able to stimulate the turning on\\nof a little bit of blue\\nlight and that blue light\\nactivated only those\\nestrogen receptor neurons\\nin only the ventromedial hypothalamus\\nand the way she was able to do that,\\nis she had introduced a\\ngene that had been developed\\nby our friend, Karl\\nDeisseroth that allows light\\nto trigger electrical\\nactivity in those neurons.\\nSo if any of that is confusing,\\nor if all of that is confusing,\\nhere's the experiment.\\nThere's a mouse in a cage.\\nIt has a little wire\\ncoming out of its head.\\nIt doesn't notice, believe it or not.\\nWe know this 'cause it's\\nstill eating and mating\\nand doing all the things\\nthat mics like to do\\non a daily basis and sleeping, et cetera.\\nAnd the mere pressing of\\na button will activate\\na little bit of light released\\nat the end of that wire,\\nthat light activates particular\\nneurons in this case,\\nit's the estrogen receptor\\ncontaining neurons\\nin only the ventromedial hypothalamus.\\nWhen that mouse is in a\\ncage with another mouse,\\na couple of things happen depending on\\nwhat the other mouse is, or we could say\\nwho the other mouse is.\\nIf it's a male mouse and you put in there\\nwith a female mouse, the male\\nmouse will attempt to mate\\nwith a female mouse\\nprovided that the male mouse\\nhas gone through puberty.\\nHe will try to mount and\\nmate with the female mouse.\\nNow female mice are either\\nin a receptive phase\\nor a non-receptive phase of\\ntheir so-called estrous cycle.\\nThey don't have a menstrual 28 day cycle\\nThey have an estrous cycle.\\nAnd on particular days\\nof the estrous cycle,\\nthey are not happy to mate.\\nThey will basically\\nkeep their hindquarters\\naway from the male mouse at all costs.\\nThey'll even attack the male mouse.\\nOn certain days of the\\nestrous cycle, however,\\nthe female mouse will undergo\\nwhat's called lordosis,\\nwhich is an arching of her\\nback and she'll allow the male\\nto mount and mate with her.\\nSo a large number of\\nexperiments were done,\\nbut the first experiment really\\nwas to put the male mouse\\nin with a female mouse\\nwho's in the so-called\\nreceptive phase of estrus.\\nThat is, she will allow mating\\nand he starts mating with her\\nand they go through\\nthe standard repertoire\\nof mating behaviors that\\nyou observe in mice:\\nmounting, thrusting,\\nintromission as it's called\\nin the mouse sex world.\\nWell, I guess I don't know\\nwhat the mice call it,\\nbut that's what the experimenters call it.\\nAnd then afterwards that\\nhe will dismount, okay.\\nSo they observe this kind\\nof mounting and sex behavior\\nis very typical, but about\\nhalfway through the behavior,\\nDayu turned on the light to stimulate\\nthese estrogen receptor containing neurons\\nonly in the male mouse\\nand what she observed\\nwas incredibly dramatic.\\nThe male mouse ceases from trying to mate\\nwith the female mouse\\nand immediately tries\\nto kill the female mouse.\\nHe starts attacking her.\\nThen she turns off the\\nlight, the male stops\\nand goes back to trying to\\nmate with the female mouse.\\nSo I'm sure all of this was very confusing\\nand disturbing to the female mouse.\\nNonetheless, that was the repertoire.\\nThey would mate.\\nShe would stimulate these\\nventromedial hypothalamus neurons.\\nThe male mouse would\\nimmediately try and attack\\nand kill the female mouse.\\nAnd then she would stop the stimulation\\nand he would stop trying\\nto attack and kill\\nthe female mouse, return\\nto the attempt, at least,\\nto mate with the female mouse.\\nThese are such dramatic shifts in behavior\\ntriggered only by the\\nactivation of only the small set\\nof neurons within the\\nventromedial hypothalamus.\\nAnd for those of you that think\\nthat you can watch this sort of thing\\nwithout being disturbed, I\\nencourage you to go to YouTube.\\nWe will provide a link\\nwhere you can see a video\\nof this type of behavior.\\nIt's incredibly dramatic.\\nThe shift in behavior\\nis almost instantaneous,\\noccurs within seconds,\\nif not milliseconds,\\nthousandths of a second.\\nThe next experiment that she\\ndid was to put a male mouse\\nwith this stimulation\\nwith light capability\\nin its ventromedial\\nhypothalamus into a cage alone,\\nbut with a rubber glove\\nfilled with air or water.\\nMouse, walking around sniffing, peeing,\\nwhich is what male mice seem to do.\\nThey seem to urinate\\neverywhere, that's actually\\nan interesting, perhaps\\ninteresting feature of male mice\\nand actually many male\\nanimals, perhaps even humans.\\nWe don't know, or maybe we do know,\\nbasically this has been an\\nobserved time and time again\\nin experiments, mainly\\nby Lisa Stowers's lab\\nat the Scripps Institute,\\nthat's characterized this.\\nIf you put female mice\\ninto an arena or a cage,\\nthey always urinate in a very\\nsmall corner of that cage.\\nWhereas if you put mail mice\\ninto an arena or a cage,\\nthe urinate everywhere,\\nthey have this obsession\\nwith spraying their urine everywhere,\\nyou can transpose that to\\nhuman behavior if you like.\\nIn any event, Dayu put the\\nmouse in the cage alone,\\nbut with this rubber glove,\\nthe mouse is walking around\\nurinating, et cetera,\\ndoing whatever is that mice do,\\nthen she stimulates the activation\\nof these ventromedial\\nhypothalamus neurons,\\nand the mouse immediately\\ntries to kill the glove.\\nIt goes into a rage, attacking the glove\\nas if it were another mouse\\nor some other animate object.\\nBut of course it's an inanimate object.\\nIt's just a rubber glove.\\nShe stops the stimulation and the mouse\\nimmediately goes back\\nto being completely calm\\nor at least not attacking.\\nAgain, we don't know what\\nthe mouse was feeling.\\nSo these are very dramatic videos.\\nAgain, you can see them\\nby following the link\\nthat we'll provide in the caption.\\nIf that sort of thing\\nis going to disturb you,\\nby to see, for instance, the attack,\\none mouse attacking another,\\nplease just don't watch them.\\nI'm not interested in traumatizing anybody\\nor you traumatizing yourself, that is.\\nA number of different variations\\nwere done on this experiment.\\nFor instance, stimulating\\nthe VMH in female mice,\\nas opposed to male mice,\\nputting the female mice\\nin with other female mice\\nor with other male mice,\\nno matter what variation\\none carries out, so it doesn't matter\\nif it's male with female, male with male,\\nfemale with female, et cetera,\\nstimulation of the\\nventromedial hypothalamus\\nin a male mouse or a female\\nmouse evokes this very dramatic,\\nalmost instantaneous aggressive behavior,\\nphysically aggressive behavior.\\nSubsequent experiments done by Dayu Lin\\nin her own laboratory\\nand other laboratories\\nhave shown that the ventromedial\\nhypothalamus connected\\nwith a bunch of other brain\\nareas that are interesting,\\nAnd I'll talk about some\\nof those in a little bit,\\nbut one of them that\\nI want to call out now\\nis the so-called PAG, the\\nperiaqueductal gray nucleus.\\nThis is a large structure\\nin the back of the brain\\nthat houses things like neurons\\nthat can create opioids.\\nWe all know of the opioid\\ncrisis, but these are neurons\\nthat can produce endogenous,\\nmeans made by the body,\\nchemicals that can cause pain relief.\\nYou could understand why that might occur\\nin a circuit for aggression, right?\\nEven if one is the aggressor, it's likely\\nthat they may incur some physical damage\\nand they'd want some pain relief.\\nThe PAG also is connected to a number\\nof neural circuits that eventually,\\nthrough several processing\\nstations, excuse me,\\narrive at things like the jaws.\\nAnd in fact, stimulation of\\nthe ventromedial hypothalamus\\ncan evoke biting and\\naggressive biting behavior.\\nNow aggressive biting behavior\\nis particularly interesting\\nbecause in humans and\\nespecially in human children,\\nbiting is something that,\\nwhile young children might do\\nas a form of aggression,\\ntends to disappear\\npretty early in childhood.\\nAnd if it doesn't, it's often\\nseen as a mark of pathology.\\nI have a story about this,\\nactually, when I was a kid,\\nI went to a summer sports camp\\nand I'll never forget this,\\nso we're playing soccer and\\nin a rare stroke of luck\\nor accident, I happened to score a goal.\\nI wasn't a particularly\\ngood soccer player,\\nespecially not at that stage of my life.\\nThey later figured out\\nthat it was just better\\nto make me a fullback, 'cause\\nI could just wait there\\nand do what fullbacks do.\\nI was better at taking\\nthe ball or the person out\\nthan I was putting the ball in the goal.\\nNonetheless, I, again,\\nby chance, scored a goal\\nand I was trotting back\\nto my side of the field,\\nand all of a sudden I felt\\nthis sting in my back,\\na kid, not to be named, although\\nI do remember your name,\\nI'm not going to tell\\nyou what his name was.\\nA kid jumped on my back and\\nbit me on the top of my back.\\nAnd this of course resulted\\nin a discussion and a timeout\\nand all the usual things and\\nparents I think got involved.\\nI don't recall, I didn't\\nthink much else of it,\\nbut I recall that this was\\nconsidered especially troubling\\nbehavior because he bit\\nme as opposed to hit me\\nor shoved me down or something that sort,\\nand it does seem as if\\nthe tendency to use biting\\nas an aggressive behavior is associated\\nwith a more primitive circuitry.\\nNow here I'm truly anthropomorphizing.\\nI don't know what this other\\nkid happened to be thinking\\nor feeling at the time, how could I?\\nAnd I certainly am not going to say\\nthat biting in every case\\nreflects a pathology,\\nalthough I think there\\nis general agreement\\nin the psychology community,\\nin the psychiatric community\\nthat past a certain age,\\nthe using of one's teeth to\\nimpart aggression and damage\\non others is a particularly\\nprimitive and troubling\\nor at least for the observer\\nor the person experiencing\\nis a pretty disturbing event.\\nDayu's lab has shown that activation\\nof the ventromedial hypothalamus triggers\\na downstream circuit in\\nthe periaqueductal gray\\nwhich then triggers a whole\\nother set of circuits of fixed\\naction patterns.\\nHere we are back to Lorenz\\nwith fixed action patterns,\\nincluding swinging of the\\nlimbs, right punching.\\nAnd this wouldn't necessarily\\nbe controlled punching,\\nbut also biting behavior.\\nSo it's remarkable to me,\\nat least that we have circuits\\nin our brain that can evoke\\nviolent use of things like\\nour mouth or violent use of\\nthings like our limbs.\\nThat of course could be used\\nfor things like singing or\\nkissing or eating or, you know,\\ngesticulating in any kind\\nof polite or impolite way.\\nThe point here is that neural circuits,\\nnot individual brain areas\\nevoke the constellation\\nof behaviors that we call aggression.\\nNow, many of you are probably\\npuzzled or at least should be\\nbecause I've been talking about\\nthis highly specialized brain area,\\nthe ventromedial hypothalamus\\nand this highly specialized\\nsubcategory of neurons in the\\nventromedial hypothalamus,\\nthese neurons that make\\nestrogen receptors.\\nAnd yet the activation of those cells\\ntriggers dramatic and\\nimmediate aggression,\\nboth in males and in females and both\\nagainst males and against females.\\nSo what's going on here?\\nMost of us think about\\nestrogen and we don't\\nimmediately think of aggression.\\nMost of us hear testosterone and we might\\nthink about aggression,\\nalthough other things as well.\\nIn order to understand this, I\\njust want to briefly refer back\\nto a conversation that I had\\non a previous episode of\\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast.\\nAnd that was with my colleague,\\nthe great Robert Sapolsky\\nof course, is a professor at Stanford\\nwho studied testosterone\\nand its impacts on behavior\\nas well as estrogen and other hormones\\nand their impacts on behavior.\\nTo make a long story short and to dispel\\na still unfortunately very common myth.\\nTestosterone does not\\nincrease aggressiveness,\\ntestosterone increases\\nproactivity and the willingness\\nto lean into effort in\\ncompetitive scenarios.\\nSometimes this is referred to\\nas the challenge hypothesis,\\nbut to make a long story short,\\nif people are given testosterone,\\nor if you look at people\\nwho have different levels,\\nexcuse me, of testosterone,\\nendogenously that they naturally make.\\nWhat you'll find is that\\ntestosterone tends to increase\\ncompetitiveness, but not\\njust in aggressive scenarios.\\nSo if somebody is already aggressive,\\ngiving them testosterone\\nwill have the tendency\\nto make them more aggressive.\\nIf somebody however is very\\nbenevolent and altruistic,\\ngiving them testosterone will\\nmake them more benevolent\\nand altruistic, at least up to a point.\\nNow, of course there are certain forms\\nof synthetic testosterones that\\nare known in sports circles\\nand in other circles to\\nincrease aggressiveness\\nbecause of the way those particular forms\\nof synthetic testosterones work.\\nBut in general, most of the experiments\\nthat I'm referring to have\\nnot been done using those,\\nthey've been done using\\nthe let's call them\\nthe more traditional biological\\nforms of testosterone\\nor that resemble the biological\\nforms of testosterone.\\nIn fact, Robert Sapolsky described\\na really interesting experiment in which,\\nif you look at testosterone\\nlevels or you administer\\nadditional testosterone to people\\nwho are doing philanthropy,\\ngiving money to organizations\\nand so they're essentially doing good\\nbecause these are\\norganizations doing good.\\nWhat you find is that\\nincreased testosterone\\nor further increasing\\ntestosterone makes people\\nmore willing to compete,\\nto give more money\\nthan the other person\\nin the room in order,\\nyou know, to put it in air quotes,\\n\\\"To Alpha out the other\\nperson,\\\" by giving more money.\\nSo this is an act of altruistic\\nor benevolent philanthropy.\\nIt is not an act of aggression.\\nOf course, we don't know what the people\\nare feeling underneath all that.\\nAgain, we can't\\nanthropomorphize or project\\nonto other people what they're feeling.\\nBut the point is that testosterone itself\\ndoes not make people more aggressive.\\nAnd in the experiments that\\nwe've been talking about\\nup until now, it's actually the activation\\nof estrogen receptor containing neurons\\nthat makes these animals more aggressive.\\nAnd it turns out there's\\nevidence that in certain context,\\nestrogen can make people more aggressive.\\nSo what's going on here?\\nWell, what's going on is that\\ntestosterone can be converted\\ninto estrogen through a\\nprocess called aromatization.\\nThere's an enzyme called aromatase.\\nAnytime you have word that ends in A-S-E,\\nat least if it's in\\nthe context of biology,\\nit's almost always not always,\\nbut almost always an enzyme.\\nSo the aromatase enzyme converts\\ntestosterone into estrogen,\\nand it is actually\\ntestosterone, aromatized,\\nconverted into estrogen and then binding\\nto these estrogen containing neurons\\nin the ventromedial hypothalamus\\nthat triggers aggression.\\nI want to repeat that, it\\nis not testosterone itself,\\nthat triggers aggression.\\nIt is testosterone aromatized\\ninto estrogen within the brain\\nand binding to these estrogen\\nreceptor containing neurons\\nin the ventromedial hypothalamus\\nthat evokes aggression\\nand dramatic aggression at that.\\nNow this effect of estrogen\\ncausing aggression in the brain\\nis very robust, so much so\\nthat if you take a mouse\\nthat lacks the aromatase enzyme or a human\\nthat lacks the aromatase\\nenzyme, and they do exist,\\nthen there is a reduction\\nin overall aggression,\\ndespite high levels of testosterone.\\nAnd if people who or mice who\\nhave the aromatase enzyme have\\nthat enzyme blocked, well,\\nthen it doesn't matter\\nhow much you increase testosterone\\nor any of its other derivatives.\\nYou do not observe this aggression.\\nSo this runs counter to\\neverything that we know and think\\nabout the role of testosterone.\\nAgain, testosterone\\nincreases competitiveness.\\nIt can increase the desire\\nto work under challenge.\\nI've said it before, and I ran this\\nor pressure tested this\\nagainst Robert Sapolsky\\nwho's been working on\\ntestosterone and it's role\\nin the brain and behavior\\nfor many decades now.\\nIt is fair to say that\\ntestosterone has the net effect\\nof making effort feel good,\\nor at least increasing\\nthe threshold at which effort\\nfeels bad or unsustainable.\\nAnd it does that by way\\nof changing the activity\\nor the threshold for\\nactivation of brain structures,\\nlike the amygdala and\\nother brain structures\\nassociated with anxiety.\\nSo the next time somebody says,\\ntestosterone makes people aggressive.\\nYou can say, \\\"Ah, no,\\nactually it's estrogen\\nthat makes people aggressive,\\nand animals aggressive\\nfor that matter.\\nNow of course it is the\\ncase that because males\\nhave relatively less estrogen circulating\\nin their brain and body\\nthan females, right?\\nBecause they have testes, not ovaries,\\nthat testosterone is\\nrequired in the first place\\nin order to be converted into estrogen,\\nto activate this aggressive\\ncircuit involving\\nthese estrogen receptor containing neurons\\nin the ventromedial hypothalamus.\\nBut nonetheless, it is estrogen\\nthat is the final step.\\nIt is the hormone on\\nwhich aggression hinges.\\nAnd I think for most people,\\nthat's a quite surprising finding.\\nAnd yet this is perhaps one\\nof the more robust findings\\nin both the animal and human\\nliterature, as it relates\\nto hormones and psychological\\nstates and behavior.\\nNow, of course it is the case\\nthat if testosterone is low,\\nthat a person or an animal will exhibit\\nless aggressive behavior, but that's not\\nbecause of reduced testosterone per se.\\nIt's because of the subsequent\\nreduction in testosterone,\\nmeaning if there's no\\ntestosterone to aromatize\\ninto estrogen, estrogen\\nwill also be lower.\\nSo we've established that\\nit's not testosterone,\\nbut testosterone converted into estrogen\\nthat activates these\\ncircuits for aggression.\\nBut nonetheless, it's\\nstill surprising, right?\\nI mean, most of us don't\\nthink about estrogen\\nas the hormone that stimulates aggression,\\nbut it turns out it's all contextual.\\nThere are beautiful data\\nshowing that whether or not\\nestrogen stimulates aggression,\\ncan be powerfully modulated\\nby whether or not days are\\nshort or days are long.\\nIn other words, whether or not\\nhere's a lot of sunshine or not.\\nNow, obviously brain is encased in skull.\\nSo it doesn't really know\\nif there's a lot of sunshine\\nout there even though you can\\nsee the sun with your eyes,\\nyou can feel it on your skin.\\nDay length is converted\\ninto hormonal signals\\nand chemical signals\\nand the primary hormonal\\nand chemical signals involve\\nmelatonin and dopamine\\nand also the stress hormones.\\nSo to make a very long story short,\\nin the long days where\\nwe get a lot of sunlight,\\nboth in our eyes and on our skin,\\nmelatonin levels are reduced.\\nMelatonin is a hormone\\nthat tends to produce\\nstates of sleepiness and quiescence.\\nIt also tends to activate\\npathways that tend to reduce\\nthings like breeding and sexual behavior.\\nIn long days, dopamine is increased.\\nDopamine is a molecule associated\\nwith feelings of wellbeing\\nand motivation and the desire to seek out\\nall sorts of things, all\\nsorts of motivated behaviors.\\nAnd in long days provided\\nwe're getting enough sunlight\\non our skin and to our\\neyes, the stress hormones,\\nespecially cortisol, and some of the other\\nstress hormones are reduced in levels.\\nIf estrogen levels are\\nincreased experimentally\\nunder long day conditions,\\nit does not evoke aggression.\\nHowever, in short days,\\nif estrogen is increased,\\nthere's a heightened\\npredisposition for aggression.\\nAnd that makes perfect sense.\\nIf you think about what short days do\\nto the biology of your brain and body.\\nIn short days, the\\nmelatonin signal goes up.\\nThere's more melatonin circulating\\nfor more of each 24 hour cycle.\\nStress hormones are circulating more.\\nWhy? Short days tend to\\nbe associated with winter.\\nIn winter, we are bombarded\\nwith more bacterial viruses\\nbecause bacterial viruses actually survive\\nbetter in cold than they do in heat.\\nIn fact, in my laboratory, we work with\\na lot of viruses and\\nbacteria and when we want\\nto keep them alive, we\\nput them in the freezer.\\nIf we want to kill them, if\\nwe want to inoculate them,\\nwe put them under UV light.\\nLike you would see from the sunlight.\\nSo shorter days are\\nconducive to aggression.\\nNot because days are short per se,\\nbut because stress\\nhormone levels are higher\\nand because dopamine levels are lower.\\nNow, here's where all of\\nthis starts to converge\\non a very clear biological picture,\\na very clear psychological\\npicture, and indeed\\na very clear set of tools that\\nwe can think about and use.\\nUnder conditions where cortisol is high,\\nwhere this stress hormone is\\nelevated and under conditions\\nwhere the neuromodulator\\nserotonin is reduced\\nthere is a greater propensity for estrogen\\nto trigger aggression.\\nNow, again, I know I've said it before,\\nbut for males who make\\na lot of testosterone\\nrelative to estrogen, you\\nhave to swap in your mind\\nthis idea that if testosterone is high,\\nthat means that estrogen is low because\\nwhile that can be true in\\nthe periphery in the body,\\nif testosterone is high,\\nthere is going to be\\nsome aromatization, that conversion of\\ntestosterone to estrogen.\\nSo anytime you hear that\\ntestosterone is high,\\nyou should think testosterone\\nis high in the body\\nand perhaps estrogen is low in the body.\\nBut that means that there's\\ngoing to be heightened levels\\nof estrogen in the brain and therefore\\nincreased propensity for aggression.\\nIn females who generally\\nmake less testosterone\\nrelative to estrogen, there\\nis sufficient estrogen\\nalready present to trigger aggression.\\nSo both males and females\\nare primed for aggression,\\nbut that's riding on a\\ncontext and that context\\nof whether or not you get a\\ntendency for aggression or not.\\ndepends on whether or not\\ncortisol is high or low,\\nand I'm telling you that if\\ncortisol is relatively higher\\nin any individual, there's\\ngoing to be a tilt,\\nan increase in that hydraulic\\npressure that Lorenz talked\\nabout toward aggression.\\nAnd if serotonin, the\\nneuromodulator that is associated\\nwith feelings of wellbeing and sometimes\\neven of slight passivity,\\nbut certainly of wellbeing,\\nif serotonin is low, there's\\nalso going to be a further shift\\ntowards an aggressive tendency.\\nSo if we return to Lorenz's\\nhydraulic pressure model\\nof aggression in other internal states,\\nwe realize that external\\nstimuli, things that we hear,\\nthings that we see, for instance,\\nsomeone saying something upsetting or us,\\nseeing somebody do something\\nthat we don't like to others\\nor to us, as well as our internal state,\\nour subjective feelings of wellbeing,\\nbut also our stress level,\\nour feelings of whether or\\nnot we have enough resources\\nand are content with what we have.\\nAll of that is converging on this thing\\nthat we call internal state and creating\\nthis pressure of either to be\\nmore aggressive or less aggressive.\\nAnd now we have some major players feeding\\ninto that final pathway.\\nThat question of whether or not\\nwill we hit the other,\\nperson, will we say the thing\\nthat is considered aggressive?\\nWill we not say it?\\nIf somebody says something\\nor does something\\naggressive to us, will\\nwe respond or will we be\\nsubmissive or even passive?\\nAgain, there are many things\\nfunneling into that question\\nand dictating whether\\nor not the answer is,\\n\\\"Absolutely I'll fight back,\\\"\\nor, \\\"I'm going to attack\\nthem even unprovoked.\\\"\\nOr if they say this, I'm going to do that,\\nor no matter what they do,\\nI'm not going to respond.\\nThese kinds of things are very complex.\\nAnd yet we really can boil them down\\nto just a few common elements.\\nAnd I'm telling you that those\\nelements are whether or not\\ncortisol levels are relatively\\nlower or relatively higher.\\nAgain, relatively higher is going to tend\\nto make people more reactive.\\nWhy?\\nBecause reactivity is really a function\\nof the autonomic nervous system,\\nwhich is sort of like a\\nseesaw that oscillates\\nbetween the so-called sympathetic arm\\nof the autonomic nervous system,\\nwhich tends to put us\\ninto a state of readiness\\nthrough the release of adrenaline.\\nCortisol and adrenaline\\nwhen they're circulating\\nthe brain and body, make\\nus more likely to move\\nand to react and to speak.\\nIt's actually what will induce\\na kind of low level tremor,\\nwhich is an anticipatory tremor to be able\\nto move more quickly, right?\\nA body in motion is more\\neasily set into further motion,\\nthat is, and the neuromodulator serotonin\\nis a neuromodulator that\\nin general is associated\\nwith feelings of wellbeing in response\\nto what we already have.\\nSo when we are well fed,\\nserotonin tends to be released\\nin our brain and body,\\nin particular, well\\nfed with carbohydrates,\\nthe precursor to serotonin is tryptophan.\\nAnd indeed there are nice studies\\nexploring the types of\\ndiets, nutritional programs\\nthat can reduce aggressive\\nbehavior, both in children\\nand in adults and tryptophan-rich diets\\nor supplementation with tryptophan.\\nSo for tryptophan rich diets,\\nthings like white turkey meat,\\nbut then there are also\\na number of carbohydrates\\nyou can look up.\\nIt's very easy to find foods\\nthat contain lots of tryptophan.\\nThose foods contain the\\nprecursor to serotonin.\\nNow it isn't simply the\\ncase that eating more foods\\nwith tryptophan will tend\\nto reduce your aggression.\\nI suppose it could do that,\\nif you ate it in abundance,\\nit could make you tired\\nand then you're less likely\\nto be aggressive, I don't\\nrecommend that strategy,\\nbut the idea here is that\\nwhen it's been explored,\\nincreasing levels of tryptophan\\neither by supplementation\\nor by food or drugs, prescription drugs\\nthat increase serotonin.\\nSo for instance, fluoxetine\\nsometimes called Prozac\\nor Zoloft or any number of the other SSRIs\\ntend to reduce aggressive behavior.\\nNow, not always, but in\\ngeneral, that's the case.\\nSimilarly, because elevated cortisol tends\\nto shift the whole\\nsystem, again, create more\\nof a hydraulic pressure\\ntowards aggressive states.\\nIf cortisol levels are\\nreduced, well then the tendency\\nfor aggressive behavior is reduced.\\nThis is supported by a number\\nof peer reviewed studies.\\nWe'll provide links to some of those\\nin the caption show notes.\\nAnd we're going to return to\\nthese a bit later in the context\\nof specific studies that have\\nlooked at genetic variants\\nin different individuals that cause them\\nto make more or less serotonin,\\nor at least to metabolize\\nserotonin differently.\\nThis is also the case for so-called\\nintermittent explosive disorder\\nthat can often be associated\\nwith gene variants that control\\nhow much serotonin is made\\nor how it's metabolized or\\nhow much cortisol is made\\nand how much it's metabolized.\\nIn thinking about tools\\nthat are a number of things\\nthat one could consider.\\nFirst of all, there are a\\nnumber of decent studies\\nexploring how supplementation\\nwith the Omega-3 fatty acids,\\nwhich are precursors of some\\nof the transmitter systems,\\nincluding serotonin that can\\nmodulate not directly mediate,\\nbut modulate mood and emotional\\ntone supplementation with\\nthe omega 3 S has been shown\\nto reduce impulsivity and\\naggressiveness in certain\\ncontexts in things like ADHD\\nor in individuals who\\nhave a predisposition\\nfor aggressive type behavior\\nor aggressive thinking.\\nNow that doesn't necessarily\\nmean that the omega 3\\nfatty acids are going directly\\nto the ventromedial hypothalamus\\nand changing the activity\\nof neurons there more likely they are\\ncausing or modulating\\nan overall shift in mood\\nthrough the immune system,\\nthrough hormone systems that are\\nchanging the overall tone or\\nthe propensity for neurons\\nin the ventromedial\\nhypothalamus to be activated.\\nHow much omega 3 fatty acid, what source?\\nWell, we've talked about\\nthis on the podcast before.\\nYou can, of course get omega 3 fatty acids\\nfrom a number of different foods.\\nGetting them from whole foods\\nis probably the best way\\nto do it, but many people,\\nincluding people with depression\\nwill often supplement\\nwith one gram or more\\nof omega 3 fatty acid per day.\\nSome people including myself\\nwill take them every day\\nas just a general mood enhancer.\\nI don't suffer from depression,\\nbut I've found it be\\nbeneficial for my health.\\nAnd so some people do that,\\nand I've talked about before,\\nhow in double blind\\nplacebo controlled studies,\\npeople taking one to three\\ngrams of omega 3 fatty acids\\nper day, typically in the form\\nof a high quality fish oil,\\nalthough there are other sources as well,\\nalgae and so forth, can\\nexperience improvements in mood\\nthat are on par with some of the SSRIs,\\nthe selective serotonin\\nreuptake inhibitors.\\nAnd of course, if you're\\nprescribed an SSRI\\nby your psychiatrist or other\\ndoctor, please do take that\\nand don't cease to take it\\njust simply to take omega 3s.\\nHowever you might mention to\\nthem, and you can find links\\nto the studies in our previous\\nepisodes on depression\\nthat supplementation\\nwith omega 3 fatty acids\\nof at this one gram or\\nmore of EPA specifically,\\nso getting above that one gram threshold,\\nas high as three grams per day\\nof the EPA has allowed people\\nto take lower doses of SSRIs\\nand still keep their mood\\nin a place that's beneficial for them.\\nAnd in terms of keeping cortisol\\nin a range that's healthy\\nand doesn't bias someone toward\\nhigh levels of aggression\\nand irritability, that's\\nagain, going to be set\\nby a number of larger\\nmodulators or contextual cues.\\nAnd I've talked about some\\nof those on the podcast,\\nbut I'll just briefly recap them now,\\nobviously getting sunlight in\\nyour eyes early in the day,\\nand as much sunlight as\\nyou safely can in your eyes\\nthroughout the day is\\ngoing to be important.\\nAgain, because of this effect\\nof estrogen in long days,\\nnot increasing aggression,\\nhowever, in shorter days,\\nestrogen increases aggression\\nbecause of the increase\\nin cortisol observed in short days.\\nAnother way to reduce cortisol\\nwas discussed in our episode\\non heat and the use of sauna\\nand heat, but also hot baths.\\nIt turns out that hot baths and sauna\\ncan be very beneficial\\nfor reducing cortisol.\\nAll the details on that are\\nincluded in the episode on heat\\nand it's timestamped, so\\nyou can go directly to that\\nif you want to learn\\nabout the temperatures\\nand the various durations,\\nbut to just give\\na synopsis of that, a 20\\nminute sauna at anywhere\\nfrom 80 to a hundred degrees\\nCelsius is going to be\\nbeneficial for reducing cortisol.\\nIf you don't have access to a sauna,\\nyou could do a hot bath,\\nadjust the temperature\\nso you don't burn yourself.\\nI think 80 to a hundred degrees Celsius\\nis going to be too hot for many people\\nif it's a hot bath, whereas\\nmany people who can't tolerate\\nthat hot bath can tolerate the sauna.\\nSo safety first always, and of course,\\nbut hot baths reduce cortisol,\\nhot saunas, reduce cortisol\\nof a duration about 20 or 30\\nminutes is going to be beneficial.\\nAnd of course, some of you\\nmay be interested in exploring\\nthe supplementation route and\\nfor reductions in cortisol,\\nreally the chief player\\nthere is ashwagandha,\\nwhich is known to decrease\\ncortisol, fairly potently.\\nI should just warn you\\nthat if you're going to use\\nashwagandha in order to\\nreduce cortisol, first of all,\\ncheck with your doctor\\nor healthcare provider\\nbefore adding or subtracting anything\\nfrom your supplementation\\nor health regimen.\\nOf course, I don't just\\nsay that to protect us.\\nI say that to protect you,\\nyou are responsible for your health,\\nwhat you take and what you don't take.\\nChronic supplementation with\\nashwagandha can have some\\nnot so great effects of disruption\\nof other hormone pathways\\nand neurotransmitter pathways.\\nSo the limit seems to be\\nabout two weeks of regular use\\nbefore you'd want to take\\na break of about two weeks.\\nSo ashwagandha again, a very\\npotent inhibitor of cortisol,\\nbut with some other effects as well,\\ndon't use it chronically\\nfor longer than two weeks.\\nBut if your goal is to reduce cortisol,\\nlet's say you're going\\nthrough a period of increased\\nirritability and aggressive tendency,\\nmaybe you're also not\\ngetting as much light\\nas you would like, and\\nperhaps also, if there are\\nother circumstantial\\nthings leading you towards\\nmore aggressiveness and\\nyour goal is to reduce\\naggressiveness, that can\\nbe potentially helpful.\\nAnd in light of all this stuff\\nabout cortisol and estrogen\\nand day length, I should\\nmention that there are in fact,\\nsome people who have a\\ngenetic predisposition\\nto be more irritable and aggressive,\\nand there are a couple of\\ndifferent gene pathways\\nassociated with this.\\nWe never like to think about just one gene\\ncausing a specific behavior.\\nThe way to think about genes\\nis that genes generally code\\nfor things within our biology.\\nIn the context of today's\\ndiscussion, things like\\nneural circuits or the\\namounts of neurotransmitters\\nthat are made, or the amounts\\nof hormones that are made,\\nor the amount of neurotransmitter\\nhormone receptors\\nor enzymes, et cetera,\\nthat shift the activity\\nof our biology in a particular direction.\\nThey bias our biology.\\nAnd in fact, there is a\\ngenetic variant present\\nin certain people that adjusts\\ntheir estrogen receptor sensitivity,\\nand that estrogen receptor\\nsensitivity can result\\nin increased levels of aggression,\\nsometimes dramatic increases, however,\\nand also very interestingly, photo period,\\nmeaning day length, is a strong\\nmodulator of whether or not\\nthat aggressiveness turns up or not.\\nWhether or not that person with\\nthe particular gene variant\\nis more aggressive or not,\\ndepends on how long the day is\\nand how long the night is.\\nOne particular study that\\nI like that references this\\nis Trainer, et al, the\\ntitle of the study is\\n\\\"Photo period reverses\\nthe effects of estrogens\\non male aggression, via genomic\\nand non-genomic pathways.\\\"\\nThis was a paper published\\nin the proceedings\\nof the National Academy of Sciences.\\nWe'll put a reference to\\nthis in the show notes,\\nif you'd like to explore it further,\\nbut it really points to the\\nfact that rarely, sometimes,\\nbut rarely, is it the\\ncase that just one gene\\nwill cause somebody to\\nbe hyper aggressive.\\nAlmost always there's\\ngoing to be an interplay\\nbetween genetics and environment\\nand as environment changes\\nsuch as day length changes and\\nthe length of night changes,\\nso too, will the tendency for people\\nwith a given genetic variant\\nto be more aggressive or not.\\nNow, of course, in the absence\\nof detailed genetic testing\\nfor this particular\\nestrogen receptor variant,\\nmost people, I'm guessing\\nyou, are probably\\nnot walking around knowing\\nthat you have this gene or not.\\nRegardless, I think it's\\nimportant to pay attention\\nto how you feel at\\ndifferent times of year,\\ndepending on whether or not summer,\\nwhether or not it's winter,\\nwhether or not you're\\ngetting sufficient sunlight,\\nmeaning viewing sufficient\\nsunlight or not,\\nwhether or not you're getting\\nsufficient sunlight exposure\\nto your skin or not, whether or not\\nyou're indoors all the time.\\nGenerally those things\\ncorrelate with season,\\nbut not always.\\nYou can go through long bouts of hard work\\nin the summer months when days are long,\\nbut you're indoors a lot and\\ngetting a lot of fluorescent\\nlight exposure late in the evening.\\nAnd perhaps that's when you're\\nfeeling more aggressive.\\nSo we have to be careful\\nabout drawing a one-to-one\\nrelationship between\\nany biological feature\\nand certainly psychological\\nor behavioral feature\\nlike aggressiveness, but\\nit's, I believe, helpful\\nto know that these genetic biases exist,\\nhow they play out again,\\nthey shift our biology\\nin a general thematic direction.\\nThey don't change one thing.\\nThey change a variety of things\\nthat bias us toward or away\\nfrom certain psychological\\nand behavioral outcomes\\nand the various things that we can do\\nin order to offset them.\\nAnd we described those\\nearlier in terms of trying\\nto keep cortisol low by\\ngetting sufficient sunlight\\nregardless of time of year, and\\nregardless of whether or not\\nyou happen to have this\\nparticular genetic variant.\\nSo earlier I talked about\\nhow it is testosterone\\nconverted into estrogen\\nthat's activating aggression\\nin the ventromedial hypothalamus,\\nnot testosterone itself.\\nHowever, there are some\\nstudies carried out in humans\\nthat have evaluated the\\neffects of testosterone\\nand how levels of testosterone\\ncorrelate with aggressiveness\\nin the short term.\\nI'm just going to detail\\na few of those studies\\nbecause I think they are\\ninteresting and important.\\nFirst of all, there is a\\nstudy that has explored\\nlevels of testosterone in\\nmen of different professions.\\nNow, before I tell you the data,\\nI want to be very clear here,\\nwith a study such as this,\\none never knows whether or not these men\\nwent into a particular profession because\\nthey had a testosterone\\nlevel of a given value\\nor whether or not the work itself\\naltered their testosterone levels or both.\\nAnd I think it's fair to\\nassume that it's probably both.\\nSo be very careful in assuming\\nthat a given testosterone\\nlevel is causal for\\nchoosing a particular career\\nor that a particular career is causal\\nfor creating a particular\\ntestosterone level.\\nThis study used salivary\\ntestosterone levels\\nas the measure, which to\\nbe fair is not the best way\\nto measure testosterone.\\nTypically blood draw would be the best way\\nto measure testosterone,\\nbut nonetheless, provided\\nthe appropriate methods are\\nused, salivary testosterone\\ncan be a reasonable\\nmeasure of testosterone.\\nThe different occupations\\nthat were looked at were,\\nand here they just looked at\\nmen in this particular study\\nwere ministers, salesmen, they didn't say\\nwhat particular types\\nof salesmen, firemen,\\nprofessors, of all things,\\nphysicians and NFL players.\\nAnd what they discovered was\\nthat the testosterone levels\\nwere essentially in that\\norder from low to highest.\\nSo minister, salesman, fireman,\\nprofessor, physician, NFL player.\\nNow we could micro dissect\\nall the different stereotypes\\nand all the different features\\nof each of these jobs.\\nFor instance, we don't know\\nwhether or not the fact\\nthat the firemen happened,\\nat least in this study\\nto have lower testosterone\\nlevels on average\\nthan the professors or the physicians\\nwas because firemen have\\nlower testosterone levels\\nor because they have a\\nmuch more stressful job\\nand their cortisol levels\\nare higher than the professor\\nor the physician and cortisol\\nand testosterone, not always,\\nbut generally are in somewhat\\nantagonistic push-pull mode\\nbecause they derive from the\\nsame precursor, et cetera.\\nTypically, when cortisol is high,\\ntestosterone tends to\\nbe lower and vice versa.\\nSo we don't know what's\\ncausing these effects.\\nAnd again, this is just one\\nstudy and just six occupations,\\nbut I think it's relatively\\ninteresting given the fact\\nthat each of these professions\\ninvolves different levels\\nof competitiveness, right?\\nSo we don't necessarily\\njust want to think about\\nthe level of physical\\nexertion that's required,\\nbut also the level of\\ncompetitiveness because it's known\\nthat competitive interactions\\ncan cause increases\\nin testosterone, in\\nparticular, in the winners\\nof competitive interactions,\\na topic for a future podcast.\\nMeanwhile, studies that\\nhave analyzed also again,\\nsalivary testosterone in\\nprisoners, in this case,\\nfemale prisoners, so these\\nare incarcerated individuals,\\nhave looked at levels of testosterone\\naccording to whether or\\nnot the person committed\\na non-violent or a violent crime in order\\nto arrive in prison.\\nAnd higher levels of salivary\\ntestosterone were related\\nto those that had arrived in prison\\nbecause of conviction of a violent crime,\\nas opposed to a nonviolent crime.\\nLikewise, when they analyzed\\nprison rule violations,\\nso an indirect measure of\\naggressiveness, but in this case,\\nit was strongly associated\\nwith aggressiveness\\nbecause they knew what\\nthe violations were,\\nthey found were for\\nprisoners that had none,\\nno prison violations, prison\\nrule violations I should say,\\ntheir testosterone\\nlevels tended to be lower\\nthan the testosterone levels\\nof women that had some,\\neven one, or more aggressive\\nviolations of prison rules.\\nWe'll provide links to these\\nstudies in the show notes\\nif you'd like to go into them further,\\nobviously studies like\\nthis need to be taken\\nwith a grain of salt\\nbecause there are so many\\ndifferent factors, different\\nprisons have different degrees\\nof violence to begin with and\\ncompetitiveness to begin with.\\nBut just as a final pass\\nat examining the role\\nbetween testosterone and aggressiveness,\\nthere was a very interesting\\nstudy from Goetz, et al,\\nG-O-E-T-Z published in\\n2014, that looked at serum,\\nso in this case, blood\\nlevels of testosterone.\\n30 minutes after application\\nof a gel-based testosterone\\nthat goes transdermal\\nso that the testosterone\\ncan go very quickly into the bloodstream,\\nand then did brain imaging\\nto evaluate the activity\\nof neurons in the so-called\\ncorticomedial amygdala,\\nthe cortico, the medial\\namygdala is one of the areas\\nof the amygdala complex as we\\ncall it because it's complex,\\nit's got a lot of different nuclei,\\nyou know, know what nuclei\\nare, low clusters of neurons.\\nIt's got a lot of different\\nones, but that medial\\nand that cortico medial\\namygdala in particular,\\nis known to be associated with\\naggressive type behaviors.\\nIt's linked up with as part\\nof the larger circuit that\\nincludes the ventromedial\\nhypothalamus and other brain areas\\nthat we referred to\\nearlier, such as the PAG.\\nWhat is remarkable about this\\nstudy is that it showed that\\njust 30 minutes after\\napplication of this so-called\\nAndroGel, this testosterone that seeps\\ninto the bloodstream,\\nthere was a significant\\nincrease in of course, testosterone\\nand corticomedial amygdala activation.\\nSo testosterone can have acute effects,\\nimmediate effects on the\\npathways related to aggression.\\nAnd I think this is something\\nthat's not often discussed\\nbecause many of the\\neffects of steroid hormones\\nlike testosterone, and\\nestrogen are very slow acting.\\nIn fact, steroid hormones,\\nbecause they have a certain\\nbiochemical composition can actually pass\\nthrough the membranes of\\ncells, so the outside of a cell\\nand into the nucleus of the cell\\nand change gene expression in the cell,\\nyou think about puberty,\\nthe kid that goes home\\nfor the summer and then comes back\\nlooking completely different.\\nWell that's because of a\\nlot of genes got turned on\\nby steroid hormones like\\ntestosterone and estrogen,\\nbut the steroid hormones can also\\nhave very fast acting\\neffects and with testosterone\\nin particular, those can\\nbe remarkably fast acting\\nand one of the most apparent\\nand well documented fast acting\\neffects is this effect: the\\nability to activate cells within\\nthe amygdala, so you might say,\\n\\\"Well, I thought the amygdala\\nwas associated with fear?\\\"\\nWouldn't testosterone then cause fear? No.\\nTurns out that the amygdala\\nharbors, both cortisol,\\ncorticosteroid receptors\\nand testosterone receptors,\\nand they each adjust the activity\\nin the amygdala differently,\\nsuch that testosterone tends\\nto activate amygdala circuitry\\nfor inducing states of mind and body\\nthat are more action based\\nand indeed in animals\\nand in humans, testosterone\\napplication and activation\\nof this corticomedial amygdala pathway\\nwill make animals and\\nhumans lean into effort.\\nThis is why I say testosterone\\nmakes effort feel good,\\nor at least biases the organism\\ntoward leaning into challenge.\\nSo if you recall, there's not\\njust one type of aggression,\\nthere's reactive aggression,\\nwhich is triggered when one\\nis confronted with something\\nthat sometimes is inevitable, right?\\nOne needs to fight for their life\\nor for somebody else's life,\\nbut also proactive aggression\\nand proactive aggression\\ninvolves activation\\nof those go-pathways in the basal ganglia\\nand a leaning into effort to overcome\\nwhatever state one happens\\nto be in to begin with.\\nAnd so this is very important\\nbecause it points to the fact\\nthat yes, estrogen is\\nactivating aggression pathways\\nthat are in the ventromedial hypothalamus,\\nbut it's very likely the case\\nthat testosterone is acting\\nto accelerate or to bias\\nstates of mind and body\\ntoward those that will lead to aggression.\\nAgain, aggression is not\\nlike a switch, on and off.\\nIt's a process.\\nIt has a beginning, a middle and an end.\\nRemember that hydraulic pressure\\nthat Conrad Lorenz hypothesized?\\nWell, think of testosterone\\nas increasing the pressure\\ntoward an aggressive\\nepisode and then estrogen\\nactually triggering\\nthat aggressive episode\\nin the ventromedial hypothalamus.\\nSo if somebody tells\\nyou that testosterone,\\nendogenous or exogenous\\nmakes people aggressive,\\ntell them no, testosterone tends to make\\npeople lean into effort.\\nAnd if that effort\\ninvolves being aggressive,\\neither reactively aggressive\\nor proactively aggressive,\\nwell then it will indeed\\nlead to aggression.\\nBut the actual aggression\\nitself is triggered by estrogen,\\nnot testosterone.\\nNow, thus far, we really\\nhaven't talked too much\\nabout the social context\\nin which aggression occurs.\\nAnd that's because there\\nis a near infinite,\\nif not infinite number of variables\\nthat will determine that.\\nSo for instance, violent\\naggression is entirely appropriate\\nat a professional boxing match provided\\nit's occurring inside the ring and only\\nbetween the competitors\\nand within the bounds\\nof the rules of the sport, et cetera.\\nHowever, there are some\\nthings that tend to bias\\ncertain social context\\ntoward being more aggressive\\nor less aggressive and not\\nalways physical aggression.\\nAnd those generally come in two forms\\nthat many of you are familiar with,\\nwhich are alcohol and caffeine.\\nLet's discuss caffeine first.\\nWhy would caffeine increase\\naggressive impulsivity?\\nWell, the general effects of caffeine\\nare to increase autonomic arousal.\\nThe activity of the\\nso-called sympathetic arm\\nof the autonomic nervous system,\\nwhich is to put it very\\nmuch in plain language\\nit's the alertness arm\\nof your nervous system.\\nThat is, it creates a sense of readiness\\nin your brain and body and\\nit does so by activating\\nthe so-called sympathetic chain ganglia.\\nAgain, as I always remind people,\\nsimpa and sympathetic\\ndoes not mean sympathy.\\nSimpa means together, we're all at ones.\\nAnd caffeine tends to\\nbias our brain and body\\nto activate the sympathetic chain ganglia,\\nwhich run from about the base of your neck\\nuntil the top of your pelvis\\nand deploy a bunch of chemicals\\nthat jut out into the rest of your body,\\nactivate adrenaline release.\\nThere's a parallel increase in\\nof adrenaline in your brain,\\ncreating the state of\\nalertness and readiness.\\nThat state of alertness\\nand readiness can be\\nfor all sorts of things,\\nnot just aggression.\\nHowever when we are in\\na state of increased\\nsympathetic tone, meaning more alert,\\nsuch as after drinking caffeine,\\nwe will bias all those brain\\nand body systems, the hormones,\\nthe chemicals, et cetera that exist,\\ntoward action as opposed to inaction.\\nSo put simply, caffeine\\ncan increase impulsivity,\\nno surprise there.\\nOn the opposite end of things,\\nalcohol tends to decrease\\nactivity in the sympathetic\\narm of the autonomic\\nnervous system, tends to\\nmake us feel less alert.\\nNow, initially it can\\ncreate a state of alertness\\nbecause of its effects in\\ninhibiting the forebrain,\\nour forebrain prefrontal\\ncortex in particular\\nhas what's called top-down inhibition.\\nIt exerts a inhibitory\\nor a quieting effect\\non some of the circuits\\nof the hypothalamus,\\nsuch as the ventromedial hypothalamus.\\nThe way to conceptualize\\nthis is that your forebrain\\nis able to rationalize and think clearly\\nand to suppress behavior and\\nto engage the no-go pathways\\ntelling you, \\\"Don't say that mean thing.\\\"\\n\\\"Don't do that violent thing,\\\" et cetera.\\nAlcohol initially tends\\nto increase our level\\nof overall activity by\\nreducing inhibition,\\nnot just in that forebrain\\ncircuit, but in other circuits.\\nTends to make us more active.\\nWe tend to talk more\\nthan we normally would,\\nmove more than we normally would,\\nbut very shortly thereafter\\nstarts acting as a sedative\\nby way of reducing\\nactivity in the forebrain,\\nreleasing some of the\\ndeeper brain circuits\\nthat are involved in impulsivity,\\nbut also causing a\\nsomewhat sedative effect.\\nAnd then of course, as alcohol\\nlevels increase even further,\\npeople eventually will pass\\nout, blackout, et cetera.\\nSo what we've got with\\nalcohol and caffeine\\nis we've got two opposite\\nends of the spectrum,\\ncaffeine increasing arousal and readiness,\\nand the tendency for impulsivity\\nand alcohol also increasing\\nimpulsivity, but through\\na different mechanism.\\nA really interesting study,\\nand I should just mention\\nthat the title of the study is,\\n\\\"Caffeinated and\\nnon-caffeinated alcohol use\\nand indirect aggression at the\\nimpact of self-regulation.\\\"\\nSo the title is almost self-explanatory.\\nThis was a paper published\\nin the Journal of Addictive\\nBehavior in 2016, examining\\nhow ingestion of alcohol\\nthat's either caffeinated\\nor non-decaffeinated\\nalcohol drinks impacted what\\nthey call indirect aggression.\\nAnd just to remind you what\\nindirect aggression is,\\nthese are not physical acts of aggression.\\nThese are verbal acts of aggression,\\nso embarrassing others or otherwise,\\nsomehow trying to reduce\\nthe wellbeing of others\\nby saying certain things\\nin particular in groups,\\nthis study examined\\nboth males and females.\\nThis was done on by way\\nof a college campus study,\\nsubjects were 18 to 47 years old.\\nI guess there's some older\\nstudents on that campus,\\nor maybe they use some\\nnon-students, but you know,\\nthese days you've also got some students\\nthat are in their thirties and forties.\\nSo they have a fairly broad\\nswath of subjects included,\\nfairly broad racial\\nbackground as well, included,\\nnot at equal numbers, but\\nat least they included\\na pretty broad spectrum of people\\nwith different backgrounds.\\nThey looked in particular\\npeople that ingested\\nnon-caffeinated alcohol\\ndrinks at a frequency\\nof 9.18 drinks per week, okay.\\nAgain, there's a college campus,\\nnot that I encourage that.\\nI'm one of these people that I don't,\\nI've never really liked drugs or alcohol\\nand sort fortunate in that\\nway I can drink or not drink\\nand tend to not drink.\\nBut so to me, 9.18, drinks\\nper week sounds like a lot,\\nbut I know for some people\\nthat might actually be typical.\\nAnd then others who are drinking at least\\none caffeinated alcoholic\\nbeverage per week.\\nAnd those individuals end as high,\\nI should say as 7.87 caffeinated\\nalcohol beverages per week.\\nSo this would be energy drinks combined,\\ntypically with hard alcohol,\\nthat's fairly commonly\\navailable in bars and so forth.\\nAnd some individuals\\ndrank as much as goodness,\\n20.36 alcoholic drinks per week, total,\\nsome that were caffeinated,\\nsome that were not caffeinated.\\nThe basic outcome of this study was that\\nthe more alcohol someone\\ntended to consume,\\nthe more likely it was\\nthat they would engage\\nin these indirect\\naggressive type behaviors.\\nAnd in terms of the caffeinated\\nalcoholic beverages,\\nthere, the effect was\\nespecially interesting.\\nHere I'm just going to\\nparaphrase or I'll actually\\nread from the study, quote,\\n\\\"With regard to caffeinated\\nalcoholic beverage use,\\nour findings indicated\\nthat heavier caffeinated\\nalcohol beverage use\\nwas associated positively\\nwith indirect aggression,\\neven after considering\\none's typical alcohol use\\nand dispositional aggression.\\\"\\nWhat this means is that\\neven though alcohol\\ncan bias certain individuals\\nto be more aggressive,\\nand even though certain\\nindividuals already have\\na disposition toward\\nbeing more aggressive,\\nthere was an effect that was independent,\\nmeaning above and beyond both\\nalcohol and a predisposition,\\nmeaning if someone was consuming\\ncaffeinated alcoholic beverages, they had\\na particularly high likelihood of engaging\\nin indirect aggressive behavior.\\nNow this makes perfect\\nsense in light of the model\\nthey propose, which is\\nthis self-regulation model,\\nthat basically self-regulation\\ninvolves several things.\\nIt involves engaging in certain behaviors\\nand suppressing other behaviors.\\nSo as described before,\\nbecause alcohol tends to have\\na sedative suppressive\\neffect on the autonomic\\nnervous system, at least\\nafter the initial period,\\nit's going to tend to\\nreduce the likelihood\\nthat people will engage\\nin any type of behavior.\\nWhereas caffeine will\\nincrease autonomic arousal\\nand increase the likelihood\\nthat someone will engage\\nin a particular type of behavior,\\naggressive or otherwise.\\nSo the combination of caffeine\\nand alcohol is really acting\\nas a two prong system\\nto bias people towards\\nmore impulsivity that\\nis less self-regulation.\\nSo it's really yanking\\nyour volitional control,\\nyour ability to engage in\\nprefrontal top down inhibition\\nover your hypothalamus from two distinct\\nand specific circuits.\\nBy now, you should be\\ngetting the impression\\nthat self-regulation is a key feature\\nof whether or not\\nsomebody, maybe even you,\\nis going to engage in aggressive speech\\nor aggressive behavior.\\nAnd we've talked about a number\\nof tools that one can use\\nto reduce the probability\\nthat that will happen.\\nI suppose, if the\\ncontext were appropriate,\\nyou could even take those\\ntool recommendations\\nand just invert them and\\nincrease the likelihood\\nthat aggressiveness would happen.\\nBut regardless, self-regulation is key.\\nAnd in light of that, I want\\nto share with you a study\\nthat's focused on kids, but\\nthat has important ramifications\\nfor adults as well.\\nAs you probably are already\\naware there are many kids\\nout there that suffer from so-called\\nattention deficit\\nhyperactivity, disorder, ADHD.\\nThere are also many adults we are finding\\nthat are suffering from ADHD.\\nAnd there's also an epidemic\\nI would say of people\\nthat are concerned about\\nwhether or not they have ADHD.\\nNow whether or not they have true,\\nclinical ADHD or not, is not clear.\\nWe did an episode all about\\nADHD and tools for ADHD.\\nI would encourage you to\\ncheck out that episode\\nand some of the diagnostic criteria.\\nIf you have the opportunity you\\ncan find at hubermanlab.com,\\nas this study I'm about to\\nshare with you aptly points out,\\nthere is no objective\\ndiagnostic marker of ADHD.\\nThere's no biomarker or blood\\ndraw or blood test for ADHD,\\nwhether or not one has ADHD\\ndepends on their performance\\non a number of different cognitive tests\\nand behavioral tests and self report.\\nIn any event, the study\\nI'm about to share with you\\nexplored how a particular\\npattern of supplementation\\nin kids with ADHD was able\\nto reduce aggressive episodes\\nand impulsivity and\\nincreased self-regulation.\\nAnd the title of the study is,\\n\\\"Efficacy of carnitine in\\nthe treatment of children\\nwith attention deficit,\\nhyperactivity disorder.\\\"\\nEven though they put\\ncarnitine in the title,\\nthat what they focused\\non was whether or not\\nacetyl-L-carnitine\\nsupplementation could somehow\\nadjust the behavioral tendency\\nof these kids with ADHD\\nand to make a long story\\nshort, indeed it did.\\nThere was a very significant\\neffect of acetyl L-carnitine\\nsupplementation on improving\\nsome of the symptomology,\\nexcuse me, of ADHD.\\nA few details about this study\\nthat might be relevant to you.\\nThis was a randomized double\\nblind placebo controlled double\\ncrossover study, this was\\ndone as an outpatient study.\\nSo the kids weren't in a hospital,\\nthey were living out in the world.\\nThis again was done on younger kids.\\nSo this was six to six to 13 year old kids\\nthat were diagnosed with ADHD.\\nThey received either acetyl\\nL-carnitine or placebo,\\nand they did all the good practice stuff\\nthat good researchers do of making sure\\nthat the placebo and\\nthe acetyl L-carnitine\\nhad similar look and taste.\\nIt was consumed twice daily after meals.\\nI should just mentioned\\nthat acetyl L-carnitine\\ntypically is taken in\\ncapsule form or occasionally\\nan injectable form.\\nHere, they they were\\nusing this as a drink,\\nwhich essentially the\\nsame as capsule form,\\nbut the powders just\\ngoing directly into liquid\\nand the carnitine dosage was\\n100 milligrams per kilogram.\\nSo they're doing this\\naccording to the body weight\\nof these kids with a maximum\\ndosage of four grams per day,\\nthe quantity of the\\nmedication was supplied here.\\nI'm reading for a period of\\neight weeks and every eight\\nweeks a new quantity of\\nmedication was supplied.\\nSo basically this is a\\nfairly long term study,\\nexploring behavioral outcomes\\nand psychological outcomes\\nin week eight, 16 and 24.\\nThey also looked at blood\\nthings that you could only get\\nthrough a blood draw, so things\\nlike hemoglobin, hematocrit,\\nred blood cell count, white\\nblood cell count, et cetera,\\nthey, these are kids and\\neven if it were adults,\\nthey were quite appropriately examining\\na lot of the physiological measures\\nthat one would want to\\ncarry out to make sure,\\nfirst of all, that blood levels\\nof carnitine are increasing.\\nAnd indeed they confirmed\\nthat, but also that\\nno negative effects are\\nshowing up in the physiology\\nas well as the psychology of these kids.\\nSo, first I'll just tell you\\nthe basic outcome of the study,\\nwhich was, here I'm paraphrasing,\\n\\\"Here, given twice\\ndaily, carnitine appeared\\nto be effective and well tolerated\\ntreatment for a group\\nof children with ADHD.\\\"\\n\\\"They showed significant,\\nthe abnormal behavior\\ncompared to these other boys.\\\"\\nAnd now I'm moving to\\nthe table of results.\\nThey showed significant reductions\\nin their so-called \\\"Total Problem Score.\\\"\\nThe total problem score is\\na well-established measure\\nof behavioral problems in kids with ADHD.\\nAnd I should say adults with ADHD,\\nhas to do with challenges\\nin social and learning\\nenvironments and how well or poorly\\nan individual tends to perform.\\nReductions in intentional\\nproblems, overall reductions\\nin delinquency, and most important\\nfor sake of today's discussion,\\nsignificant reductions\\nin aggressive behavior.\\nNow what's especially nice\\nabout this study, I think,\\nis that even though it's\\na relatively small number\\nof subjects and certainly\\nneeds to be repeated\\nin other studies and other laboratories,\\nthat they were able to confirm\\nthe shifts in L-carnitine\\nwithin the bloodstream of these kids,\\nthat is they were able to\\ncorrelate the physiology\\nwith the psychological\\nchanges, in studies like this.\\nAnd frankly in all studies\\nof human pharmacology,\\nyou have to worry about\\neffects that show up,\\nnot just because of placebo effects,\\nbut because of so-called\\noff target effects\\nor related things, totally\\nindependent of the drug\\nor the particular\\nsupplement that you happen\\nto be looking at,\\nto put in the words of\\na great neuroscientist.\\nUnfortunately, he passed\\naway some years ago,\\nbut he was a member of\\nthe national academy,\\nextremely accomplished\\nneuroscientist once turned to me\\nand said, \\\"Never forget\\na drug is a substance\\nthat when injected into\\nan animal or a human being\\ncreates a paper,\\\" meaning you\\ncan see effects of pretty much\\nany drug or any supplement\\nin most all conditions.\\nHowever, it is in cases\\nsuch as this study,\\nwhere you can quite convincingly\\nsee that the particular\\nfeature of physiology that\\nyou expected to change,\\nactually changed.\\nAnd you see a psychological outcome\\nthat you can gain much greater\\nconfidence that the changes\\nin delinquency, in this\\ncase reduced delinquency,\\nimproved attention, reduced\\naggressiveness and so forth\\nwas at least somehow related to the shift\\nin blood physiology and\\nlevels of L-carnitine\\nor acetyl L-carnitine and\\ncarnitine in the bloodstream\\nof these children, as\\nopposed to something else\\nlike L-carnitine going and\\naffecting some downstream target\\nthat you have no knowledge of.\\nNow, of course that's\\nstill entirely possible,\\nbut I think studies such as\\nthese increase our confidence\\nthat things like L-carnitine can be used\\nperhaps in concert with things\\nlike omega 3 supplementation,\\ndiets that are biased towards\\nincreasing more tryptophan\\nand therefore more serotonin,\\nobviously avoiding things like alcohol\\nand as it appears from the\\nstudy I just described,\\nreducing one's intake or not consuming\\nany caffeinated alcoholic\\nbeverages seems like\\nit would be a good idea if your goal is\\nto reduce aggressiveness, to\\nthink about the hormone context\\nand whether or not you tend\\nto have higher testosterone,\\nan estrogen or lower\\ntestosterone, an estrogen,\\nmaybe even think about\\nthe work environment,\\nwhether or not you are\\nexisting in a particularly\\ncompetitive work environment\\nand even day life,\\ntime of year and whether or not\\nyou're getting sufficient\\nsunlight, whether or not\\nyou're avoiding light in\\nthe evening and so on.\\nSo studies such as this I think are useful\\nbecause they point to the fact\\nthat very seldom, if ever,\\nwill there be one supplement\\nor one nutritional change\\nor even one behavioral change,\\nthat's going to completely\\nshift in individual\\nfrom being aggressive and impulsive,\\nbut rather that by combining\\ndifferent behavioral regimens,\\nby paying attention to\\nthings like time of year\\nand work conditions and school conditions\\nand overall levels of\\nstress and likely therefore\\nlevels of cortisol, et cetera,\\nthat you can use behaviors,\\ndiet, and supplementation\\nas a way to shift that overall\\ninternal milieu from one\\nof providing a lot of\\ninternal hydraulic pressure\\nas it's been called throughout the episode\\ntoward aggressive impulsivity and relax\\nsome of that hydraulic pressure\\nand reduce aggressive tendencies.\\nSo once again, and frankly, as always,\\nwe've done a deep dive\\ninto the neurobiology\\nand the psychology of what I believe to be\\nan important feature of our\\nlives, in this case aggression.\\nI want to point out that in a episode\\nin the not too distant future,\\nI'm going to be hosting\\nDr. Professor David Anderson\\nfrom Caltech University,\\nwho is the world expert on the\\nneurobiology of aggression.\\nIn fact, he is the senior\\nauthor on many of the studies\\nrelated to the ventromedial hypothalamus\\nthat I discussed today.\\nOur discussion will touch\\non aggression, of course.\\nSo hearing today's episode will help you\\ndigest that information, but\\nwe are also going to talk\\nabout other emotional states.\\nHe is an expert, not just in aggression,\\nbut in motivated states related\\nto sex and mating behavior,\\nsocial relationships of all\\nkinds and how those relate,\\nnot just to biology and psychology,\\nbut also certain forms of pathology,\\nthings like PTSD and the\\nrelationship for instance,\\nbetween anger, fear,\\nanxiety, and depression,\\nand many other important\\ntopics that I know many of you,\\nif not all of you will be interested in.\\nIn the meantime, I want to point you\\nto his recently released\\nand wonderful book entitled,\\n\\\"The Nature of the Beast,\\nHow Emotions Guide Us.\\\"\\nAnd again, the author is\\nDavid Anderson from Caltech.\\nThis is a wonderful book.\\nIt serves as a tremendous introduction\\nto the history of the\\nstudy of these areas,\\nthe current science and\\ndiscoveries being made\\nin these areas, all made\\naccessible to the scientist\\nand non-scientist alike.\\nIt's a very engaging read and so much so\\nthat even though he was\\ngracious in sending me a copy,\\nI also purchased myself a\\ncopy to give to somebody\\nwho is a therapist, and\\nI've purchased another copy\\nto give to a high school kid that I mentor\\nbecause he's very interested\\nin the neuroscience of emotions.\\nAnd I think we are all\\ninterested in emotions,\\nnot just fear and some\\nof these negative states,\\nnot just aggression, but\\nalso the positive emotions\\nof our lives.\\nAnd so, \\\"The Nature of the\\nBeast, How Emotions Guide Us,\\\"\\nby David Anderson is a wonderful read.\\nI can't recommend it highly enough.\\nIf you're learning from and\\nor enjoying this

[MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today is an Ask Me Anything episode or AMA. This is part of our premium subscriber channel. Our premium subscriber channel was started in order to provide support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast, which comes out every Monday and is available at 0 cost to everybody on all standard feeds, YouTube, Apple, Spotify and elsewhere. We also started the premium channel as a way to generate support for exciting research being done at Stanford and elsewhere. Research on human beings that leads to important discoveries that assist mental health, physical health, and performance. I'm also pleased to inform you that for every dollar of the Huberman Lab Premium channel generates for research studies, the Tiny foundation has agreed to match that amount. So now we are able to double the total amount of funding given to studies of mental health, physical health, and human performance. If you'd like to subscribe to the Huberman Lab podcast Premium channel, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium. It is $10 a month to subscribe, or you can pay $100 all at once to get an entire 12-month subscription for a year. We also have a lifetime subscription model that is a one-time payment. And again, you can find that option at hubermanlab.com/premium.

And for those of you that are not Huberman Lab podcast premium subscribers, you can still hear the first 20 minutes of today's episode, and determine whether or not becoming a premium subscriber is for you. And now without further ado, I will answer your questions. And as always, I will strive to be as thorough as possible, as clear as possible, and as concise as possible. Our first question is about abstaining from thoughts. And in answering this question, we're going to skirt right up against a topic that I've covered before on the podcast which is obsessive compulsive disorder, which is a very serious disorder. I mean, it can have a range of severity, but people with true OCD suffer a lot from obsessions, these are intrusive thoughts, and compulsions, which are the behaviors typically associated with those thoughts. I think it's really important that we define OCD really clearly so that we can make sure that we're talking about intrusive thoughts and the desire to abstain from thoughts versus OCD and where there might be some overlap there. The functional definition of OCD that really pertains to the disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, OCD as opposed to we call people neurotic, or we say you have OCD, or I'm so OCD about this, or OCD about that, that's become a common use of the acronym OCD. But true OCD is a situation in which engaging in a particular compulsive behavior does not serve to reduce the intensity or the frequency of the obsessions. In fact, it makes it worse. So the typical thing that we hear these days is oh, you're so OCD, or he's so OCD, or she's so OCD, or I'm so OCD. Now if someone is OCD in that sense, OK, so not the clinical disorder but OCD in the sense that they're really clean, they're really fastidious, they need everything perfect. However, that person can achieve some level of calm and comfort that's fairly long lasting if everything's clean and perfect, well, then that's not obsessive compulsive disorder. This is really important to understand as we venture into answering the question about intrusive thoughts and the desire to abstain from certain thoughts. A person with true OCD will keep cleaning and cleaning, or washing their hands, or arranging things at perfect right angles, but the more they do it, the more their anxiety goes up. A person who has more typical, gosh, we don't really even have a language for this nowadays unfortunately, but the sort of person that's extremely particular, they need things a certain way, and they're very driven to resolve things and do things to make sure that things are done in a certain way, or handled in a certain way, well, if that person can experience relief from engaging in let's say, exercise, or from cleaning, you'd say you're so OCD about exercise. Well, but if exercising for an hour or even two hours in the morning make somebody really calm the rest of the day and they don't need to exercise well, then they're not necessarily true OCD. They don't necessarily have a disorder related to exercise. However, if they're exercising for two hours in the morning and then they find they can't concentrate on other things and their desire to exercise just increases and increases and becomes intrusive for them disrupting their quality of life throughout the day, well, then that's falling under the umbrella of what we would call a true disorder. So we want to highlight that because the question is about a desire to abstain from thoughts, and the question is, in your discussion with Dr. Anna Lembke-- and I should just mention Dr. Anna Lembke is the director of our Dual Diagnosis Addiction Clinic at Stanford University School of Medicine. She's the author of this incredible book Dopamine Nation that I think everybody should read. I do believe everyone should read that book. So important for the addict and nonaddict alike because it deals with basically the state of our life nowadays. We're living in this dopamine rich world where we can quickly become dopamine depleted, which is terrible, leads to depression in addition to things like addiction in some folks, et cetera. Anna was a guest on the podcast. You can find her episode at hubermanlab.com. Just put Anna. I think she's the only guest we've had thus far whose name is Anna, so it'll just pop up there. The entire website is searchable. But if you want to listen to that episode or watch that episode, you can access it hubermanlab.com. The question is in your discussion with Dr. Anna Lembke you were talking about abstaining from people's drug of choice for 30 days to reset the dopamine reward pathway. And indeed that is the prescriptive that Dr. Anna Lembke gives for most all addictions and for people that are suffering from milder even severe depression related to dopamine seeking behaviors, social media, video games, sex, food, et cetera. However, of course, in the instance of food or in some other addictions, you can't abstain for 30 days. That would be terrible to abstain for food for 30 days. I'm sure people have done it, but it is not healthy to do. Certain things like alcohol and drugs people can abstain for 30 days in efforts to never go back to them again. There are cases of severe alcohol or opiate dependence where people can't go cold turkey or they risk dying, so there they need to really work with a physician. But the 30-day reset of the dopamine system is something that's very real and that pertains to most people. That is it's going to be very effective for most people struggling with either behavioral, or what are sometimes called process addictions, or other types of addictions including substance abuse issues. The question continues. You said you were going to ask Ana how to abstain if your drug of choice is a thought or narrative as opposed to a substance or a behavior. The question continues, as far as I can tell, your discussion with Ana moved on before you asked her the question. Would you be able to discuss strategies for abstaining from addictive thoughts and narratives? OK. So let's talk about intrusive thoughts, and let's start off by asking ourselves, what is a thought? In the realm of neurobiology, we have sensations which are the processes by which our neurons, nerve cells convert light, photons, sound waves, touch, mechanical pressure, et cetera into electrical signals and chemical signals that head into our nervous system, including our brain. And then our brain, at least we think, make sense of them, and help us navigate the world that we're in. So the sensation part is a pure transformation of mechanical information, or in some cases, chemical information like smell. Literally, volatile chemicals floating around in the world are brought in through your nose and your neurons and your olfactory bulb convert those into electrical and chemical signals that your brain can understand. Perceptions are your idea of what those signals out in the world are. Either because you're paying attention to them, or for some other reason you decide that stop sign in front of you is red, and that the sign behind it is white, and that the sky is blue or cloudy, those are perceptions. So we have sensations and perceptions. Then we have emotions which are these things that include the mind and body that are related to neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, et cetera, although, those chemicals do other things as well. And then, of course, we have behaviors, actions. Everything from me moving my pen on a piece of paper to walking, running, et cetera. Thoughts are a fifth category of neural functioning that we really need to define, but that doesn't have as strict a definition as sensations, perceptions, or feeling, or action. But thoughts are real. We all know this. Thoughts are real, and one way that we can define thoughts is that thoughts are perceptions that include data from the past, present, or future, or combinations of past and present, or present and future, or future and past. I'm not trying to give an overly complicated definition here, but if we are going to answer a question about how to abstain from thoughts in a really direct and actionable way, we really need to address what our thoughts. So thoughts are perceptions that are generated internally. We don't need any external sensation in order to have a thought. We can close our eyes. We could be in sensory isolation for that matter. We could even be floating with no gravity, and we can have a thought. Thoughts tend to run pretty much automatically in the background all the time. Some people refer to this as chatter in the back of our minds in a very unstructured way. And then if we force our thoughts to be structured because we decide they need to be, or if something in our environment captures our perception, then our thoughts tend to be structured. Let me give you an example. If I'm just walking around, if there were a way in which we could broadcast my thoughts onto a screen, I hope we wouldn't do that. But those thoughts would be a mixture of semi-complete sentences and gibberish. However if somebody stops me, and says, hi. Good to see you. What are you doing today? And I start answering, well, then my thoughts are suddenly being driven by an external stimulus, their question, and some internal ideas, memory of who I am and what I'm doing that day so past and present, and so on. And so thoughts become structured. So when we have a question about how to abstain from thoughts, we need to be additionally specific and really pinpoint that what we're trying to do is to abstain from thoughts we don't want presumably, either because they are too repetitive and distracting, or because what's contained in those thoughts is disturbing. This is important because it gives us two answers to the questions that are highly divergent. One answer to the question of how to abstain from intrusive thoughts, thoughts that were addicted to, is if those thoughts are merely on loop all the time and we can't stop them, but the thoughts themselves aren't particularly disturbing. So think about a song you can't get out of your head, or you keep recounting some event, but the event itself isn't very disturbing. It's just intrusive because it's there. Well, in that case, the data really point to trying to anchor your thoughts to some external stimulus. So getting into action, getting into activities that really draw your attention away from that thought. Now you may still hear it scrolling in the background, so you might be sitting in class still hearing that loop of thoughts in the background. That's something that over time ought to wane, it ought to disappear if we try and bring more and more attention to whatever it is that's in our environment, whatever it is that we happen to be learning or doing physically, et cetera. Things like mindful meditation. Doing a 10 or even just 5 minute a day practice of sitting with eyes closed, or lying down with eyes closed and really focusing on one's breath, focusing one's attention on sometimes called the third eye center, but in science we'd say just the region right behind the forehead, you're directing your attention there, has been shown to increase focus for singular topics and can improve memory and do a bunch of other things as well. Those are data from Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab at New York University. She was a guest on the podcast as well. My laboratory has run studies on mindful meditation as well. So what you're really trying to do is learn how to focus better on one thing, and by focusing on that one thing, you focus off these repetitive thoughts. Now, I have a feeling that this question was asked and that many people upvoted this question because the issue isn't just thoughts that are intrusive because they're there and on repeat, but because the thoughts themselves are actually troubling. This could be recounting a trauma, someone harmed you, you observed something that was disturbing, you felt wronged, you felt someone else was wronged, you can't seem to get your mind off of something, and your emotions tend to follow, and so it's uncomfortable. I have a feeling this is the root of the question. In that case, the approach is very different. What we know from essentially all of the quality scientific and clinical studies is that those sorts of intrusive thoughts are very much like a trauma. Now we have to be clear in defining what trauma is. I'll use the definition that Dr. Paul Conti, another incredible guest that was on our podcast. A Stanford-Harvard trained psychiatrist. I think one of the world's foremost leaders on the issue of trauma and psychiatry and psychology generally. He defines trauma as an event or something that fundamentally changes the way that your nervous system works such that you function less adaptively going forward from that event. So not every bad occurrence in your life is a trauma. That's good news. The bad news is many people have traumas, and traumas change the way that our nervous system works so that we don't function as well as we could. So in that sense, intrusive thoughts that are disturbing are in many ways traumas and are reinforcing that trauma. Now, we know that almost counterintuitively in order to deal with trauma, you have to get very close to that trauma. You don't have to reexpose, and I would hope you would not reexpose yourself to the very same trauma. But we know that one of the best ways to deal with traumas is to get very clear about the narrative around those traumas. Now this can be done with a therapist ideally, but not everyone has access to therapy or can afford therapy. There's a range of quality of therapists for that matter, so we're always referring to the desire for people to do great therapy with really great, meaning excellently trained people. But it turns out that if you want to extinguish an intrusive thought, one of the best ways to do that is to journal about that particular thought extensively. So rather than the earlier strategy for intrusive thoughts where they're just on loop, and intrusive because they're on loop and present, but their content isn't disturbing, when that thought is disturbing and intrusive, we know that it's very useful to script out as much detail about that particular thought and the things around it as possible. Now obviously, you want to do this in a way that is fairly structured. So you ideally would use complete sentences. So the reason for doing that is that thoughts, as I mentioned earlier, can often be fragmentary. So they pop up in our mind almost we seemingly spontaneously. They're inhibiting our ability to focus, or be present at work, or family, or other things, or sleep. Writing things down in a lot of detail does seem to have this quality of both reducing the emotional load of whatever it is that thought is about, as well as diminishing the frequency of those intrusive thoughts over time. So this is far and away different than the strategy I mentioned for the other types of intrusive thoughts. And really it's far and away different from the 30-day abstinence approach that Dr. Anna Lembke was talking about for substance or behavioral addictions. Now, of course, this process of abstaining from thoughts or removing the addictive nature of certain thoughts can definitely take some time. So a good example there would be superstitions. I'll come clean here, and I've talked about this before on a few podcasts that when I was in college, I developed a knock on wood superstition. Any time I'd say something that I didn't want to happen or did want to happen, I'd say, knock on wood, and I'd knock on wood. And then I started suppressing the behavior mostly because it was a little embarrassing. And then I started just telling myself in my head, knock on wood, knock on wood, knock on wood. And it was clearly a little bit of an OCD type thing, but again, OCD in air quotes here. I think it qualified as OCD in the sense that the more I did it, the more I wanted to do it. So I needed to go cold turkey on the thinking, but how can you go cold turkey on a thought? You couldn't. What I was told to do and what worked very well for me was to just write down the worst possible outcome that I was concerned about. So to really get close to the nature or the underlying basis of that intrusive thought. And I raise this because a lot of times the intrusive thought is not, OK, I'm thinking about a car accident, or I'm thinking about a breakup, or I'm thinking about an exam that I have. That can be intrusive, but a lot of times it's some kind of nebulous, abstract, set of words, or ideas, or images around something that happened that we saw or heard or experienced. And by putting a lot of clear structure to what the thought is exactly and to putting some thought and structure onto paper about what that pattern of not healthy thinking relates to, people often achieve tremendous relief in a fairly short amount of time. Sometimes just in one session of writing it down, sometimes they need to write it down multiple times. What you're essentially trying to do with a intrusive thought or a trauma of any kind is you're trying to turn a disturbing story, that is a story that evokes a lot of emotion and captures, it hijacks your nervous system, into what is essentially a known but repetitive and old, boring story where the emotional load has been depleted. And there are, of course, I have to highlight the fact that getting sufficient rapid eye movement sleep we also know is very important for removing the emotional load of traumatic experiences and intrusive thoughts. So you really want to strive to get the best possible sleep you can. That includes sufficient rapid eye movement sleep. And we have multiple zero-cost resources for that at hubermanlab.com. We have the episode on mastery or sleep. We have the episode on perfecting your sleep. We have the toolkit for sleep. All of which are time stamped and all of which can be accessed to completely zero cost to try and get your sleep as good as possible, including lots of rapid eye movement sleep. So in order to remove intrusive and addictive thoughts, ask yourself, is this OCD of the classic sense? If it is, you should see a psychiatrist. They won't necessarily prescribe medication, but there are tools for true OCD that are very effective in many cases. And we did the episode on OCD which I invite you to listen to as well. You want to ask yourself, are the thoughts disturbing or merely intrusive and repetitive? If they're merely intrusive and repetitive, well, then learning to focus your attention on other things and getting better at focusing on single things through an exercise like mindfulness, meditation can really help. And indeed perhaps the best use of mindfulness meditation is to improve your level of focus. It does have other benefits as well, but that's going to be the major one that one will experience even with these very short 5 or 10-minute day meditations. Great data on that from the scientific literature. And then if those intrusive thoughts are not only intrusive but they're also disturbing, in that case, you really want to put as much structure and thought, believe it or not, into what those thoughts are really about. Write them out on paper in complete sentences and maybe do that multiple times until the underlying emotions related to those thoughts really start to diminish. And by doing that, you're essentially doing your own form of trauma therapy, for lack of a better way to put it. And again, the data really point to the fact that getting close to the specific details around those intrusive thoughts is going to be the best way to extinguish them. Thank you for joining for the beginning of this Ask Me Anything episode. To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these Ask Me Anything sessions, plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the Huberman Lab podcast standard channel and premium tools not released anywhere else, please go to hubermanlabs.com/premium Just to remind you why we launched the Huberman Lab podcast Premium channel it's really twofold. First of all, it's to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel which, of course, will still be continued to be released every Monday in full length. We are not going to change the format or anything about the standard Huberman Lab podcast. And to fund research, in particular research done on human beings. So not animal models but on human beings, which I think we all agree is the species that we are most interested in. And we are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance. And those protocols will be distributed through all channels. Not just the premium channel but through all channels, Huberman Lab podcast and other media channels. So the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth, and allow you the opportunity to support the research that provides those kinds of answers in the first place. Now an especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the Tiny Foundation has generously offered to do a dollar-for-dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel. So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science-related tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. If you'd like to sign up for the Huberman Lab Premium channel, again there's a cost of $10 per month, or you can pay $100 up front for the entire year. That will give you access to all the AMAs, you can ask questions and get answers to your questions, and you'll, of course, get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well. There will also be some premium content such as transcripts of the AMAs and various transcripts and protocols of Huberman Lab podcast episodes not found elsewhere. And again, you'll be supporting research for mental health, physical health, and performance. You can sign up for the premium channel by going to hubermanlab.com/premium. Again, that's hubermanlab.com/premium. And as always, thank you for your interest in science. [MUSIC PLAYING]\",\n          \"- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, we continue in our discussion about sensation or how we sense things. On previous episodes, we talked about sensing light and sound waves for things like vision and hearing. Today, we are going to talk about our sense of self or what's called interoception. Interoception is our sensing of our internal landscape, things like our heartbeat, our breathing, and our gut, how full our gut might happen to be, or how empty our gut might happen to be. But also our inner landscape with respect to chemistry, how acidic, or how good or bad we feel on the inside. This discussion about sense of self and interoception has many important, actionable items that relate to bodily health and brain health, and believe it or not, our ability to perform well or perform poorly in life. Indeed, it has profound influence on our rates of healing. So today we are going to talk about all the aspects of our inner landscape and how our brain and body communicate. And there will be many actionable protocols as we go along that discussion. Before we begin our discussion about sense of self, I want to highlight some very recently published research findings that I believe are immediately actionable and that everybody should be aware of. These are data that were published by my colleague, Justin Sonnenberg's laboratory at Stanford University School of Medicine, and the data were published in the Journal Cell, which is a very high stringency cell press journal. So phenomenal data. What this study showed was that individuals given a high fiber diet actually experienced less diversity of what's called the gut microbiome. The number of positive or health promoting bacteria in the gut was actually reduced by a high fiber diet, whereas individuals that ate just a couple of servings of fermented food each day, experience important and beneficial increases in anti-inflammatory markers. And that could be traced back to improvements in the gut microbiome diversity, the diversity of bugs, literally little bacteria that live in the gut, which might sound bad, but they are actually very health promoting. I'm going to get into all the details of this study later in the episode, but I just wanted to emphasize these findings because they are immediately actionable. I think for most people ingesting one or two servings of fermented food each day is reasonable and does not bring with it tremendous costs or tremendous inconvenience. And I think many people are ingesting high fiber diets thinking that that's the best way to improve their gut microbiome. So while these data may prove to be controversial among the folks out there in the nutrition community, that really high fiber diet, I want to just emphasize that these data were looked at in a very unbiased way. They were done with large scale screens of all sorts of inflammatory markers. There was no specific hypothesis going in. It was purely exploratory, but the data are very clear. It doesn't mean you shouldn't eat fiber doesn't mean that fiber is bad, but it really shows that eating fermented foods, just one or two servings a day, and maybe even ramping up to three or four servings per day can be very beneficial for many aspects of health. Before we go any further. I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford, it is however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Roka. Rocha makes sunglasses and eyeglasses that are of the absolutely highest quality. The company was founded by two All-American swimmers from Stanford and everything about their sunglasses and eyeglasses is developed with performance in mind. I've spent my career working on the visual system and its various functionings within the brain and within the eye, Roka sunglasses and eyeglasses are so phenomenal because they allow the visual system to do what it does best, which is to adjust to changes in what we call luminance or brightness, with many sunglasses out there and with many eyeglasses as well, if the brightness in the room changes or you get cloud cover, or you walk into a shadow, you have to take the glasses on or off, you can't see as well. But the folks at Roka really understand how the visual system works. And so they've designed their sunglasses and eyeglasses such that you never experienced that shift. You can walk into a shadow. The amount of sunlight can change. You can go into a dark room, et cetera, provided there's enough light to see you're going to see everything crystal clear. In addition you see everything crystal clear because the lens quality is terrific and the sunglasses and eyeglasses are very lightweight. So you don't even notice that they're on your face. Also the sunglasses and eyeglasses are designed for performance. You can use them while running or while cycling. Even if you sweat, they won't slip off your face. And as I mentioned before, they're very lightweight. So everything about these glasses is terrific and they have a terrific aesthetic. They have a lot of different styles to select from. And unlike a lot of performance eyeglasses out there, they won't make you look like a cyborg. You could wear them to dinner or to somebody's home. And they look really nice.

Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker. Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better meet your health goals. I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be assessed, can only be measured from a quality blood test. And now with the advent of quality DNA tests, you can get further insight into the status of your immediate and long term health. One of the problems with a lot of blood and DNA tests that are out there, however, is you get the numbers back, you get the levels of metabolic factors, hormones, et cetera, but you don't get any information about what to do with those numbers or how to actually shift them in the direction that you want to. With Inside Tracker, they have this very easy to use dashboard and that dashboard makes it very clear, not just what your levels of hormones, et cetera are, but what actions to take in terms of nutrition or exercise or other lifestyle factors to bring those numbers into the appropriate ranges for you. If you'd like to try inside tracker, you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman. And if you do that, you'll get 25% off any of Inside Trackers plans. Just use the code Huberman at checkout. That's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 25% off any of Inside Trackers plans. Today's podcast is also brought to us by Headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that's backed by 25 peer reviewed published studies and has over 600,000 five-star reviews. I started meditating when I was in my teens, but for many years I found it hard to maintain a meditation practice, I don't think I'm alone with that. I think many people start meditating. They'll do it for a few weeks or a few months, or maybe even a year. And then they'll give up the meditation practice. And we know from so many peer reviewed studies that meditation has a number of very positive effects on our brain health, our ability to focus and our bodily health. So it's a great thing, we probably should all be doing it, but most of us, including myself, have found it hard to stick to a meditation practice. Then I started using the Headspace app and what I found is I could be very consistent with my meditation practice because they have meditations that are short, meditation that are medium length, and meditations that are a bit longer, all of which benefit me. The meditations that they have also are of different styles. You can try different forms of meditation. I particularly like having a guide for my meditation. It just helps me stay focused, helps me stay on track and I'm able to derive all those regular benefits of meditation and keep the practice up on a regular basis, if you want to try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, you'll get a one month totally free trial. And with that, you'll get all of Headspace's meditations, the full library of meditations. You just go to headspace.com/special offer, and you get all of their meditations for one free month and you get to try it, if you don't like it, you can stop. But I think you will enjoy it. I certainly enjoy meditation and we know that it's very beneficial for all of us. If you're somebody who cares about your immediate and long-term health, and if you're somebody who's interested in performance of any kind in work in relationships, et cetera, today's topic I believe is among the more important ones for you. Of all the topics I could cover, this thing that we call sense of self, which is also called interoception has perhaps the most foundational level of importance for all that. We feel all that we do and all that we are capable of doing. In fact I will go so far as to say that interoception or our ability to sense our inner real estate is right there next to sleep. And perhaps one other feature of our health and bodily function that primary early determine how good we feel in the now in the short term, and in the longterm, and sets the stage for everything we are capable of doing. And if we don't take care of this thing that we call interoception, just like if we don't take care of sleep, we cannot perform well and we will not remain healthy. Interoception and sense of self are essentially the same thing, I will use those terms interchangeably, at least for sake of today's discussion. And I promise that if you can learn a little bit about the mechanisms of self sensing, of understanding what's going on in your internal milieu, as we say your internal environment, you will position yourself to do some very simple things that can lead to outsize positive effects on everything from sleep to body composition, to mental focus, to mood, your ability to regulate stress, and indeed even your ability to heal and recovery from injuries of different kinds, brain injury and bodily injury. So sense of self is absolutely crucial. It's sometimes called our sixth sense, right alongside the other five senses like hearing vision, touch, taste, smell, et cetera, but sense of self is different. Sense of self is really about what's going on internally within the confines of our skin. And it involves two key features that if you can understand those features, and you understand what modulates or changes, our ability to sense those features, there are a lot of things that you can do in terms of how you structure your nutritional practices, how you relate to your exercise practices, perhaps even certain things that you take in terms of supplementation that can basically make you feel better, more alert, and more capable for everything. I don't think that's a hyperbolic statement, I, in fact, I know it's not a hyperbolic statement because we have a system in our body that connects our brain to all of our bodily organs and connects all of those bodily organs to our brain. And that communication between brain and body in both directions creates a situation where either we are positioned to do things well, or we are positioned to do things poorly. So I really want to dive in and dissect, what is this system of brain, body communication? What does it look like? What are the actual neurons and connections? And as I do that, I promise that I'm going to place protocols, tools that you can apply in order to make sure that those neurons and connections are working optimally. So let's begin by talking about what system communicates the brain to the body and the body back to the brain. The system that's most often associated with this is our 10th cranial nerve called the vagus nerve. The word vagus relates to the word vagabond, which to wander, and indeed the vagus nerve is a vast, enormous wandering set of nerves, so it's not one nerve. It's not like one fiber, one axon. As we say in the nervous system, we have these wires, we call axons that let neurons communicate. It's a bunch of neurons and a bunch of wires that go everywhere, so where do they go? Well they leave the brain, and the brain stem, the brain stem is kind of the back of your brain. If you touch the back of your neck, it's about three inches deep to where you're touching. The neurons that are there send information into the body to control your bodily organs, how fast your heart is, beating how fast you're breathing, how fast your digestion is occurring. Even things like whether or not you are going to secrete so-called killer cells, your immune cells from your spleen to go ward off bacteria. Now the neurons there don't know what to do unless they receive information about what's going on within the body and within the body, your heart, your lungs, your diaphragm, your gut, so everything from your intestines to your stomach, et cetera, and your spleen or sending information also up to the brain. So as I mentioned before, it's a two-way street. So the vagus nerve is a very important nerve, but just by saying vagus nerve, it sounds like a singular. It sounds like one thing, but actually what we're talking about is a series of super highways, it's like Google maps, it's got stuff going everywhere with alternate routes, communicating back and forth. There are two fundamental features of what's going on in your body that need to be communicated to your brain, these neurons in your brain stem in order for your brain and your body to work together correctly. And the two types of information are mechanical information. So things like pressure, things like lack of pressure and chemical information, whether or not your gut is acidic or whether or not it's not acidic, whether or not you have some sort of pathogen, you know, something that you ate or that got into your body somehow and is making you sick or whether or not you don't have a pathogen in your body. So you've got mechanical sensing and chemical sensing. So when you think about your sense of self and your ability to understand what's going on in your body, if you feel good, or if you feel bad, your sense of self is dependent on these mechanical phenomenon and these chemical phenomenon. And for every organ in your body, whether or not that's your heart or your lungs or your spleen, both the mechanical information about that organ for instance, is if your gut is full or empty, whether or not your heart is beating fast or beating slowly, that's mechanical, and chemical information, whether or not your gut feels nice, and whether, you know, when I say nice, I mean, whether or not it has a balance of acidity and alkalinity, that feels right to you or whether or not your gut feels off, it doesn't feel quite right. That's chemical information. If you are not getting enough oxygen and levels of carbon dioxide and other gas go up too high. So your lungs can register that and that chemical information is sent to your brain. And then your brain does certain things actually really encourages you to do certain things in order to adjust that chemistry. So the first principle that everyone should understand about their sense of self is that they are sensing mechanical and chemical information about every organ in their body, except for one, and that's the brain. Your brain actually doesn't have pain receptors. It doesn't even have touch receptors. The brain is a command center. It helps drive and govern changes in the organs of the body. But your brain doesn't move, at least not much. It can move a little bit fluid moves within it. But as long as you're healthy, it's not moving that much. Your brain has no sensation of its own, in fact, when they do brain surgery on people, they will the size or put some anesthesia on the scalp. They'll cut away the skin there so that people don't feel anything. They'll use some anesthesia they'll peel back the skin and then they'll use a, let's call it what it is, it's a bone saw. And they basically saw open a little window in the skull. I've actually done this before and seen this before. I've done this many times before, and once you're inside the brain, you can put electrodes in there and you can put various things in there, of course, all for therapeutic purposes. And you do that without any anesthesia to the actual brain tissue, because it has no receptors to sense anything. It doesn't have pain receptors. It doesn't have pressure receptors. None of that, when you have a headache in your head, feels like it's too much pressure, well that's because of here's that lie outside the brain. So your organs are different. They need to tell your brain what's going on. And there are ways that you can control the mechanical and the chemical state of your organs in ways that are very powerful, and this is crucial to do, because if you can properly regulate the mechanical and chemical environment of your body, your brain functions better. This is absolutely clear from data that if your gut is healthy, if you get the alkalinity right, the acidity, right, and if your spleen is healthy and happy, and if your lungs are working properly, not just breathing and pumping in and out air, but you're breathing at the right cadence for a particular activity, then your brain will function better. So let's talk about how you can adjust the mechanical and chemical environment of your organs in order to make your brain better and how your brain can make the mechanical and chemical environment within your organs function better. For instance we're going to talk about how you can change the chemistry of your gut in order for your brain to be able to focus better, think better, remember better and sleep better. And we're going to talk about how you can change the chemistry of other organs in your body, such that your immune system will function better than it would otherwise. And you can actually heal faster from small cuts and bruises, but also injuries of any kind, even major injuries. So as I mentioned before, we've got these organs, the heart, the lungs, the diaphragm, and I'll explain what that is, the gut and the spleen. And the spleen is this immune organ. Let's take one example of these and explain how mechanical and chemical information from this particular set of organs communicates to the brain and how that changes how our brain works. And the organ I'd like to focus on first are the lungs and the diaphragm. So we're all familiar with our lungs, these two big bags of air, but they're actually not two big bags of air. They actually have little tiny sacs within them, actually millions of little sacs called the alveoli of the lungs. The alveoli of the lungs are like little tiny balloons throughout our lungs, and the more of those balloons, we have, the more air that we can actually contain. So we are not too big bags of air in there, our lungs, we actually have millions and millions of little tiny bags of air within those lungs. Those little bags of air can fill up or they can deflate, right, just like your lungs overall can fill up or they can deflate. The diaphragm is a muscle, it's kind of shaped like a dome. So it's kind of a, you know, think about a basketball or a soccer ball that has most of the air pushed out of it. And so it's kind of crescent shape or dome shaped, and it sits below our lungs and the way the diaphragm and the lungs work together is very interesting. The diaphragm is actually skeletal muscles. So it's just like a bicep or a quadricep. And the fact that it is skeletal muscle is important because it has a unique property, which is that you can control it voluntarily. You can decide to take control of your diaphragm by just consciously deciding you want to breathe in a particular way, just like you can take conscious control over your legs. They will work just fine, if you're not thinking about them, as you walk as provide, you already know how to walk, but at any moment, you can decide to change the rate of your walking, your so-called cadence of walking. So the diaphragm as a skeletal muscle also has that property, the diaphragm moves up and down, depending on how you breathe, or rather, I should say how the diaphragm moves up and down determines how you breathe. How you breathe is also dependent on little muscles that are between your ribs, the intercostals and other muscles, if you're a martial arts fan that Bruce Lee was famous for having these very pronounced intercostals from doing all sorts of, you know, bridging exercise, et cetera. But those are the muscles. And we all have them, even if some of us, most of us don't have, intercostals like Bruce Lee. So when you breathe a couple things happen, but let's talk about the mechanical things first. And then let's talk about how those mechanical steps relate back to the brain and what that does for the brain. And I can promise you that if you develop an awareness of these mechanical changes, you do not have to go through extensive breathwork practice or do extensive breathwork. You will immediately believe it or not develop a sense of your breathing self of your lungs and diaphragm. It takes no practice, but once you do it, you will forever be changed in terms of your awareness of your breathing and your ability to leverage your breathing. Kind of like the steering wheel on a car in order to shift your brain in the direction that you want to go. So it's a very powerful system. And the way it works is the following. And this will also incorporate the heart, so, and by the heart, I don't mean it in the emotional sense. Although we don't rule out emotions here at the Huberman Lab podcast, we like emotions, but I'm talking about the heart as an organ, as a beating organ, that circulates blood. So when we inhale, these little sacs in our lungs fill up and our lungs expand. And when we do that, we take up space in our thoracic cavity and our diaphragm moves down, okay. When we exhale, the diaphragm moves up, the lungs get smaller, okay? So inhales, diaphragm moves down. Exhales, diaphragm moves up. This actually controls our heart rate, but it does it by changing the way that our brain works. And it works in the following way. So when we inhale, our lungs fill our diaphragm moves down. Our heart actually has a little more space because the diaphragm's moved down. So the heart gets a little bit bigger, physically bigger, not in the emotional sense, but physically bigger. And as a consequence, whatever blood is in the heart flows at a slower rate because it's a larger volume, so bigger volume heart, same amount of blood inside the heart means slower flow. Okay, sort of like expanding a pipe. The brain registers that because there are a set of neurons in the heart called the sinoatrial node. It sends that information to the brain. That information is registered by the brain and the brain sends a message back to the heart to speed the heart up. So every time you inhale because of these mechanical changes in the diaphragm and lungs, and because of the mechanical changes in the heart, your brain sends a signal to the heart to speed the heart up, so if you do long inhales or you inhale more vigorously, you actually are speeding your heart up. Now, of course you have to exhale as well. But for instance, if I were to inhale very long like [inhales heavily] the entire time my heart rate is increasing. And then if I did a quick exhale, [exhales quickly] something else will happen, but if I kept doing that, [inhales heavily, exhales quickly] my heart rate would increase. It's not going to increase linearly and forever, but it will increase with each inhale. Or I can simply make my inhales more vigorous. [inhales quickly] And my heart rate will speed up. This is an autonomic and automatic relationship between the diaphragm, the lungs, the brain, and the heart. Now, if inhale speed the heart up, what happens on exhales? When we exhale, the diaphragm moves up. It's a little counterintuitive, but you can kind of think about it as like pushing the plunge on a syringe, right? When you exhale, this thing moves up and as the diaphragm moves up, the heart has less space. Meaning it gets a little bit smaller, which means that whatever volume of blood is inside the heart moves faster, through that smaller volume, that information is sent to the brain via these collection of neurons called the sinoatrial node for you aficionados. The brain then sends information via the vagus nerve back to the heart, to slow the heart down. So while inhales speed up the heart, that's the net effect exhales, slow the heart down. And the reason they slow the heart down is because of a register in the change in mechanical pressure between the diaphragm, the lungs and the heart. So this is to me, the simplest and most straightforward example of how the brain is changing the way our organs work, our heart in this case, according to changes in mechanical interoception. Now, we're not always aware of this, some of us are aware of it, some of us aren't. If you do it right now, you will be aware of it, so you can try this. You can basically, this is an experiment or an example in interoception, in sensing one's self. So if you inhale, doesn't matter how long you inhale. I'll do it for a couple seconds [inhales quickly] and then exhale twice as long. [exhales slowly] Nose or mouth, doesn't matter, the entire time that you're exhaling, you're slowing your heart down. So just as a car has an accelerator and a brake, or you can slow a car by coming off the accelerator. When you exhale, you're effectively coming off the accelerator, or if you want to think about it differently, you're hitting the brake, you're slowing down your heart rate. Now, normally your heart rate stays in more or less the same range for a given activity because you're inhaling and exhaling. But this is just a simple way of showing that mechanical changes in your viscera can change the way that your brain works and then your brain changes the way that those viscera work. And it's a very concrete agreement, it's like a contract between the organs of your body and the brain. In fact, you can think about this contract in more detail, and you can leverage this in a very powerful way to set the conditions of your mind. If you want to be more calm, emphasize exhales, and the simplest way to do this. I've talked about this many times before, but if you haven't heard me say it, this will become immediately clear is to emphasize exhales through what's called a physiological sigh. Two inhales, could be through the nose of the mouth, but ideally through the nose, so [inhales quickly twice] so followed by a long exhale. [exhales slowly] Those double inhales are kind of important because what they do is they maximally fill all those little sacs in your lungs, and then when you breathe out, you're exhaling as much of the so-called carbon dioxide in your system as possible. We'll talk about carbon oxide in a second. So the fastest way to calm down is to emphasize exhales. When you make exhales longer, you're slowing your heart rate, you're calming down. You don't need any sophisticated training. You don't have to do this for minutes on end. You don't have to do anything. You don't even have to call it breathwork. It's just respiration, and in fact, you do this every night. When you go to sleep and carbon dioxide builds up too much in your bloodstream, or if you hold your breath or something, or you watch an animal or a small child that sleeping, they will occasionally do these double inhale long exhales it's way of slowing the heart down and eliminating carbon oxide. The opposite is also true. If you inhale deeply or vigorously and then exhale less long or less vigorously, you will increase your level of alertness through these purely mechanical aspects of your interoception. So for instance, if I were to take a big deep inhale [inhales deeply] and then a short exhale, [exhales quickly] and then another one, a big inhale, [inhales deeply] short exhale, [exhales quickly] It only takes two or three of those before you start to feel more alert. And that's because your heart rate is increasing. And actually if you keep doing that for 25 or 30 breaths of inhale deep short exhale, you will start to secrete a lot of adrenaline. This hormone that comes from your kidneys and from your brainstem make you feel really alert. You will actually feel as if you've had a cup of espresso. So you will immediately wake up. And there's an intermediate form of breathing, which is sometimes called box breathing, but it's really equal inhale and exhale duration. And these, it basically goes like this. You're you're going to inhale, so do this for maybe two, three seconds inhale, [inhales] then hold, okay, two, three seconds. Then exhale, two, three seconds. Then hold two, three seconds. Most often people forget to hold. So it's inhale, hold, exhale, hold for equal or more or less equal durations, could be one second, could be two seconds, could be three seconds. Most people find that when you get out past five seconds, they start to struggle to maintain the so-called box breathing. And most people can't consciously box breathe for too terribly long without having to think about it. But the point here is that through purely mechanical means changing the way that you breathe, emphasizing inhales or exhales, or keeping them the same will change the way that your brain works, how alert you are and how well you function in anything. And again, this doesn't mean that breathwork has no value. It's just simply to say that long extended protocols of breathwork are simply, they are truly simply just an exploration of this fundamental relationship between the mechanics of your internal organs and your brain and how your brain controls those internal organs. Now you might ask, well, how is this pressure known? How does the body actually know how full the lungs are, now? This is an answer that's more for the aficionados out there, but I've had a few requests, or I should say thousands of requests for more in-depth science, so if you're not interested more in depth science, just this will allow you to tune out now for maybe just 10 seconds, and if you are interested, pay careful attention, there is a set of receptors which are called piezo receptors, P-I-E-Z-O piezo receptors, piezo means pressure. And these were discovered a few years ago by a couple of different laboratories, but one of the main ones, one of the main laboratories that discovered these piezo receptors is the laboratory of Ardem Patapoutian. I love saying his name, even though I'm probably pronouncing it, he's a friend and a former colleague when my lab was down in San Diego, he's at the Scripps Institute, he's a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, which basically means that he's a total stud of science and has made many important discoveries. The piezo receptors line many tissues, and inform the brain about pressure in those tissues. But the lungs have a particular category of piezo receptors called piezo two receptors. And as you fill your lungs and these little sacs of air, the alveoli fill, the piezo two receptors because of the way they react to that filling send information by way of a bunch of neurons, a bunch of wires up to the brain and tell you how full your lungs are, so that's the kind of mechanistic detail. If you want to learn more about that, you can look up our Ardem's lab at the Scripps and the beautiful work that they and other laboratories are doing on piezos, piezos are pretty cool. I think I also just like saying piezo, so that's why I brought that up as well. So mechanical sensing of the lungs, heart and diaphragm. And now let's talk about chemical sensing because there's carbon dioxide and there's oxygen. And this is really simple. You have oxygen and carbon dioxide and you need them both. I sometimes hear people talk about carbon dioxide is this bad thing and oxygen, it has a good thing. You need them both, and you need them in the appropriate balance. You have a collection of neurons in your brain that register when carbon dioxide levels get to a certain point in your bloodstream. When that point, that threshold is reached, these neurons fire, and they cause you to breathe sometimes called the gasp reflex, it just makes you want to inhale. And as a consequence, you bring in more oxygen. Okay, so we don't really breathe to get oxygen. That's a by-product of inhaling to eliminate carbon dioxide. You don't want carbon dioxide levels to go too high. In fact, if you want to freak somebody out and we do these in experiments, and I don't recommend you do this, you just increase the levels of carbon dioxide that they inhale, and the brain will go into an almost immediate panic response because the health of all our tissues depends on keeping a nice balance between carbon dioxide and oxygen. You don't want carbon dioxide levels to go too high. So the impulse to breathe, if you're under water, or if you hold your breath is triggered by these neurons and the triggering of those neurons comes from elevated carbon dioxide in the bloodstream. And for those of you that don't quite know how to conceptualize the relationship between bloodstream and breath, I do think it's important. And maybe you remember this from high school biology, but if you don't, I'll make it clear for you now, it's very easy. You inhale air and that air and the oxygen molecules in that air actually move from your lungs into the bloodstream because these little alveoli of the lungs, those little sacs of air are in there, they basically have a lot of little micro vessels and capillaries, little tiny, basically blood vessels, essentially, although they're mostly capillaries, micro capillaries are the little tiny ones, that line them, so there's actually an interface and opportunity for air and molecules within the air to pass into the blood and then they move in your bloodstream, and when you exhale, the opposite is true. So you can move things from the air, into your bloodstream or from your bloodstream into the air by way of the lungs, and there's a lot more detail to it. And I'm sure those of you that are experts out there. If you want to put some stuff in the comments, maybe a little bit of a kind of intermediate tutorial, you might even entitle it, intermediate tutorial. If you know a lot about this, just I'll check it, but make sure you get the details, right. Make sure you know the process. And I find that for people that are interested in understanding how breathing really works, it's really nice to think about the relationship between the heart and the vascular system, the blood and the air system, the respiration system, and breathing, because those two things are very, we say, they're interdigitated, they're interwoven with one another. So how does this work, well, carbon dioxide is too high, you breathe in, you inspire, you, inhale you off as a consequence, when you exhale, you offload carbon dioxide. There's a really cool way that you can explore this chemistry of your breathing and your bloodstream and the way that your brain works in ways that can really benefit your health. And it works the following way. You want to essentially sit or lie down. It doesn't really matter. You definitely don't want to be anywhere near water, not a bathtub, not a hot tub, not a, you know, not a cold dunk or something. In fact, don't even be in a puddle. And what you want to do in this case is you're going to breathe in deep. So that's going to increase your heart rate and then exhale passively by just letting air fall out of your mouth. So it will look something like this. [inhales vigorously, exhales passively] So it's you breathe in vigorously and then you let the air just fall out of your mouth. When you do that, what you're essentially doing is you're bringing in a lot of oxygen through that deep breath. And you're exhaling a little bit of that carbon dioxide. But if you were to repeat it 25 times, maybe 30 times, it doesn't matter if it's 25 or 30, somewhere in there, you would essentially start bringing in a lot of oxygen and blowing off or exhaling a lot of carbon dioxide. So you're actually going to change the chemistry of your internal landscape, and you can then sense it. You can interocept what that is like. And there are some really interesting reasons for wanting to do that, so I'm not going to do all 25 or 30 now, maybe do five or 10, so you can get a sense of what it looks like, so that it's clear. I'm going to essentially demonstrate now, so it's inhale, [inhales vigorously] exhale through the mouth,[exhales] I am inhaling the nose, [inhales vigorously, exhales passively multiple times] So it's essentially, excuse me, a two second or so inhale and then a one second or so exhale, and as I was doing that, I can kind of feel my face get flush and my body is heating up and my brain is heating up, what's happening there? Well that pattern of breathing is increasing levels of adrenaline in my brain and body, and I'm getting more alert. Then after 25 or 30 of those, you exhale all your air. [exhales deeply] You dump all your air. You can do that, your nose or your mouth. And then you hold your breath with your lungs empty for about 15 to 30 seconds. Now, for those of you that want to explore this, and please be careful as you explore this, don't do anything stupid, like do this while you're driving or something like that. You can exhale all your air and what you'll find then is you can hold your breath for a very long time. And the reason you can do that is because you've blown off all the carbon dioxide or most of the carbon dioxide in your bloodstream. So you shifted the chemistry of your blood by breathing in a particular way. And by doing that, you are no longer triggering these neurons that cause the gasp reflex or the reflex to breathe. Now, of course you have to breathe sooner or later but what you'll find is if normally your ability to hold your breath is a minute or so before you really feel that gasp reflex kick in, you might find that you can go 90 seconds or two minutes. And with some practice, people find that they can start holding their breath for three or four minutes or longer. This is actually how free divers do what they do. I do not want anyone free diving. If you're going to learn free diving, please learn it from an expert. Many people die trying to teach themselves out of free dive or trying to teach their friends at a free dive when they don't know what they're doing. This is not what this is about, don't again, don't do this anywhere near water, but it is a very interesting exploration of how you can shift the chemistry of your bloodstream by modulating your air by modulating the mechanics of your diaphragm and lungs and thereby shift the way your mind works, your brain. And in fact, what you'll notice is that even though during that 25 or 30 breaths, [inhales and exhales quickly] you'll feel very alert, when you exhale all your air and you're in the breath hold, you will feel very alert, but very calm. Now this is interesting because it's a state that we all sort of want to achieve alert, but calm, but have a hard time achieving. And so for those of you that have a hard time obtaining focus for sake of work or focus for sake of anything I should say, and when you are able to achieve focus, it's through the use of things like stimulants, or you feel like you have to have a cold shower or ice bath, or you have to have four espresso in order to be alert, but then you're too alert, you're jittery. You can't focus. This pattern of breathing can lend itself very well to entering states of alert, but calm for the fall, the 10 or even 20 minutes that follow that breathing. And then you could repeat it if you want. So it's a very useful practice to explore. Some of you may be familiar with this practice and so-called Wim Hof breathing. Wim Hof is a practitioner of what's called Tumo breathing. Tumo breathing has been around for centuries. And for those of you that are familiar with breathwork and yoga practices, I acknowledged that nothing I just described is new based on science, however, the science informs why those practices work. And just as a little mini editorial, I just want to emphasize as well. That one thing that this podcast is really about is trying to remove fancy nomenclature, whether or not it's yogic nomenclature or scientific nomenclature so that people can access protocols. Because the moment we start naming things after people or calling them Tumo et cetera, I have no problem with that, but it doesn't inform how the practices are done, nor does it inform the underlying mechanisms. So here I'm trying to teach you the mechanisms. And as a final point to that, the most powerful form of breathing is the one that takes into account the fundamental mechanisms that in increase heart rate, that exhales decrease heart rate, and that carbon dioxide and oxygen relate to the bloodstream and the brain in particular ways, once you understand those components, then you can create your own so-called breathwork practices. You can breathe in the ways that best serve you, as opposed to thinking that one protocol is the best or holy protocol for everything, because it's simply not. As a final final point, I want to say that as you shift the way that you breathe, whether or not you're showing off more carbon dioxide or bringing in more oxygen, you are fundamentally changing the chemistry of your internal milieu have your body, and that has been shown to have important effects on the way that your immune system functions and the way that you deal with inflammation and all sorts of different sort of things that can enter your body and cause problems or conditions of stress, et cetera. So I will explore that further as the episode goes on, but I want to move on to just touch on one other aspect of reading, that's purely mechanical, which I think is very interesting and important, which relates to a particular reflex that you're going to be very familiar with in a second. And that can serve you very well in times of extreme stress. The reflex I'm referring to is something called the Hering Breuer Reflex. I'm not going to go into details about how the Hering Breuer reflex works, but it has to do with particular classes of neurons and cells that are called a Baroreceptors. Those are basically pressure receptors, they sense pressure. And basically what the Hering Breuer reflex is about is that when your lung is inflated, your desire to breathe is reduced. So you can try that right now, you can inhale [inhales] huge big thing of air. And hold, okay? Your desire to breathe will kick in later than were are you to exhale all your air and hold your breath. When you exhale all your air and your breath, unless you've done the sort of protocol I described a few minutes ago of doing a bunch of inhales and exhales first in a very deliberate way, you will feel empty. Those Baroreceptors are going to be firing like crazy saying, there's no pressure in here, there's no pressure here, I got nothing in here. You need to breathe, you need to breathe in, the gasp reflex will kick in sooner. You can apply that in all sorts of situations related to exercise, related to modulating stress, et cetera. So the Hering Breuer reflex is a very powerful one. This is why you take a big deep breath before you go under water. [inhales heavily] All right, you're not going to exhale all your air and go under water. If you were to exhale all your air and go under water, you would absolutely feel the need to come up sooner for a breath of air than had you a full tank, so to speak a full of lungs full of air. And this is also the way that people teach themselves to feel comfortable under water. So when you learn how to swim, you learn how to swim both by having air in your lungs while you're underwater and no air in your lungs while you're underwater. In any event the Hering Breuer reflex is yet another dimension to the way that mechanical pressure influences your brain's decision-making, about what to do with your body, in this case, whether or not to breathe. So now I want to shift away from breathing and diaphragm and lungs and move toward another organ within our viscera, which is our gut. So this includes our stomach and our intestines, our esophagus and so forth. It's been said before, both by me and by others that we are, but a series of tubes, and indeed that's true. Believe it or not, every system in your body is a tube. Your brain is actually a tube that connects your spinal cord, which has also a tube. You started off as a tube, you were like a churro. You know, those churros I don't know if you're not familiar with churros, they're like donuts that are shaped like a tube. That's essentially what you look like early in development, not long after conception and the front end of that churro grew and grew and grew, but you always maintained a hollow through that tube. That's why you have what are called ventricles, gaps or a space in your brain and spinal cord that run the length of your brain and spinal cord and fluid, cerebral spinal fluid, and other things move through that space. We're going to return to the ventricles later, they are very important. They're just space filled with fluid, but they do a lot. Similarly your digestive system starts with the tube at your mouth and of course goes down through your throat. And then you've got all the elements of the stomach and the intestines, and then it comes out the other end. So you are, but a series of different tubes, your vascular system, a series of other tubes. So you're tubes. The way your digestive system works is to communicate to your brain about the status of the mechanical pressures along this tube, so within your stomach and your intestines, et cetera, and the chemical status of that tube at various portions within that tube to inform your brain about how your brain should control that tube. So let's start with the mechanical sensing of your gut. If you drink a lot of fluid, or if you eat a lot of food, your gut will fill up, your stomach will fill up with food. Now it gets digested there. It gets digested elsewhere along your digestive track too, of course but it starts getting digested there because along this tube, you have a series of what are called sphincters, which basically are like little draw pulls. Have you ever had a laundry bag, which has a drawstring on it? You pull it and then it cinches shut, and then you can open it again, that's what those are. Those are sphincter openings and you have them in your throat, you have them along your digestive tract, all the way to the end. Food will enter your gut. And if there's a lot of that food, pressure receptors, some of which are these piezo receptors will communicate to the areas of your brain that are involved in feeding, and we'll say, don't eat anymore. You don't need to consume anymore, now, some people bypass that these, I guess they have these like hotdog eating competitions. I'm always struck by how some of those people are like, seem to be rail thin, but they actually train for those competitions by ingesting large volumes of water, actually a very dangerous practice. You can actually kill yourself by drinking too much water, and you can kill yourself by ingesting too much of anything, really to expand your gut, not a good practice, not a big fan of those competitions. But even if you're one of those people or you're the world heavyweight champion of them, they are informative toward what I'm talking about now, which is that as you expand the gut, a signal is sent by neurons, literally nerve cells that are in the gut to the brain, stem up to the areas of the brain that are involved in feeding, I did a whole episode on feeding. You can find on \\\"Feeding, Metabolism And Hunger.\\\" You're welcome to listen to that episode, if you like, and we'll shut down the neurons that drive the desire to put more stuff in your mouth. That thing that people say sometimes on well in this country frequently after Thanksgiving meal, I can't put another bite in my mouth. Literally they shut down some of the basic movements of the musculature to take another fork bite. I know it sounds crazy, but they can actually control your brain. So your gut is so full that it's controlling your brains, such that this action of spooning food towards your mouth is actually inhibited. It's made more difficult or less likely to occur. It's incredible. The converse is also true, when these piezo receptors signal to the brain, that the gut is empty independent of your need, your actual need for food. There's a signal that sent to your brain that says gut is empty and neurons get stimulated in areas like the arcuate nucleus and these areas of the hypothalamus and et cetera, that drive the desire to make this action, to open the mouth and to put stuff in it in particular food. So when you find yourself at the refrigerator or you find yourself almost, you know, manically trying to get food of different cons, you're not even thinking about what you're eating, because you're so hungry, in part that's because the lack of food in your gut has sent that information to your brain and is driving particular fixed action patterns that are associated with eating, in fact, one of the first things children learn how to do is open their mouth when something is presented to it. And then they learn how to move a spoon or a fork. They're not very good at it, at first, they get all over the place, but eventually they get good at, or at least most people get good at if you watch how people eat, you know, it's kind of very variable out there. In any event, this is a purely mechanical phenomenon. And this purely mechanical phenomenon is driving our brain to drive certain behavior. You can get better at registering sense of fullness or lack of fullness in a very particular way. Some people have a very keen sense of how full or empty their stomach is, so if you've eaten anything, even if it's a small volume of food in the last hour to three hours, it's actually a worthwhile practice to take a few moments, maybe 10, 20 seconds, and actually just try and concentrate on sensing the neurons in your gut and how full you are, like for instance, I ate a few hours ago and then I had a little snack about 30 minutes ago or so. And my gut feels neither terribly full nor terribly empty. It's kind of, I would put it kind of like 30, 40% okay. So by just taking conscious awareness of how full or empty our gut is at various times between meals, after a meal, before a meal, you can very quickly develop a sense of how full or empty you are. Now, what's the consequence of that? The consequence of that is actually rather interesting. It's been shown that the consequence of that is actually that you can better override the signals of these piezo receptors and gut fullness or emptiness. So for those of you that find that you eat kind of compulsively or non-consciously, or subconsciously, I should say, probably have to be conscious enough to be awake to eat, but subconsciously you just find yourself eating and here I'm describing myself, I'm like, I'm a drive by blueberry eater. If there's a bowl of blueberries, every time I walk past it, I sort of have to grab a handful of them and pop them in my mouth, but if you develop this sense of how much mecho-pressure, it's not really word, but how much mechano-sensation is in your gut, very quickly, you can learn to override that. You might ask, why would I want to be able to override whether or not my stomach is empty or my stomach is full? Well, there are many reasons to want to do that. Many people right now are interested in so-called intermittent fasting. They're doing fast of anywhere from 12 to 16 hours, every 24 hour cycle, that's actually what my practice is. I do that on a regular basis, sometimes the, I eat breakfast, but normally I pushed breakfast out to about 11 or noon, or sometimes a little later, some people are doing longer fast, and there are really wonderful data publishing excellent journals from my colleagues Satchin Panda at the Salk Institute Of Biological Studies. And of course from other laboratories showing that intermittent fasting can and will have some positive health effects on things like liver health and brain health and other aspects of health. Whether or not it's the best form of dieting for the sake of losing weight, that's very controversial, but it's clear that having a period of fasting every 24 hours or perhaps even longer from time to time can be beneficial because it stimulates what's called autophagy, the clearing away, or the body's ability to eat certain dead cells, so called senescent cells, and for many people, they struggle with fasting because they feel they have a very keen sense of their stomach being empty. And they feel as if they have to eat. And in a kind of counter-intuitive way, there's some data that indicate that being able to sense whether or not your gut is full or empty, and just the knowledge that that's communicating information to your brain about whether to not to eat or not just that awareness, that understanding allows them to override the signal. They think, oh, you know, I'm not actually in need of nutrients right now. It's just that my stomach is empty. And these piezo receptors, and some other ones that I'll tell you about in a moment are signaling to my brain that it's empty. I don't actually need food, it's just, it's just that my brain is reacting to the fact that my gut is deflated, so to speak or a smaller, doesn't have food in it. So there are other ways that our guts communicate with our brain, it's not just our stomach talking to our brain. It's also our intestines talk to our brain. The Liberles Lab the guy's name is Steven Liberles, he runs a lab at Harvard Medical School, it's a terrific lab, does excellent work on gut, brain communication and other aspects of viscera brain communication. They discovered a category of neurons called the GLP1R neurons, these are neurons that are basically in your neck, I mean, they're part of the nervous system, but they're, you can, they can be found near your neck. And those neurons send little wires down into the intestines and deep into the stomach, but mostly into the intestines and they sense stretch of your intestines. So this is pretty wild. These neurons sense how stretched out your intestines are and how fast things are moving through your intestines, slow or fast, or if there's nothing there. And then those neurons send another branch, they have a branch in one direction, senses what's going on in your intestines. And they have another branch that goes up from your neck in your brain to either trigger the desire to eat more or just stop eating. So these are really cool neurons and they're basically stretch receptors. They look a lot like the piezo receptors that we talked about before, so these GLP1R neurons are sensing stretch, so purely mechanical sensing. And in addition to that, the Liberles Lab discovered neurons that detect nutrients themselves. Now, the main reason why we need to eat is to bring nutrients into our body. And there is another set of neurons, those are called GPR65 neurons, if you want to know, but you don't have to remember that, do the same thing in terms of their connections. They send connections down into the intestines and into the gut, into the stomach, but mostly into the intestines. And then send that information back up to the brain as to whether or not there are certain kinds of nutrients in our digestive track. Now, these neurons are the ones to pay attention to if we're talking about chemical signaling and then in the next couple of minutes, I'm going to tell you about how you can understand hunger and had a modulate your hunger for the right foods, in fact, for healthy foods. The way this is done is by leveraging the activity of these GPR65 neurons, these neurons that sense nutrients, okay. They're telling your brain what's in your gut and intestines, and you have another set of neurons that were discovered by another guy he's out at Duke University, his name is Diego, excuse me, Diego Borges he's a wonderful scientist. He has a degree in nutrition, but also in neuroscience. And he found that there are neurons that line the gut, and those neurons in collaboration with these GPR65 neurons are sensing for three things, okay? So we say nutrients, which nutrients are they looking for? What are these neurons paying attention to? While these neurons are activated by the presence of fatty acids in particular, omega-3 fatty acids, sorts of things that come from fatty fish, oil, krill, certain kinds of animal protein, animal, and plant substances. You can look up what has a lot of omega-3s and those omega-3s make these neurons fire electrically like crazy up to the brain and make you want to eat more of those things, but it turns out in pretty appropriate levels. These neurons also respond to amino acids. So when you eat a food, it's broken down in the gut, actually the way it's broken down in the gut is kind of interesting. Your gut basically cinches off a sphincter up top, cinches off a sphincter below it when there's food there. And then you have a series of smooth muscles that tumble the food and literally physically break it down. And then of course, enzymes come in and start digesting the food. And we're going to talk about digestion and how that's communicated to the brain in a moment. And for those of you with any autoimmune issues or digestive issues, this is going to be very important conversation. But meanwhile there are these neurons in the gut and as these fatty acids float out of the digested food, so literally fat molecules, and as amino acids are coming from the proteins as they're digested in the gut. And as a third food item, sugars are coming from the foods that we eat. These neurons will fire a lot to the brain that says, Hey, whatever you're doing up there, do more of it, okay? Now the sugars are a little bit cryptic because when I say sugars or I say amino acids, or I say fatty acids, this has nothing to do with taste. In fact, beautiful experiments have been done by the Borges Lab and by other labs showing that even if you numb the mouth, even if you gavavge, which is a really, just a, it's a fancy word for basically tube feeding, you put a tube down into the gut, you just deliver the food to the gut. So you get no opportunity to taste, it sounds pretty awful. If you force feed by gavage, or you numb the mouth, these neurons don't care about the mouth. They only care about the nutrients coming from these foods. And then they signal to the brain, hey, do that thing, do that thing where you lift that object, we call a fork or a spoon, do that thing where you drink the milkshake, do that thing where you move your mouth like this, not talking, but do that thing where you swallow. So that's how the nutrients in our gut control us. And this is why for people that experience extreme sugar cravings, or even mild sugar cravings, replacing those foods with foods that have high levels of omega-3 or amino acids can produce sugar cravings. And I've talked about this on a previous episode, but if you didn't catch it, no big deal. I'll tell you right now that for many people, the solution to sugar cravings is to ingest a small amount, maybe a teaspoon or so of an amino acid called glutamine. And if you have really extreme sugar cravings, you can even mix that glutamine with a full-fat cream, which actually makes it taste pretty darn good. And you drink that anytime you have a sugar craving or just a sip or two of that. And we find is that the sugar cravings disappear, because you're basically giving fat and amino acids to those neurons in the gut and in the intestine, that signal to the brain that you want more. Now, this doesn't give you a kind of runaway hunger for full fat cream. Although it will say when I was in high school for various reasons, but mostly because I liked the way it tastes. I was using half and half in my cereal. And I was waking up in the middle of night and drinking half and half, and that stuff tastes pretty darn good once you get used to the high fat content. Not something I do now. But the point is these neurons don't really know taste, they only know nutrients. And so you can work with that system if you crave sugar, and I do believe that most if not all of us should be trying to limit, if not eliminate simple sugars, as much as possible most of the time, then things like glutamine, things like high omega-3 foods, et cetera, maybe even want to supplement with fish oil or something similar to get omega-3s, there are other reasons for wanting to do that too, can be very beneficial. And here's what we're talking about is interoception, it's your ability to sense your inner real estate, but in this case, by way of chemical signaling, not by way of mechanical signaling. So now I'd like to talk about another aspect of gut chemistry that has profound effects on the brain, as well as on the immune system. And for those of you with auto-immune conditions, or for those of you that know people with auto-immune conditions, this is going to be a very important discussion. Your gut needs to maintain a certain level of acidity or alkalinity, for those of you without any chemistry background, basically the low numbers on the pH scale, that means more acidic, the higher, the numbers, more alkaline, so more alkaline means more basic and acidic means acidic. And it has to do with whom hydrogen atoms and all this other stuff, but you don't need to worry about that right now. We're not going to pH your gut right now, but we are going to talk about the pH of your gut. Your gut needs to be more acidic than essentially all other tissues of your body in order to function properly, bacteria thrive in alkaline conditions. I think this is important for people to understand. People are always thinking, oh, you should be more alkaline being acidic, that almost sounds like being inflamed at well, you know, it's a complicated discussion, but I think the semantics can be confusing, sometimes you want your gut to be acidic. You may ask, well, why are people taking antacids? Well, those antacids are there for a particular purpose to essentially combat acid reflux, which is the sending up of stuff in the gut towards the esophagus. And it can cause heartburn and things of that sort. And the way the antacids work is they essentially cause the sphincters above the gut to sinch shut, but they really are only dealing with a symptom, not the cause. So rewind, and about 10, 20 years ago, the discussion about gut acidity was quite a bit different than it is now in the scientific and medical literature. In fact, for many years long before, I'm going to say it here, people have been saying that it's important to maintain proper acidity of the gut, but the science and medical professions sort of looked at that as kind of a scance like, you know, what's going on there, I don't, I don't know that there's any evidence that that's actually true, there are communities of people that were prescribing, or I should say recommending that people take hydrochloric acid HCL and adjusting gut acidity that way. And it was kind of frowned upon, now in looking over the peer reviewed literature, it's clear that this business of trying to make the gut a little more acidic is actually one way in which people treat or try and ameliorate acid reflux. So it's kind of counterintuitive increasing acidity in the gut to try and reduce acid reflux, thought you're supposed to take antacids, well, the field has shifted quite a bit. And so we're going to review what it is to maintain the chemistry of the gut at a slightly more acidic level or a more aesthetic level, I should say, because it turns out that there are a number of things that are in gut are just call it what it is, it's gastric juice, sounds kind of gross. But gastric juices are actually powerful modulators of brain state. Put differently, one of the best things that you can do to have a healthy brain, a well-functioning brain and a healthy and well-functioning body is to maintain proper gut chemistry. And that's basically accomplished by getting the right level of acidity and alkalinity in your gut. Now this is not quack pseudoscience. This is not based on cleanses or anything of that sort. Well, we're going to talk about now are peer reviewed data in very high quality journals, like the Journal Cell, which is one of the three apex science nature, so, and journals of that sort, that point to the gut microbiome and its relationship to acidity of the gut and how the gut microbiome can help enhance auto-immune function and various other aspects of brain and body health. So within all the mucosal lining tissues of our body, we have what are called microbiota, little micro organisms that we didn't make that actually come from our environment or our food and live inside us. And there are good microbiota and there are bad microbiota whether or not we have good microbiota or bad microbiota depends on one thing. And that one thing is how acid or alkaline the given mucosal tissue is. So we actually have a microbiome in our nose. And just as a very brief aside, because I'd be remiss if I didn't say this, if you emphasize nasal breathing most of the time, except when speaking or eating. And if you downplay mouth breathing, meaning you refrain from mouth breathing, especially in sleep, you improve the nasal microbiome. It gets better at fighting off infections. This was shown in a beautiful paper, published in Cell Reports last year. And that paper I should mention was performed in humans. So you've got a microbiome in your nose and my nasal breathing most of the time, not all the time. Cause there going to be times when you need to breathe through your mouth for whatever reason, hard exercise or eating or speaking, but by breathing through your nose, most of the time you are creating an additional layer of immune defense against particles that could get you sick. Whereas when you mouth breathe, you are taking down a layer of defense and you are putting yourself more at risk of infection. This is what this paper shows. You also have a gut microbiome that is in your throat, in your stomach and in your intestines. And that gut microbiome is extremely powerful in regulating your mood and your immune function. Now, this is not something that you can sense directly. You don't know when you have a bunch of good microbiota or a bunch of bad microbiota because you can feel them moving around in there, actually that would be pretty awful, that would be pretty creepy feeling. Rather that according to whether or not your gut is alkaline or acidic in the appropriate ways, you will populate your gut with the appropriate microbiota. So you want your stomach to be pretty acidic, but other elements of your digestive tract are going to be more pH. And basically there's a gradient, meaning there's a low to high pH gradient along the gut. You don't have to know what the pH should be at any one given point, because you're not going to go and put microbiota at one location and not another. What you essentially want to do is create an environment where the proper can thrive, because when you do that, you greatly decrease what are called inflammatory cytokines. So these are things that are secreted both by cells, within the body and cells within the brain to impact brain health and brain function and bodily health. They go by particular name, so there's something called TNF alpha, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha. It is inflammatory. It's not a good thing to have at elevated levels. You have something called Interleukin Six, IL-6 also causes inflammation, causes damage to tissues, not a good thing to have elevated for long periods of time. And then you have anti-inflammatory cytokines, things like Interleukin 10, which reduce inflammation. And there are hundreds of these, if not thousands of these different cytokines, some of which promote inflammation, some of which reduce inflammation. The simple way to adjust these things in the proper ratios is to adjust your gut microbiome. The best way to adjust your microbiome is to ingest certain types of foods. So there is a beautiful literature on this now, but the most important literature is the one that I referred to at the beginning of this episode, which is what to ingest and what not to ingest in terms of foods in order to create the best conditions in your gut so that you can create the best conditions in your brain and body. There was a study done by my colleague, Justin Sonnenberg at Stanford School of Medicine. Justin's actually my upstairs neighbor in the building at Stanford where I work and they explored how different foods or different diets, I should say, impact the gut microbiome and inflammatory markers. And this is a beautiful study because it was done in hundreds of human patients. These actually weren't patients that were sick, I should say human subjects that were otherwise healthy from a huge variety of backgrounds, so you had men, you had women, you had people of different races, different ethnicities. You had a huge range of backgrounds and they tracked all of that. And what they did is they explored two types of diets. One is a high fiber diet. So dietary fibers are non-digestible are only partially digestible carbohydrates typically. And they compared that to diets that were unchanged, except for the inclusion of a few, to a few more servings of fermented foods, each day, things like sauerkraut, things like kimchi, they even explored, it sounds pretty disgusting to me, but who knows, I've never tried it, which is fermented cottage cheese. And what they found was that after initial period of a few weeks, where they had people either eat a lot of fiber or eat one or two servings of fermented foods, they had those people ramp up their ingestion of either fiber or fermented foods, so they kind of ease them into it. As they went baseline then ramp up to the point where they were ingesting, you know, four or five servings of fiber or of fermented foods per day, which sounds like a lot. But for fermented foods, that would be, you know, four or five tablespoons of sauerkraut or kimchi. It's not quite, it's not like huge platefuls of fermented foods. And then they looked at a number of things. They looked at the proteome, which is a kind of like looking at the genome, but a bunch of proteins that are made in the body. And they did this by fecal samples, by stool samples, and they did this by blood draw, which is great, it's a real power of this study. In fact, the most comprehensive study that I'm aware of. By looking at these different tissues across long periods of time, so many weeks, and then returning people to their, to the diet that they were on before they went into the study, they will were able to establish in a causal way, how ingesting fibers or fibrous foods versus ingesting these fermented foods on a daily basis could impact the gut microbiome and many inflammatory markers and many markers of immune function and auto immune function. And the takeaway message from this study is that the fermented foods far out performed the high fiber diet. In fact, the high fiber diet in some people was beneficial and in other people caused issues with inflammation. This is very different than what I was taught growing up and what many of us were taught. Interestingly they also observed that people that ate the high fiber diet had increases in certain enzymes that lend themselves to better digestion of carbohydrates. And I think there's an important insight to come from this. Nowadays we kind of live in the age of extremes where people seem to either want to be carnivore or like never ingest a vegetable, I hear they don't even like allow pepper, but they're not even allowed, you know, sauerkraut or something like very extreme or pure plant based, pure vegan or pure. So essentially pure carbohydrate or pure animal protein, very extreme. I'm an omnivore, I like to eat a mixture of different things at different times of days, but very extreme, but this is interesting because what this, what these data show is that perhaps ingesting a high carbohydrate high fiber diet, which is really what these, the high-fiber condition really was actually makes people better at digesting carbohydrates. This may explain why people who are used to a, kind of a more paleo type or carnivore type diet might eat carbohydrates and say, oh, that doesn't work for me, I don't feel good. It might also explain why people who predominantly eat plant-based foods and carbohydrate foods will try eating meat as an experiment, or because they lost a bet or whatever it is and they'll do or desperation, or they'll do that. And then they'll say, oh, I don't feel good when I eat meat. How good you feel, it seems how well you can utilize that food, and how much of that food you crave may be determined in fact, it appears is determined by your food eating history, the types of food you eat. And I think this might explain some of the divide and hopefully might bridge some of the chasm between these different groups that are saying it should be one way, or it should be another. But at the core of the study was the bigger message. The bigger message is that all of us should be ingesting on a regular basis, daily basis, two to four servings of fermented foods of different kinds. And why I say that is because the inflammatory markers went down, the markers of auto-immune disruption went down, and the chemistry of the gut therefore was adjusted in the appropriate ways. Now it's not to say that high fiber is bad or that fiber is bad, I don't want people to confuse this, but even though this is a discussion about interoception, about sensing the self. This is a subconscious mechanism by which the gut communicates to many organs, including the brain. And it's been shown in other studies also in quality peer review journals that when the correct gut microbiota are present and these inflammatory markers are reduced, cognition improves so ability to focus, ability to sleep ability to ward off infection and wound healing all enhanced, in fact, even in autism spectrum disorder, in people that struggle with various mental conditions or disorders of the mind improving the gut microbiome seems to have powerful effects on improving brain symptoms. Along the lines of auto-immunity, there are a number of conditions that we call auto-immune conditions, and we will do entire episodes about these going forward. But for people with so-called irritable bowel syndrome, for people with Crohn's disease, for people with leaky gut, Hashimoto's, which is a kind of an immune system self-attack on one's thyroid gland and things like eczema, skin conditions, adjusting the gut microbiome has been shown to be useful in positively adjusting the symptoms of all of those, will it fix those conditions entirely? Probably not. But can it have a significant positive impact on them? Probably, yes. There is one thing that's worth mentioning in that list, which is leaky gut, what is leaky gut. Here, we're talking about the guts, what is it to have a leaky gut, it sounds awful. It sounds like something sort of like leaking out the end of the tube, and it maybe that too, I don't know. But leaky gut is actually because, your gut is not a tube that's continuous, one cell it's actually made up of many cells and those cells form a barrier and they form what are called tight junctions. If you have two cells and you want to create a fence out of those cells, you bind them together. The way that the body does this is to bind them together with what are called tight junctions, these are, they go by names like claudins and things like that, if you want to look them up. These tight junctions form a nice barrier, like a cyclone fence, that things can't get past, but like a cyclone fence only molecules of a certain size can go through those holes. So you're not going to pass a soccer ball through an intact cyclone fence, but you could pass for instance, a feather through that fence. So leaky gut is when the conditions in the gut are too alkaline or the gut microbiota are off in the gut, meaning microbiota that like alkaline guts are living there. And those tight junctions can't function at that particular pH and you create little holes in that fence. And then what happens is when you ingest foods, some of those foods literally leak out of the gut and into the extracellular space and into the bloodstream. And because foods include proteins and antibodies react to proteins, what ends up happening in leaky gut, and the reason we talk about in auto-immune conditions is that you start developing antibodies to particular food proteins. And then people start feeling like they have food allergies and they do, they actually create particular food allergies. Now, one way to prevent leaky gut is to get the rest of the gut situation happy by ingesting the proper foods that we talked about before, ingesting fermented foods on a regular basis. The other is our old friend glutamine, again. There are some data and I should say it's a limited number of studies showing that ingesting glutamine anywhere from one to three, excuse me, teaspoons per day, can help alleviate leaky gut. Now, the mechanism for that still isn't clear whether or not it's adjusting pH or whether or not it's creating more favorable environment for the microbiota, but it is clear that supplementing with glutamine can, in some people enhance where I should say improve conditions of leaky gut, so that might be useful as well. And then the final thing about this, I want to talk about is we're talking about chemical sensing in the gut and how that impacts wellbeing is about gut acidity, and this I confess is a little bit controversial. Some people are on board, this other people are not. And so I'd love your feedback on this, if you, if you agree, please tell me if you disagree, please tell me, but please tell me why you disagree in particular, experience or data, although it's always better if you can point me towards peer reviewed studies. There is a practice that some people embrace. I'm not recommending people necessarily do this. And you would definitely want to talk to your doctor, but where people have food allergies or they're having mood or auto-immune issues, and they treat this, some people recommend treating this through the ingestion of HCL, hydrochloric acid tablets. Now hydrochloric acid can burn you, right? Acids can burn you, they literally can melt away skin. You want to be very careful with acids of all kinds, truly, but hydrochloric acid is sold as in supplement form in capsule or pill form. And there is a practice of starting to ingest one or two hydrochloric acid tablets midway through a meal and then what people will generally do is examine to see whether or not that improves their symptoms of indigestion, how it relates to mood, how it relates to well-being, how it relates to their sensation of their gut viscera. By changing the acidity, you also changed the way that the gut communicates with the brain through the mechanisms we talked about before. And there are a growing number of people embracing these practices of taking HCL. It's often combined with other things, it's usually combined with an enzyme and that enzyme is pepsin. So most of these supplements come in the form betaine HCL pepsin and while they're not a cure-all, and certainly don't want to suggest that they're a cure-all, many people that have a hard time adjusting the pH of their gut and have a hard time adjusting the microbiota of their gut in the appropriate ways have benefited from taking these betaine HCL pepsin tablets or capsules during meals. And the general instruction is to start slow, to start with one or two, and then to find a level that you're comfortable with that doesn't create an excessive feeling of warmth in the stomach, it doesn't throw off your digestion. So it takes a little bit of experimentation, again, definitely talk to your healthcare provider before exploring this, but this has become a very common practice for people with auto-immune disorders and accessing the gut because it is accessible by taking things has also become way in which people with various mental conditions are trying to adjust their mood and adjust their wellbeing. Along these lines, I do want to mention that there are studies that show that people that supplement with a lot of probiotics or even prebiotics can sometimes experience brain fog. This isn't discussed a lot and the data are a little all over the place, but it is that we're thinking about. The goal here is not to create as many microbiota as possible, what you want is microbiota diversity. And I should mention this again in reference to the Sonnenberg study, which was what the high fiber diet does is it increases certain microbiota, but it limits their diversity and what the fermented food diet does, or I should say the diet that includes regular ingestion of fermented foods a few servings a day is it increases microbiota diversity. Now, lack of microbiota diversity has a name in the medical profession. It's called dysbiosis and dysbiosis is bad. Dysbiosis is what you see when people are spending long periods of time on bedrest or when they've been chronically ill, and so here again, we're talking about creating a positive environment in the gut, either by adjusting acidity, maybe you explore the betaine HCL pepsin thing. I think if you have healthy digestion, if you feel like you have a good relationship to your gut, and it has a good relationship to you, sort of a silly phrase, because it is you and you are it, then I don't think there's any need to pursue this, but if you don't, that might be one avenue to pursue. However I think primary in all of this is the fermented food findings, and it's not just one study, it's many many findings that now bring us to a place where a huge center of massive data are pointing us in the direction of saying ingest fermented foods on a regular basis. I should also mention that conditions like sarcopenia, which is the loss of muscle tissue as we age, has been shown to be offset by improving the gut microbiota. So while today is about interoception, we're talking about sensing, we're also talking about subconscious sensing. What are we talking about, subconscious sensing, we're talking about subconscious sensing of the milieu of the body. When the milieu of the gut and the body is right, than the brain and the immune system function very well. And so this isn't something where you can sit back and say, oh, you know, I feel all those good microbiota in my gut, or, oh, no, those are bad microbiota. You can't do that unless you're going to take fecal samples and blood samples and analyze them in the, with the extreme exhaustive nature that the Sonnenberg and other labs do, you're not going to get that kind of information. I know there are companies out there that do this, and I don't want to knock on any of them, but I do want to emphasize that to do this right, to really analyze which cytokines you're making, which ones you're not, you really need to look at a huge number of them. And that requires large-scale proteomic and genomic and inflammatory markers screens. It's just not the kind of thing that most commercial enterprises can really provide to people in a way that they can interpret, rather, this is a case where you can simply go to the effector, to the thing that can actually move the needle in the right direction for you. It's very clear that's fermented foods and that's keeping the stomach slightly more acid than one might think you would want to. So let's talk about barfing first. Barfing, AKA vomiting, is when the contents of your guts run in reverse, meaning when they go up from your stomach. Sometimes even up from the intestines, even though that sounds horrible, it sometimes happens up, out the esophagus and mouth and onto whatever surface happens to be in front of you. It's a terrible thing, nobody likes to do it, but it's a very interesting aspect of our biology because it reveals a beautiful and absolutely fundamental relationship between our chemistry and our brain. So your brain is actually locked behind a gate and that gate is not your skull. That gate is the so-called blood-brain barrier. So just like your gut has these epithelial tight junctions, the things I talked about before that provide a fence, so things can't get through and get through in leaky gut, your brain has tight junctions that are very tight. It's absolutely fundamental that only certain molecules get across the blood brain barrier and that others don't. And the reason for that is that most all 99.99999% of your neurons do not regenerate, I don't care what you've read, especially in the news recently about how psychedelics cause neurogenesis, because they don't, it's absolutely wrong. Psychedelics have effects on brain plasticity, but they have nothing to do with neurogenesis, at least no data to support it, but because you can't make new neurons, you also can't damage the ones you've got, or you shouldn't as much as possible. And that's why you have a blood brain barrier or a BBB. So the BBB as it's called prevents substances from getting to the brain, however, like any fence, it is not always uniform along its length. And there are little spots within that fence where chemicals can sneak across to the brain and through a beautiful design, I don't know anything about the design. As I always say, I wasn't consulted the design phase. I'm not talking about any kind of intelligent design or anything that is not the topic of this podcast. This is not a philosophy podcast, nor is it a religion podcast, it's a science podcast, but through a beautiful design of some sort, there are little holes in that fence. And they're little neurons that sit right behind those holes and those neurons sense what the chemistry of the blood is. So I'm guessing you probably didn't imagine that today's discussion about sensing the self would be sensing your own blood, but you do. There's a little area of your brain, that's little indeed, but is very important called area postrema P-O-S-T-R-E-M-A. And area postrema is an area of the brainstem that sits right next to another brain area called the chemo receptor trigger zone. And when the contents in your bloodstream are of a particular kind, meaning when there are pathogens or it's too acidic, the neurons and area postrema the neurons in the chemo receptor trigger zone, the CTZ as it's called, trigger a bunch of motor reflexes in the abdominal wall that make you barf. Okay, the feeling that you need to throw up is triggered by these neurons in the brain stem. And those neurons in the brainstem are triggered by the presence of certain chemicals. And the reason why you don't have any blood brain barrier at that location is because post-trauma has to be there like a crossing guard, making sure that everything that's coming through the blood is okay, and if it even senses just the tiniest bit, that things are off, it's going to trigger that reflex. Now, the really interesting thing is that the neurons and area postrema respond to the chemistry of the blood, but they also will respond to our consciousness, to things that we think and things that we believe and even particular memories. This is why when certain people see vomit or see someone else vomit, or even somebody else heaving, as if they're going to vomit, they themselves feel as if they're going to vomit. I'm guessing they're probably even a few of you right now that feel like you might vomit. You might feel salivation in your throat, which is always a precursor to vomiting. Some people, the memory of, or the thought of something like blood or vomit or, use your imagination, can actually trigger the vomit reflex. And that's because these neurons in area are very sensitive to prior experience of interactions with negative things. So and actually, as I'm saying this, I feel my gut kind of cramping up again, I'm not, I don't vomit very easily, I'm not one of those, nor am I somebody who's never vomited. And here we are talking about my vomit history, but I think it's appropriate in this, in this context, the neurons of area, or they're basically to keep your whole system safe and thank goodness they are, because for instance, some people, unfortunately, they drink so much alcohol that they throw up. Have you ever wondered why that is? Well it's because alcohol fundamentally is a poison. I'm not saying for, you know, age appropriate folks that ingesting alcohol is bad. This isn't a judgment call, but alcohol itself at excessive levels in the bloodstream triggers post-trauma to cause vomiting. So this is an example, whereby memories, context, but also just the chemistry of our internal state is triggering behaviors that are very hardwired. They're very reflux driven. And why would it be that some people get more nauseous than others at a given level, well, they'll have to do with alcohol tolerance. Some people have what's called a, you know, we refer to as a stronger stomach or a stomach of steel. Other people they throw out very easily if they don't feel well, or if they ingest anything that's just a little bit off. From a purely adaptive standpoint, it's probably better to vomit up things that aren't good for you rather than to have them pass through your system. Especially if those things are contained in lipids. For instance if you ingest something that's in liquid form because cells, literally every cell in your body is surrounded by a little thin layer of fatty tissue, we call the bilayer membrane, it's a little membrane. Fat can move through fat very easily. And so any bad stuff you ingest can get stuck in your system. So let's talk for a second about how to reduce nausea, because nausea is that salivation, that feeling that you're going to vomit, can be very beneficial in an, in an adaptive circumstance. Like you've ingested something bad, but some people experience nausea, for other reasons, there are good ways to regulate nausea and the ways they regulate nausea, very interesting. They actually adjust the activity of these neurons in area postrema or they change the chemistry of the blood directly. And many of you have heard this before, perhaps, but it turns out that there are good data, 11 research studies where the ones that I could find peer reviewed research studies with no bias, so independent studies showing that ginger can cause a notable reduction in nausea, how much ginger, one to three grams, what's one to three grams where you have to measure it out on a scale, unless you're taking it in pill or capsule form. It doesn't seem to matter if you take it in pill or capsule form, so this thing that you've heard before that ginger can reduce nausea, indeed is true. Peppermint, apparently can also do that. And some of you will not be surprised to learn that cannabis can reduce nausea, not surprise because cannabis, which has different legality in different places, and I understand that, so please take that into consideration. But cannabis, THC and, or it turns out CBD can reduce nausea, that's been shown in at least one study. And it probably does that, not by changing the chemistry of your blood, but by changing the threshold for firing of these neurons in area post-trauma. And there are conditions such as in chemotherapy and radiation therapy and others where people are feeling very nauseous, I'm not recommending people go use cannabis, unless they've decided with their selves and their family and their doctor that they should. But what's interesting is this thing about CBD and we'll do a whole episode on THC and CBD doesn't have, or isn't supposed to have these psychoactive properties that THC does. Although CBD can have a mild to major anxiolytic anxiety-reducing effect, but it does appear that the data are what the data support. I should say, the anecdotal reports, which are that cannabis can reduce nausea. So to barf less, ginger, peppermint, and if appropriate and legal for you, possibly cannabis. Now let's talk about fever. In previous episodes, and in future episodes, we deal with thermal regulation, which is the body's ability to regulate its temperature. Talk about cold and heat and saunas and ice baths and physical performance. We're not going to deal with all that right now, but I promise we will going forward. Today, I only want to talk about fever because fever directly relates to interoception. What do I mean by that? Well, a fever is simply an increase in body temperature, that increase in body temperature is triggered by neurons in the brain. And those neurons in the brain are triggered by the presence of particular things in the bloodstream. What sorts of things? Well, toxins, bacteria, viruses, when something bad gets in our system, the body doesn't know it's bad, it just knows it's foreign, and it hasn't seen it before. Or that it's in the wrong compartment of the body. So earlier we were talking about proteins that leak out of the gut and get elsewhere, you know, you don't want a piece of steak sitting in your bicep. That would be bad, you would actually develop antibodies, you would have a horrible infection. But your body has this intelligence, and that intelligence is to know, Hmm, these proteins are normally not seen in this region and then your body or the cells there, I should say, we'll release something that then will travel to the brain and will trigger an increase in body temperature so that your body cooks the bad thing or the cause of the bad thing. It's really a beautiful adaptive mechanism. We always think fever is so terrible, but fever is there to cook the bad thing that's inside you, or that has left the correct compartment inside you and is in the wrong compartment inside you. So what's beautiful about the fever mechanism is that it looks a lot like the barfing mechanism. Basically you have a set of neurons that sit near the ventricles, remember the ventrals is hole in the tube, that is you, the tube that is, you are a tube, a series of tubes. And your brain has a hole down the middle. And it extends down to the bottom of your spinal cord, at the front, it's called the ventricles, they start with what are called the lateral ventricles and the excuse me, starts with the third and the lateral ventricles, and then it goes to the fourth ventricle and then to what's called the central canal. But basically is just a big space in the middle of your nervous system in the middle of your brain. And you have one ventricle that I already mentioned called the third ventricle. And it's shaped kind of like a thin oval up upright, if you're listening to this, just think an I, the shape of an I, but it's kind of rotated 90 degrees. So it's up and down as opposed to across. And along that third ventricle, there's there a little neurons that can sense what's in the cerebral spinal fluid that fills the ventricle. So in other words, you have neurons that are sensing the chemistry of your cerebral spinal fluid, and that have access therefore to the chemistry of your body. Because that cerebral spinal fluid is going up and down the brain and spinal cord. But into that cerebral spinal fluid are signals about the various chemicals within the body. So this is not a mechanical system. This is a chemical system. Remember we're talking about mechanical information and chemical information accessing the brain. So if you have something bad in your system, you've ingested a, you breathe in a virus or you inhaled some bacteria, or you got a cut on your leg and some bacteria are growing there. Of course, locally, there will be effects, little things called the mast cell. This M-A-S-T little packets of histamine literally will go there and explode [poofs] and cause inflammation, which is actually a good inflammation. And we'll release little things called macrophages to gobble up the infection. The other day, it was in Texas, it was some mean little mosquitoes in Texas, and a lot of them, and I would stand outside and I'd get bitten, I didn't feel a thing, but then later that night, they started swelling up and itching and then I'd itch them, and then they'd swell even more. That was because of the release of mass cells, of histamines inside those mass cells that would literally causing inflammation of the tissue. It wasn't the poison from the mosquito itself. It was the immune response to those. Well, you also have this systemic or body-wide attempt to kill stuff, and that's the fever. So the neurons that these ventricles with cerebral spinal fluid go by a particular name, they're called circumventricular organs, meaning near circum, ventricular near the ventricles. And you have these organs and there are a set of neurons, has a really cool name called the OVLT. I don't know why I like that, but I just like it, it's the organum vasculosum of the lateral terminalis organum vasculosum of the lateral terminalis, OVLT are the neurons that respond to toxins and bad stuff in your bloodstream, however minor or major. And they release things like ILK-1, which are inflammatory cytokines inflammatory in this case is good, you want inflammation at the site of an infection. It's a good thing. It's going to help with healing. And it's going to change the conditions in your body, what's going to happen is when those OVLT neurons are activated, because you have something bad in your body or something bad is happening in your body, they communicate with an area of the brain called the preoptic area of your hypothalamus and the preoptic area cranks up your temperature and tries to cook that bad thing. Now it's worth talking about fever for a moment and talking about thermal regulation, because I think this actually could save some lives. So if you are overheated to a point where, you know, you're getting up past 102 or 103, it's going to vary depending on person to person and certainly age, you know, kids, some people think can tolerate higher levels of fever than adults, but look, you always want to be cautious about heating up the brain too much, because once those neurons are gone, they do not come back and neurons do not do well in very high temperatures. Once your body temperature starts getting up to 102, 103, certainly 104, you are starting to enter serious danger zone. This can happen through exercise in hot environments or an inability to escape heat because you don't have covering or adequate ventilation or cooling. It can also be because of excessive fever, for whatever reason. A lot of people think the way to deal with this is to put a cool compress on the back of the neck or to cool the torso. In discussing this with my colleague, Craig Heller who's at Stanford School of Medicine, and he's on the undergraduate side of the campus as well, runs a biology lab. He's a world expert in thermal regulation. It's very clear that that's the wrong response to try and cool off the body. If you put a cold towel or you put an ice pack on the back of the neck, what you effectively do is cool the blood that's going to the brain. And if you do that, then your brain will react by turning up the crank in so to speak on the neurons in the pre optic area, and will heat you up further and can cook your brain and organs further. So what you want to do is, as I've talked about before, you want to cool the bottoms of the feet, the palms of the hands and the upper part of the face. And I'm not going to go into all the details as to why you want to do that right now, but those are the locations you want to cool. Now you can also cool the rest of the body, but it's not okay to just stay under the covers and just cool, you know, the neck or something like that. You really want to try and create a systemic or whole body cooling, if the goal is to bring fever down, but in many cases, fever is adaptive. And so taking a non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs like Advil and Tylenol sometimes can be good, if that's recommended, but other times, because it reduces your fever, it's allowing that pathogen, that pyrogen, it's sometimes called, a pyrogen is a substance that causes fever, think pyro, think fire, think pyromaniacs, think pyro, those pyrogens can survive at moderate to low temperatures, and they can't survive at high temperatures. So the fever is an adaptive mechanism and the OVLT, and the sensing of your chemistry is how the OVLT, organum vasculosum of the lateral terminalis does that. So we've talked about sensing lung volume, speed of our heartbeat, we talked about sensing the gut volume, the intestinal volume, or the absence of volume. We talked about chemistry of the gut and the gut microbiota and auto immune functions. And we've now talked about vomiting, and we've talked about fever, lots of aspects of sensing our internal self. Now I want to turn our attention to interoception as it relates to feelings, the way that interoception is most commonly described. And I want to highlight a term that many of you have probably heard, which is the vagus nerve. We talked about vagus a little bit earlier, but the vagus nerve, this vagabonding wandering nerve is involved in everything I've talked about up until now. And the reason I saved it till now, rather than mentioning all along is to highlight a specific point, which is that whenever we hear about the vagus in popular culture, it's like the vagus calms you down, you want to stimulate the vagus by rubbing in front of the ear, and it's a parasympathetic nerve, and it will calm you down, he'll mellow you out. Actually, most of the time, the vagus is stimulatory. When you ingest foods with amino acids, sugars, or fatty acids, the vagus nerve gets activated and triggers the release of dopamine, it makes you more alert and go seek more of those foods or what led to those conditions. When you feel nauseous it's rarely calming, when you feel like you have a fever, it's rarely calming. So you're starting to get the picture that even though the vagus nerve is in the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system. And if that doesn't mean anything to you, because you're not in aficionado, don't worry about it. But it's not a calming system, it's a communication system, and it's a motor system. It communicates brain to body and body to brain, and it changes the function of different organs, now, one thing that's important to highlight is that stress itself will alter the chemistry of your gut because of the ways that it down the vagus nerve and quiets the neurons that communicate from gut to brain. I want to say that again, stress will disrupt your gut and make you feel not good, poor digestion, and just lousy, because of the way that it shuts down the vagus nerve and the neurons of your gut. So what stress does is it blocks the communication between gut and brain, it doesn't mess up your gut. It just doesn't let your gut get the signals up to your brain, and it also then throws off the chemistry. And then there's a whole cascade of effects. If you want to learn more about stress, I did a whole episode called \\\"Master Stress,\\\" or I think maybe it was called \\\"Conquer Stress\\\" and it was \\\"Master Stress,\\\" either one. The whole point of that episode is to give you tools and practices to deal with short term, acute stress, moderate term stress, and long-term chronic stress through behavioral mechanisms, nutrition, supplementation, and many other things as well. It's chockablock full of protocols and tools for stress. The vagus nerve, however, is responsible for emotion and the way it does that is to pool, to aggregate the conditions of your gut, the conditions of your heart and the conditions of your breathing, which includes your diaphragm and lungs and takes that kind of as a collection of information and sends it to the brain and controls what we call your emotions. Now that might seem obvious to some people, but to other people that might seem totally crazy. You thought your emotions were because the market was down and you had invested, or because something that you thought was going to happen is not going to happen, or because you thought that school was open and then it's not, or maybe thought it wasn't, and it is whatever it is that bothers you, you think of generally as a purely cognitive event. But the brain doesn't really know what to do with that information. It doesn't act directly on that information to create moods. Moods are created through the heart's response to reading that headline, to the change in your breathing, that's caused by someone that you love telling you that actually they're not interested in spending time with you anymore, or that you screwed up or that they're interested in spending a lot of time with you and you like that, right? Emotions can be good or bad or neutral. So this thing that we call interoception, the sense of self I've been building up from very fundamental layers, gut chemistry, spleens, immune systems, auto-immune and you might've been thinking, wait, I thought this was going to be about a sense of self, a noticing or a feeling. And indeed all of those things are plugging in like a series of ingredients in a recipe that gives rise to your mood and how you feel, and that mood and how you feel is shown in one location in your body that other people can see. And that's in your facial expressions. And indeed there are now beautiful data showing that your face, including the size of your pupils, the tonality of your face, how flushed you are, or how pale you are, even the degree to which you're frowning or smiling relative to other periods of time, that is all an aggregate of, or a reflection rather of your gut, your heart and your breathing and the chemistry of your body. And so this is why I sort of backed into this conversation about interoception I kind of Trojan horse this on you on purpose which is that when we talk about the vagus and you hear, oh, you know, you can get vagal tone by breathing or rubbing on the front of the or short that's probably true, but another fundamental layer is the acidity of your gut, how fast your breathing are you inhale-emphasized, or exhale-emphasized breathing. When we are relaxed our pupils tend to constrict. When we are very alert, our pupils tend to be dilated, whether or not that alertness has to do with being happy or being sad. And what's remarkable, and this is where interoception really takes a leap into the incredible is that there are beautiful studies that show that for instance, when we know somebody pretty well and they are going through some sort of experience of any kind, our heart rate actually starts to mimic their heart rate. Our breathing starts to mimic their breathing, even if we aren't conscious of their breathing. It's not like we see their chest heaving, and we think, oh my goodness, and then we breathe that way. There's a mirroring and no it's not carried out through mirror neurons. Mirror neurons are more of a myth and a reality, sorry to burst people's bubbles. But that bubble around mirror neurons is definitely made of myths and a topic for another time, but we start to mirror. Somehow human beings are able to register the internal state of other beings, and I think probably for animals too, but certainly for other humans, even at a distance. And these studies are many now, and they're really wonderful studies. And so your sense of your internal landscape is linked to others. Now you can enhance this interoceptive capacity for how you feel and how others feel, in other words, you can start getting a better readout of your internal state by doing a simple exercise, what is really a tool. And that is to learn to sense your heartbeats. So some people are very good at this, other people are not, some people can do this more easily when they have all their air exhaled and some people can do it better when they are holding a breath hold. But one thing that's kind of cool about this whole interoceptive capacity is that you can enhance it very quickly. You can learn or teach yourself to have heightened levels of interoception in a way that you can't really just give yourself heightened levels of vision by snapping your fingers, in one of one tool or exercise, there are things you can do to improve vision. That's the topic of a previous episode. I encourage you to look it up. There are things you can do to improve your hearing and your taste and your smell, we talked about all those, but with interoception you can get very good at this very fast. And I think this is one of the reasons why meditation is powerful. Think there are a lot of reasons why meditation is powerful, but one of the reasons is when you stop taking in exteroceptive information from the outside world, by closing your eyes and focusing inward, as they say, you start paying attention to your breathing cadence, you start directing your mind's attention to your heart rate, and if you can start to perceive your heart beating. You actually are very quickly strengthen the vagal connections between the body and the brain. And so there's no real practice here. There's no breathe this way or do this thing except to direct your awareness toward your heartbeat. And some people can get very good at this very fast. Most people find that just by doing this for a minute or so, every once in a while, they start to tap into this sixth sense. They start to notice when they don't feel quite right about something or somebody or some situation, or they start to notice when they feel quite right about somebody or something or some situation. So this interoceptive awareness can be tuned up. It used to be called vagal tone, but I think that term doesn't take into account all the other things that are going on with the vagus. So I don't really like that term. It's more of an interoceptive awareness. And again, there are many studies now showing that for sake of bettering one's mood overall, for sake of moving through a challenging phase in life, for sake of just enhancing one's experience of life overall, whether or not it's the taste of foods, interactions with other people, enjoyment, focus, pleasure, tuning up one's interoceptive awareness is both easy again by just taking a minute or two and trying to count heartbeats. And then this works best, of course, if you have some independent readout of heartbeats and you can compare, you can see how accurate you are, but even if you don't use a device or have a device to do that, without taking your pulse, using your thumb on your wrist or something, or your fingers on your neck, as you typically would for taking your pulse, trying to sit still for a minute or two every once in a while, maybe once a week, maybe twice a week, maybe while you're meditating, maybe while breathwork, maybe during the breath holds of breathwork, you don't really have to do this in any kind of extended way, you can very quickly increase your interoceptive tone. And that has a huge and outsized effect on the brain, body relationship and your brain's ability to tap into both the subconscious and the conscious aspects of this chemical and mechanical signaling that's happening all the time. And it can have real and out-sized positive effects on your ability to engage with other people and your ability to focus at work and your ability to notice, ah, I'm finding myself kind of feeling like I'm losing focus, but really it was my heart rate was just increasing. Maybe I just exhale a little bit and bring my heart rate down. So whatever effectually tried to do today is to give you a window into this incredible relationship between your viscera and your brain and your brain and your viscera, all these organs of your body, and what I hope is that you'll appreciate that it's a system, that you aren't just a system of tubes. I said that in a sort of in jest, I mean, you have a lot of tubes and you are a system of tubes, but that system of tubes is linked through the nervous system, and those links work in very specific ways. So whether or not you remember about pesos and all the GLPRs and all that stuff, it doesn't really matter. What I encourage you to do is start sort of pushing and pulling on the various leavers within this beautiful system that we call the interoceptive system, this sense of self.

During the course of today's episode, and on previous episodes, I mentioned supplements. I realized supplements aren't for everybody, but for those of you that are interested in supplements, it is important that the supplements that you take have a high level of stringency with respect to the amounts of the contents that are listed on the bottle matching what's actually in the bottle, in the capsules and tablets, and that the quality of those ingredients be extremely high. For that reason we partnered with Thorne, that's T-H-O-R-N-E because Thorne supplements have the highest levels of stringency for both the content and the amount of content in those bottles and supplements. If you want to try Thorne supplements, and you want to see the supplements that I take, you can go to thorne.com/U/Huberman. And you can see all the supplements that I take.

[upbeat music]\",\n          \"[bright music] - Welcome to the \\\"Huberman Lab Podcast,\\\" where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a Professor of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today I have the pleasure of introducing Dr. Lex Fridman as our guest on the \\\"Huberman Lab Podcast.\\\" Dr. Fridman is a researcher at MIT specializing in machine learning, artificial intelligence and human robot interactions. I must say that the conversation with Lex was without question, one of the most fascinating conversations that I've ever had, not just in my career, but in my lifetime. I knew that Lex worked on these topics. And I think many of you are probably familiar with Lex and his interest in these topics from his incredible podcast, the \\\"Lex Fridman Podcast.\\\" If you're not already watching that podcast, please subscribe to it. It is absolutely fantastic. But in holding this conversation with Lex, I realized something far more important. He revealed to us a bit of his dream. His dream about humans and robots, about humans and machines, and about how those interactions can change the way that we perceive ourselves and that we interact with the world. We discuss relationships of all kinds, relationships with animals, relationships with friends, relationships with family and romantic relationships. And we discuss relationships with the machines. Machines that move and machines that don't move, and machines that come to understand us in ways that we could never understand for ourselves, and how those machines can educate us about ourselves. Before this conversation, I had no concept of the ways in which machines could inform me or anyone about themselves. By the end, I was absolutely taken with the idea, and I'm still taken with the idea that interactions with machines have a very particular kind, a kind that Lex understands and wants to bring to the world, can not only transform the self, but may very well transform humanity. So whether or not you're familiar with Dr. Lex Fridman or not, I'm certain you're going to learn a tremendous amount from him during the course of our discussion, and that it will transform the way that you think about yourself and about the world. Before we begin, I want to mention that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is ROKA. ROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses that are of absolutely phenomenal quality. The company was founded by two All-American swimmers from Stanford, and everything about the sunglasses and eyeglasses they've designed had performance in mind. I've spent a career working on the visual system. And one of the fundamental issues that your visual system has to deal with is how to adjust what you see when it gets darker or brighter in your environment. With ROKA Sunglasses and Eyeglasses, whether or not it's dim in the room or outside, or not there's cloud cover, or whether or not you walk into a shadow, you can always see the world with absolute clarity. And that just tells me that they really understand the way that the visual system works. Processes like habituation and attenuation. All these things that work at a real mechanistic level have been built into these glasses. In addition, the glasses are very lightweight. You don't even notice really that they're on your face. And the quality of the lenses is terrific. Now, the glasses were also designed so that you could use them, not just while working or at dinner, et cetera, but while exercising. They don't fall off your face or slip off your face if you're sweating. And as I mentioned, they're extremely lightweight. So you can use them while running, you can use them while cycling and so forth. Also the aesthetic of ROKA glasses is terrific. Unlike a lot of performance glasses out there, which frankly make people look like cyborgs, these glasses look great. You can wear them out to dinner, you can wear them for essentially any occasion. If you'd like to try ROKA glasses, you can go to roka.com. That's R-O-K-A .com and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your first order.

InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact our immediate and long-term health can only be assessed from a quality blood test. And now with the advent of quality DNA tests, we can also get insight into some of our genetic underpinnings of our current and long-term health. The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there, however, is you get the data back and you don't know what to do with those data. You see that certain things are high or certain things are low, but you really don't know what the actionable items are, what to do with all that information. With InsideTracker, they make it very easy to act in the appropriate ways on the information that you get back from those blood and DNA tests. And that's through the use of their online platform. They have a really easy to use dashboard that tells you what sorts of things can bring the numbers for your metabolic factors, endocrine factors, et cetera, into the ranges that you want and need for immediate and long-term health. In fact, I know one individual just by way of example, that was feeling good, but decided to go with an InsideTracker test and discovered that they had high levels of what's called C-reactive protein. They would have never detected that otherwise. C-reactive protein is associated with a number of deleterious health conditions, some heart issues, eye issues, et cetera. And so they were able to take immediate action to try and resolve those CRP levels. And so with InsideTracker, you get that sort of insight. And as I mentioned before, without a blood or DNA test, there's no way you're going to get that sort of insight until symptoms start to show up.

I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012. And so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens is that it covers all of my vitamin mineral probiotic basis. In fact, when people ask me, what should I take? I always suggest that the first supplement people take is Athletic Greens, for the simple reason, is that the things that contains covers your bases for metabolic health, endocrine health, and all sorts of other systems in the body. And the inclusion of probiotics are essential for a healthy gut microbiome. There are now tons of data showing that we have neurons in our gut, and keeping those neurons healthy requires that they are exposed to what are called the correct microbiota, little microorganisms that live in our gut and keep us healthy. And those neurons in turn help keep our brain healthy. They influence things like mood, our ability to focus, and many, many other factors related to health. With Athletic Greens, it's terrific, because it also tastes really good. I drink it once or twice a day. I mix mine with water and I add a little lemon juice, or sometimes a little bit of lime juice. If you want to try athletic greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman. And if you do that, you can claim their special offer. They're giving away five free travel packs, little packs that make it easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road. And they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3 and K2. Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman to claim that special offer. And now, my conversation with Dr. Lex Fridman. - We meet again. - We meet again. Thanks so much for sitting down with me. I have a question that I think is on a lot of people's minds or ought to be on a lot of people's minds, because we hear these terms a lot these days, but I think most people, including most scientists and including me don't know really what is artificial intelligence, and how is it different from things like machine learning and robotics? So, if you would be so kind as to explain to us, what is artificial intelligence, and what is machine learning? - Well, I think that question is as complicated and as fascinating as the question of, what is intelligence? So, I think of artificial intelligence, first, as a big philosophical thing. Pamela McCormick said AI was the ancient wish to forge the gods, or was born as an ancient wish to forge the gods. So I think at the big philosophical level, it's our longing to create other intelligence systems. Perhaps systems more powerful than us. At the more narrow level, I think it's also set of tools that are computational mathematical tools to automate different tasks. And then also it's our attempt to understand our own mind. So, build systems that exhibit some intelligent behavior in order to understand what is intelligence in our own selves. So all of those things are true. Of course, what AI really means as a community, as a set of researchers and engineers, it's a set of tools, a set of computational techniques that allow you to solve various problems. There's a long history that approaches the problem from different perspectives. What's always been throughout one of the threads, one of the communities goes under the flag of machine learning, which is emphasizing in the AI space, the task of learning. How do you make a machine that knows very little in the beginning, follow some kind of process and learns to become better and better at a particular task? What's been most very effective in the recent about 15 years is a set of techniques that fall under the flag of deep learning that utilize neural networks. When your networks are these fascinating things inspired by the structure of the human brain, very loosely, but they have a, it's a network of these little basic computational units called neurons, artificial neurons. And they have, these architectures have an input and output. They know nothing in the beginning, and their task with learning something interesting. What that's something interesting is, usually involves a particular task. There's a lot of ways to talk about this and break this down. Like one of them is how much human supervision is required to teach this thing. So supervised learning is broad category, is the neural network knows nothing in the beginning and then it's given a bunch of examples in computer vision that will be examples of cats, dogs, cars, traffic signs, and then you're given the image and you're given the ground truth of what's in that image. And when you get a large database of such image examples where you know the truth, the neural network is able to learn by example, that's called supervised learning. There's a lot of fascinating questions within that, which is, how do you provide the truth? When you given an image of a cat, how do you provide to the computer that this image contains a cat? Do you just say the entire image is a picture of a cat? Do you do what's very commonly been done, which is a bounding box, you have a very crude box around the cat's face saying, this is a cat? Do you do semantic segmentation? Mind you, this is a 2D image of a cat. So it's not, the computer knows nothing about our three-dimensional world, is just looking at a set of pixels. So, semantic segmentation is drawing a nice, very crisp outline around the cat and saying, that's a cat. That's really difficult to provide that truth. And one of the fundamental open questions in computer vision is, is that even a good representation of the truth? Now, there's another contrasting set of ideas that our attention they're overlapping is, well, it's used to be called unsupervised learning. What's commonly now called self-supervised learning. Which is trying to get less and less and less human supervision into the task. So self-supervised learning is more, it's been very successful in the domain of language model, natural English processing, and now more and more as being successful in computer vision task. And the idea there is, let the machine without any ground-truth annotation just look at pictures on the internet, or look at texts on the internet and try to learn something generalizable about the ideas that are at the core of language or at the core of vision. And based on that, we humans at its best like to call that common sense. So with this, we have this giant base of knowledge on top of which we build more sophisticated knowledge. We have this kind of commonsense knowledge. And so the idea with self-supervised learning is to build this commonsense knowledge about, what are the fundamental visual ideas that make up a cat and a dog and all those kinds of things without ever having human supervision? The dream there is the, you just let an AI system that's self supervised run around the internet for awhile, watch YouTube videos for millions and millions of hours, and without any supervision be primed and ready to actually learn with very few examples once the human is able to show up. We think of children in this way, human children, is your parents only give one or two examples to teach a concept. The dream with self-supervised learning is that will be the same with machines. That they would watch millions of hours of YouTube videos, and then come to a human and be able to understand when the human shows them, this is a cat. Like, remember this' a cat. They will understand that a cat is not just the thing with pointy ears, or a cat is a thing that's orange, or is furry, they'll see something more fundamental that we humans might not actually be able to introspect and understand. Like, if I asked you, what makes a cat versus a dog, you wouldn't probably not be able to answer that, but if I showed you, brought to you a cat and a dog, you'll be able to tell the difference. What are the ideas that your brain uses to make that difference? That's the whole dream with self-supervised learning, is it would be able to learn that on its own. That set of commonsense knowledge, that's able to tell the difference. And then there's like a lot of incredible uses of self-supervised learning, very weirdly called self-play mechanism. That's the mechanism behind the reinforcement learning successes of the systems that won at Go, at, AlphaZero that won a chess. - Oh, I see. That play games? - [Lex] That play games. - Got it. - So the idea of self-play is probably, applies to other domains than just games. Is a system that just plays against itself. And this is fascinating in all kinds of domains, but it knows nothing in the beginning. And the whole idea is it creates a bunch of mutations of itself and plays against those versions of itself. And the fascinating thing is when you play against systems that are a little bit better than you, you start to get better yourself. Like learning, that's how learning happens. That's true for martial arts. It's true in a lot of cases. Where you want to be interacting with systems that are just a little better than you. And then through this process of interacting with systems just a little better than you, you start following this process where everybody starts getting better and better and better and better until you are several orders of magnitude better than the world champion in chess, for example. And it's fascinating because it's like a runaway system. One of the most terrifying and exciting things that David Silver, the creator of AlphaGo and AlphaZero, one of the leaders of the team said, to me is a, they haven't found the ceiling for AlphaZero. Meaning it could just arbitrarily keep improving. Now, in the realm of chess, that doesn't matter to us. That it's like, it just ran away with the game of chess. Like it's like just so much better than humans. But the question is what, if you can create that in the realm that does have a bigger, deeper effect on human beings and societies, that can be a terrifying process. To me, it's an exciting process if you supervise it correctly, if you inject, if what's called value alignment, you make sure that the goals that the AI is optimizing is aligned with human beings and human societies. There's a lot of fascinating things to talk about within the specifics of neural networks and all the problems that people are working on. But I would say the really big, exciting one is self-supervised learning. We're trying to get less and less human supervision, less and less human supervision of neural networks. And also just a comment and I'll shut up. - No, please keep going. I'm learning. I have questions, but I'm learning. So please keep going. - So, to me what's exciting is not the theory, it's always the application. One of the most exciting applications of artificial intelligence, specifically neural networks and machine learning is Tesla Autopilot. So these are systems that are working in the real world. This isn't an academic exercise. This is human lives at stake. This is safety-critical. - These are automated vehicles. Autonomous vehicles. - Semi-autonomous. We want to be. - Okay. - We've gone through wars on these topics, - Semi-autonomous vehicles. - Semi-autonomous. So, even though it's called a FSD, Full Self-Driving, it is currently not fully autonomous, meaning human supervision is required. So, human is tasked with overseeing the systems. In fact, liability-wise, the human is always responsible. This is a human factor psychology question, which is fascinating. I'm fascinated by the whole space, which is a whole 'nother space of human robot interaction when AI systems and humans work together to accomplish tasks. That dance to me is one of the smaller communities, but I think it will be one of the most important open problems once they're solved, is how the humans and robots dance together. To me, semi-autonomous driving is one of those spaces. So for Elon, for example, he doesn't see it that way, he sees semi-autonomous driving as a stepping stone towards fully autonomous driving. Like, humans and robots can't dance well together. Like, humans and humans dance and robots and robots dance. Like, we need to, this is an engineering problem, we need to design a perfect robot that solves this problem. To me forever, maybe this is not the case with driving, but the world is going to be full of problems with always humans and robots have to interact, because I think robots will always be flawed, just like humans are going to be flawed, are flawed. And that's what makes life beautiful, that they're flawed. That's where learning happens at the edge of your capabilities. So you always have to figure out, how can flawed robots and flawed humans interact together such that they, like the sum is bigger than the whole, as opposed to focusing on just building the perfect robot? - Mm-hmm. - So that's one of the most exciting applications I would say of artificial intelligence to me is autonomous driving, the semi-autonomous driving. And that's a really good example of machine learning because those systems are constantly learning. And there's a process there that maybe I can comment on, the, Andrej Karpathy who's the head of autopilot calls it the data engine. And this process applies for a lot of machine learning, which is you build a system that's pretty good at doing stuff, you send it out into the real world, it starts doing the stuff and then it runs into what are called edge cases, like failure cases, where it screws up. We do this as kids. That you have- - You do this as adults. - We do this as adults. Exactly. But we learn really quickly. But the whole point, and this is the fascinating thing about driving, is you realize there's millions of edge cases. There's just like weird situations that you did not expect. And so the data engine process is you collect those edge cases, and then you go back to the drawing board and learn from them. And so you have to create this data pipeline where all these cars, hundreds of thousands of cars are driving around and something weird happens. And so whenever this weird detector fires, it's another important concept, that piece of data goes back to the mothership for the training, for the retraining of the system. And through this data engine process, it keeps improving and getting better and better and better and better. So basically you send out a pretty clever AI systems out into the world and let it find the edge cases, let it screw up just enough to figure out where the edge cases are, and then go back and learn from them, and then send out that new version and keep updating that version. - Is the updating done by humans? - The annotation is done by humans. The, so you have to, the weird examples come back, the edge cases, and you have to label what actually happened in there. There's also some mechanisms for automatically labeling, but mostly, I think you always have to rely on humans to improve, to understand what's happening in the weird cases. And then there's a lot of debate. And this, the other thing, what is artificial intelligence? Which is a bunch of smart people having very different opinions about what is intelligence. So AI is basically a community of people who don't agree on anything. - And it seems to be the case. First of all, this is a beautiful description of terms that I've heard many times among my colleagues at Stanford, at meetings in the outside world. And there are so many fascinating things. I have so many questions, but I do want to ask one question about the culture of AI, because it does seem to be a community where at least as an outsider, where it seems like there's very little consensus about what the terms and the operational definitions even mean. And there seems to be a lot of splitting happening now of not just supervised and unsupervised learning, but these sort of intermediate conditions where machines are autonomous, but then go back for more instruction like kids go home from college during the summer and get a little, moms still feeds them then eventually they leave the nest kind of thing. Is there something in particular about engineers, or about people in this realm of engineering that you think lends itself to disagreement? - Yeah, I think, so, first of all, the more specific you get, the less disagreement there is. So there's lot of disagreement about what is artificial intelligence, but there's less disagreement about what is machine learning and even less when you talk about active learning or machine teaching or self-supervised learning. And then when you get into like NLP language models or transformers, when you get into specific neural network architectures, there's less and less and less disagreement about those terms. So you might be hearing the disagreement from the high-level terms, and that has to do with the fact that engineering, especially when you're talking about intelligence systems is a little bit of an art and a science. So the art part is the thing that creates disagreements, because then you start having disagreements about how easy or difficult the particular problem is. For example, a lot of people disagree with Elon how difficult the problem of autonomous driving is. And so, but nobody knows. So there's a lot of disagreement about, what are the limits of these techniques? And through that, the terminology also contains within it the disagreements. But overall, I think it's also a young science that also has to do with that. So like it's not just engineering, it's that artificial intelligence truly is a large-scale discipline, where it's thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people working on it, huge amounts of money being made as a very recent thing. So we're trying to figure out those terms. And, of course, there's egos and personalities and a lot of fame to be made. Like the term deep learning, for example, neural networks have been around for many, many decades since the '60s, you can argue since the '40s. So there was a rebranding of neural networks into the word, deep learning, term, deep learning, that was part of the re-invigoration of the field, but it's really the same exact thing. - I didn't know that. I mean, I grew up in the age of neuroscience when neural networks were discussed, computational neuroscience and theoretical neuroscience, they had their own journals. It wasn't actually taken terribly seriously by experimentalists until a few years ago. I would say about five to seven years ago. Excellent theoretical neuroscientist like Larry Abbott and other colleagues, certainly at Stanford as well that people started paying attention to computational methods. But these terms, neural networks, computational methods, I actually didn't know that neural network works in deep learning where those have now become kind of synonymous. - No, they're always the same thing. - Interesting. It was, so. - I'm a neuroscientist and I didn't know that. - So, well, because neural networks probably means something else and neural science not something else, but a little different flavor depending on the field. And that's fascinating too, because neuroscience and AI people have started working together and dancing a lot more in the recent, I would say probably decade. - Oh, machines are going into the brain. I have a couple of questions, but one thing that I'm sort of fixated on that I find incredibly interesting is this example you gave of playing a game with a mutated version of yourself as a competitor. - Yeah. - I find that incredibly interesting as a kind of a parallel or a mirror for what happens when we try and learn as humans, which is we generate repetitions of whatever it is we're trying to learn, and we make errors. Occasionally we succeed. In a simple example, for instance, of trying to throw bulls eyes on a dartboard. - Yeah. - I'm going to have errors, errors, errors. I'll probably miss the dartboard. And maybe occasionally, hit a bullseye. And I don't know exactly what I just did, right? But then let's say I was playing darts against a version of myself where I was wearing a visual prism, like my visual, I had a visual defect, you learn certain things in that mode as well. You're saying that a machine can sort of mutate itself, does the mutation always cause a deficiency that it needs to overcome? Because of mutations in biology sometimes give us super powers, right? Occasionally, you'll get somebody who has better than 2020 vision, and they can see better than 99.9% of people out there. So, when you talk about a machine playing a game against a mutated version of itself, is the mutation always say what we call a negative mutation, or an adaptive or a maladaptive mutation? - No, you don't know until you get, so, you mutate first and then figure out and they compete against each other. - So, you're evolving, the machine gets to evolve itself in real time. - Yeah. And I think of it, which would be exciting if you could actually do with humans. It's not just. So, usually you freeze a version of the system. So, really you take on Andrew of yesterday and you make 10 clones of them. And then maybe you mutate, maybe not. And then you do a bunch of competitions of the Andrew of today, like you fight to the death, and who wins last. So, I love that idea of like creating a bunch of clones of myself from like from each of the day for the past year, and just seeing who's going to be better at like podcasting or science, or picking up chicks at a bar or I don't know, or competing in Jujitsu. That's the one way to do it, I mean, a lot of Lexes would have to die for that process, but that's essentially what happens, is in reinforcement learning through the self-play mechanisms, it's a graveyard of systems that didn't do that well. And the surviving, the good ones survive. - Do you think that, I mean, Darwin's Theory of Evolution might have worked in some sense in this way, but at the population level. I mean, you get a bunch of birds with different shaped beaks and some birds have the shaped beak that allows them to get the seeds. I mean, is a trivially simple example of Darwinian in evolution, but I think it's correct even though it's not exhaustive. Is what you're referring to? You essentially that normally this is done between members of a different species, lots of different members of species have different traits and some get selected for, but you could actually create multiple versions of yourself with different traits. - So, with, I should probably have said this, but perhaps it's implied with machine learning, with reinforcement learning through these processes. One of the big requirements, is to have an objective function, a loss function, a utility function, those are all different terms for the same thing, is there's a like any equation that says what's good, and then you're trying to optimize that equation. So, there's a clear goal for these systems. - Because it's a game, like with chess, there's a goal. - But for anything. Anything you want machine learning to solve, there needs to be an objective function. In machine learning, it's usually called Loss Function, that you're optimizing. The interesting thing about evolution, it's complicated of course, but the goal also seems to be evolving. Like it's a, I guess, adaptation to the environment, is the goal, but it's unclear that you can convert that always. It's like survival of the fittest. It's unclear what the fittest is. In machine learning, the starting point, and this is like what human ingenuity provides, is that fitness function of what's good and what's bad, which it lets you know which of the systems is going to win. So, you need to have a equation like that. One of the fascinating things about humans, is we figure out objective functions for ourselves. Like it's the meaning of life, like why the hell are we here? And a machine currently has to have a hard-coded statement about why. - It has to have a meaning of- - Yeah. - Artificial intelligence-based life. - Right. It can't. So, like there's a lot of interesting explorations about that function being more about curiosity, about learning new things and all that kind of stuff, but it's still hard coded. If you want a machine to be able to be good at stuff, it has to be given very clear statements of what good at stuff means. That's one of the challenges of artificial intelligence, is you have to formalize the, in order to solve a problem, you have to formalize it and you have to provide both like the full sensory information, you have to be very clear about what is the data that's being collected, and you have to also be clear about the objective function. What is the goal that you're trying to reach? And that's a very difficult thing for artificial intelligence. - I love that you mentioned curiosity, I am sure this definition falls short in many ways, but I define curiosity as a strong interest in knowing something, but without an attachment to the outcome. It's sort of a, it could be a random search, but there's not really an emotional attachment, it's really just a desire to discover and unveil what's there without hoping it's a gold coin under a rock, you're just looking under rocks. Is that more or less how the, within machine learning, it sounds like there are elements of reward prediction and rewards. The machine has to know when it's done the right thing. So, can you make machines that are curious, or are the sorts of machines that you are describing, curious by design? - Yeah, curiosity is a kind of a symptom, not the goal. So, what happens, is one of the big trade-offs in reinforcement learning, is this exploration versus exploitation. So, when you know very little, it pays off to explore a lot, even suboptimal, like even trajectories that seem like they're not going to lead anywhere, that's called exploration. The smarter and smarter and smarter you get, the more emphasis you put on exploitation, meaning you take the best solution, you take the best path. Now, through that process, the exploration can look like curiosity by us humans, but it's really just trying to get out of the local optimal, the thing it's already discovered. From an AI perspective, it's always looking to optimize the objective function, it derives, and we can talk about the slot more, but in terms of the tools of machine learning today, it derives no pleasure from just the curiosity of like, I don't know, discovery. - So, there's no dopamine for machine learning. - There's no dopamine. - There's no reward, system chemical, or I guess electronic-reward system. - That said, if you look at machine learning literature and reinforcement learning literature, that will use, like deep mind, we use terms like dopamine, we're constantly trying to use the human brain to inspire totally new solutions to these problems. So, they'll think like, how does dopamine function in the human brain, and how can it lead to more interesting ways to discover optimal solutions? But ultimately currently, there has to be a formal objective function. Now, you could argue the humans also has a set of objective functions we try and optimize, we're just not able to introspect them. - Yeah, we don't actually know what we're looking for and seeking and doing. - Well, like Lisa Feldman Barrett who we spoken with at least on Instagram, I hope you- - I met her through you, yeah. - Yeah, I hope you actually have are on this podcast. - Yes, she's terrific. - So, she has a very, it has to do with homeostasis like that. Basically, there's a very dumb objective function that the brain is trying to optimize, like to keep like body temperature the same. Like there's a very dom kind of optimization function happening. And then what we humans do with our fancy consciousness and cognitive abilities, is we tell stories to ourselves so we can have nice podcasts, but really it's the brain trying to maintain a, just like healthy state, I guess. That's fascinating. I also see the human brain, and I hope artificial intelligence systems, as not just systems that solve problems, or optimize a goal, but are also storytellers. I think there's a power to telling stories. We tell stories to each other, that's what communication is. Like when you're alone, that's when you solve problems, that's when it makes sense to talk about solving problems. But when you're a community, the capability to communicate, tell stories, share ideas in such a way that those ideas are stable over a long period of time, that's like, that's being a charismatic storyteller. And I think both humans are very good at this. Arguably, I would argue that's why we are who we are, is we're great storytellers. And then AI I hope will also become that. So, it's not just about being able to solve problems with a clear objective function, it's afterwards, be able to tell like a way better, like make up a way better story about why you did something, or why you failed. - So, you think that robots or, and/or machines of some sort are going to start telling human stories? - Well, definitely. So, the technical field for that is called Explainable AI, Explainable Artificial Intelligence, is trying to figure out how you get the AI system to explain to us humans why the hell it failed, or why it succeeded, or there's a lot of different sort of versions of this, or to visualize how it understands the world. That's a really difficult problem, especially with neural networks that are famously opaque, that we don't understand in many cases, why a particular neural network does what it does so well, and to try to figure out where it's going to fail, that requires the AI to explain itself. There's a huge amount of money, like there's a huge amount of money in this, especially from government funding and so on. Because if you want to deploy AI systems in the real world, we humans at least, want to ask it a question like, why the hell did you do that? Like in a dark way, why did you just kill that person, right? Like if a car ran over a person, we want to understand why that happened. And now again, we're sometimes very unfair to AI systems because we humans can often not explain why very well. But that's the field of Explainable AI that people are very interested in because the more and more we rely on AI systems, like the Twitter recommender system, that AI algorithm that's, I would say impacting elections, perhaps starting wars, or at least military conflict, that algorithm, we want to ask that algorithm, first of all, do you know what the hell you're doing? Do you understand the society-level effects you're having? And can you explain the possible other trajectories? Like we would have that kind of conversation with a human, we want to be able to do that with an AI. And in my own personal level, I think it would be nice to talk to AI systems for stupid stuff, like robots when they fail to- - Why'd you fall down the stairs? - Yeah. But not an engineering question, but almost like an endearing question, like I'm looking for, if I fell and you and I were hanging out, I don't think you need an explanation exactly what were the dynamics, like what was the under actuated system problem here? Like what was the texture of the floor? Or so on. Or like, what was the- - No, I want to know what you're thinking. - That, or you might joke about like, you're drunk again, go home, or something, like there could be humor in it, that's an opportunity. Like storytelling, isn't just explanation of what happened, it's something that makes people laugh, it makes people fall in love, it makes people dream, and understand things in a way that poetry makes people understand things as opposed to a rigorous log of where every sensor was, where every actuator was. - I mean, I find this incredible because one of the hallmarks of severe autism spectrum disorders is, a report of experience from the autistic person that is very much a catalog of action steps. It's like, how do you feel today? And they'll say, well, I got up and I did this, and then I did this, and I did this. And it's not at all the way that a person who doesn't have autism spectrum disorder would respond. And the way you describe these machines has so much humanism, or so much of a human and biological element, but I realized that we were talking about machines. I want to make sure that I understand if there's a distinction between a machine that learns, a machine with artificial intelligence and a robot. Like at what point does a machine become a robot? So, if I have a ballpoint pen, I'm assuming I wouldn't call that a robot, but if my ballpoint pen can come to me when I moved to the opposite side of the table, if it moves by whatever mechanism, at that point, does it become a robot? - Okay, there's 1 million ways to explore this question. It's a fascinating one. So, first of all, there's a question of what is life? Like how do you know something as a living form and not? And it's to the question of when does sort of a, maybe a cold computational system becomes a, or already loading these words with a lot of meaning, robot and machine, So, one, I think movement is important, but that's a kind of a boring idea that a robot is just a machine that's able to act in the world. So, one artificial intelligence could be both just the thinking thing, which I think is what machine learning is, and also the acting thing, which is what we usually think about robots. So, robots are the things that have a perception system that's able to take in the world however you define the world, is able to think and learn and do whatever the hell it does inside, and then act on the world. So, that's the difference between maybe an AI system learning machine and a robot, it's something that's able, a robot is something that's able to perceive the world and act in the world. - So, it could be through language or sound, or it could be through movement or both. - Yeah. And I think it could also be in the digital space as long as there's a aspect of entity that's inside the machine and a world that's outside the machine. And there's a sense in which the machine is sensing that world and acting in it. - So, we could, for instance, there could be a version of a robot, according to the definition that I think you're providing, where the robot, where I go to sleep at night and this robot goes and forges for information that it thinks I want to see loaded onto my desktop in the morning. There was no movement of that machine, there was no language, but it essentially, has movement in cyberspace. - Yeah, there's a distinction that I think is important in that there's an element of it being an entity, whether it's in the digital or the physical space. So, when you have something like Alexa in your home, most of the speech recognition, most of what Alexa is doing, is constantly being sent back to the mothership. When Alexa is there on its own, that's to me, a robot, when it's there interacting with the world. When it's simply a finger of the main mothership, then the Alexa is not a robot, then it's just an interaction device, then may be the main Amazon Alexa AI, big, big system is the robot. So, that's important because there's some element, to us humans, I think, where we want there to be an entity, whether in the digital or the physical space, that's where ideas of consciousness come in and all those kinds of things that we project our understanding of what it means to be a being. And so, to take that further, when does a machine become a robot, I think there's a special moment. There's a special moment in a person's life and in a robot's life where it surprises you. I think surprise is a really powerful thing, where you know how the thing works and yet it surprises you, that's a magical moment for us humans. So, whether it's a chess-playing program that does something that you haven't seen before, that makes people smile like, huh, those moments happen with AlphaZero for the first time in chess playing, where grand masters were really surprised by a move. They didn't understand the move and then they studied and studied and then they understood it. But that moment of surprise, that's for grandmasters in chess. I find that moment of surprise really powerful, really magical in just everyday life. - Because it supersedes the human brain in that moment? - So, it's not supersedes, like outperforms, but surprises you in a positive sense. Like I didn't think he could do that, I didn't think that you had that in you. And I think that moment is a big transition for a robot from a moment of being a servant that accomplishes a particular task with some level of accuracy, with some rate of failure, to an entity, a being that's struggling just like you are in this world. And that's a really important moment that I think you're not going to find many people in the AI community that talk like I just did. I'm not speaking like some philosopher or some hippie, I'm speaking from purely engineering perspective. I think it's really important for robots to become entities and explore that as a real engineering problem, as opposed to everybody treats robots in the robotics community, they don't even call them or he or she, they don't give them, try to avoid giving them names, they've really want to see like a system, like a servant. They see it as a servant that's trying to accomplish a task. To me, and don't think I'm just romanticizing the notion, I think it's a being, it's a currently perhaps a dumb being, but in the long arc of history, humans are pretty dumb beings too, so- - I would agree with that statement. [Andrew laughing] - So, I tend to really want to explore this treating robots really as entities, yeah. So, like anthropomorphization, which is the sort of the act of looking at a inanimate object and projecting onto it life-like features, I think robotics generally sees that as a negative, I see it as a superpower. Like that, we need to use that. - Well, I'm struck by how that really grabs onto the relationship between human and machine, or human and robot. So, I guess the simple question is, and I think you've already told us the answer, but does interacting with a robot change you? In other words, do we develop relationships to robots? - Yeah, I definitely think so. I think the moment you see a robot or AI systems as more than just servants but entities, they begin to change you, in just like good friends do, just like relationships just to other humans. I think for that, you have to have certain aspects of that interaction. Like the robot's ability to say no, to have its own sense of identity, to have its own set of goals, that's not constantly serving you, but instead, trying to understand the world and do that dance of understanding through communication with you. So, I definitely think there's a, I mean, I have a lot of thoughts about this as you may know, and that's at the core of my life-long dream actually of what I want to do, which is I believe that most people have a notion of loneliness in them that we haven't discovered, that we haven't explored, I should say. And I see AI systems as helping us explore that so that we can become better humans, better people towards each other. So, I think that connection between human and AI, human and robot, is not only possible, but will help us understand ourselves in ways that are like several orders of magnitude deeper than we ever could have imagined. I tend to believe that [sighing] well, I have very wild levels of belief in terms of how impactful that will be, right? - So, when I think about human relationships, I don't always break them down into variables, but we could explore a few of those variables and see how they map to human-robot relationships. One is just time, right? If you spend zero time with another person at all in cyberspace or on the phone or in person, you essentially have no relationship to them. If you spend a lot of time, you have a relationship, this is obvious. But I guess one variable would be time, how much time you spend with the other entity, robot or human. The other would be wins and successes. You enjoy successes together. I'll give a absolutely trivial example this in a moment, but the other would be failures. When you struggle with somebody, whether or not you struggle between one another, you disagree, like I was really struck by the fact that you said that robot saying no, I've never thought about a robot saying no to me, but there it is. - I look forward to you being one of the first people I send this robots to. - So do I. So, there's struggle. When you struggle with somebody, you grow closer. Sometimes the struggles are imposed between those two people, so called trauma bonding, they call it in the whole psychology literature and pop psychology literature. But in any case, I can imagine. So, time successes together, struggle together, and then just peaceful time, hanging out at home, watching movies, waking up near one another, here, we're breaking down the elements of relationships of any kind. So, do you think that these elements apply to robot-human relationships? And if so, then I could see how, if the robot has its own entity and has some autonomy in terms of how it reacts you, it's not just there just to serve you, it's not just a servant, it actually has opinions, and can tell you when maybe your thinking is flawed, or your actions are flawed. - It can also leave. - It could also leave. So, I've never conceptualized robot-human interactions this way. So, tell me more about how this might look. Are we thinking about a human-appearing robot? I know you and I have both had intense relationships to our, we have separate dogs obviously, but to animals, it sounds a lot like human-animal interaction. So, what is the ideal human-robot relationship? - So, there's a lot to be said here, but you actually pinpointed one of the big, big first steps, which is this idea of time. And it's a huge limitation in machine-learning community currently. Now we're back to like the actual details. Life-long learning is a problem space that focuses on how AI systems can learn over a long period of time. What's currently most machine learning systems are not able to do, is to all of the things you've listed under time, the successes, the failures, or just chilling together watching movies, AI systems are not able to do that, which is all the beautiful, magical moments that I believe are the days filled with, they're not able to keep track of those together with you. - 'Cause they can't move with you and be with you. - No, no, like literally we don't have the techniques to do the learning, the actual learning of containing those moments. Current machine-learning systems are really focused on understanding the world in the following way, it's more like the perception system, like looking around, understand like what's in the scene. That there's a bunch of people sitting down, that there is cameras and microphones, that there's a table, understand that. But the fact that we shared this moment of talking today, and still remember that for like next time you're doing something, remember that this moment happened. We don't know how to do that technique-wise. This is what I'm hoping to innovate on as I think it's a very, very important component of what it means to create a deeper relationship, that sharing of moments together. - Could you post a photo of you in the robot, like selfie with robot and the robot sees that image and recognizes that was time spent, there were smiles, or there were tears- - Yeah. - And create some sort of metric of emotional depth in the relationship and update its behavior? - So. - Could it... It texts you in the middle of the night and say, why haven't you texted me back? - Well, yes, all of those things, but we can dig into that. But I think that time element, forget everything else, just sharing moments together, that changes everything. I believe that changes everything. Now, there's specific things that are more in terms of systems that I can explain you. It's more technical and probably a little bit offline, 'cause I have kind of wild ideas how that can revolutionize social networks and operating systems. But the point is that element alone, forget all the other things we're talking about like emotions, saying no, all that, just remembering sharing moments together would change everything. We don't currently have systems that share moments together. Like even just you and your fridge, just all those times, you went late at night and ate thing you shouldn't have eaten, that was a secret moment you have with your refrigerator. You shared that moment, that darkness or that beautiful moment where you were just like heartbroken for some reason, you're eating that ice cream or whatever, that's a special moment. And that refrigerator was there for you, and the fact that it missed the opportunity to remember that is tragic. And once it does remember that, I think you're going to be very attached to the refrigerator. You're going to go through some hell with that refrigerator. Most of us have, like in the developed world, have weird relationships with food, right? So, you can go through some deep moments of trauma and triumph with food, and at the core of that, is the refrigerator. So, a smart refrigerator, I believe would change society. Not just the refrigerator, but these ideas in the systems all around us. So, I just want to comment on how powerful that idea of time is. And then there's a bunch of elements of actual interaction of allowing you as a human to feel like you're being heard. Truly heard, truly understood, that we human, like deep friendship is like that, I think, but there's still an element of selfishness, there's still an element of not really being able to understand another human. And a lot of the times when you're going through trauma together, through difficult times and through successes, you actually starting to get that inkling of understanding of each other, but I think that could be done more aggressively, more efficiently. Like if you think of a great therapist, I think I've never actually been to a therapist, but I'm a believer I used to want to be a psychiatrist. - Do Russians go to therapists? - No, they don't. They don't. And if they do, the therapist don't live to tell the story. I do believe in talk therapy, which friendship is to me, is it's talk therapy, or like you don't even necessarily need to talk [laughing] it's like just connecting through in the space of ideas and the space of experiences. And I think there's a lot of ideas of how to make AI systems to be able to ask the right questions and truly hear another human. This is what we try to do with podcasting, right? I think there's ways to do that with AI. But above all else, just remembering the collection of moments that make up the day, the week, the months, I think you maybe have some of this as well. Some of my closest friends still are the friends from high school. That's time, we've been through a bunch of together, and that like we're very different people. But just the fact that we've been through that, and we remember those moments, and those moments somehow create a depth of connection like nothing else, like you and your refrigerator. - I love that because my graduate advisor, she unfortunately, she passed away, but when she passed away, somebody said at her at her memorial all these amazing things she had done, et cetera. And then her kids got up there, and she had young children and that I knew as when she was pregnant with them. And so, it was really, you're even now I can feel like your heart gets heavy, thinking about this, they're going to grow up without their mother. And it was really amazing, very strong young girls, and now the young women. And what they said was incredible, they said what they really appreciated most about their mother, who was an amazing person, is all the unstructured time they spent together. - Mm-hmm. - So, it wasn't the trips to the zoo, it wasn't she woke up at five in the morning and drove us to school. She did all those things too. She had two hour commute in each direction, it was incredible, ran a lab, et cetera, but it was the unstructured time. So, on the passing of their mother, that's what they remembered was that the biggest give and what bonded them to her, was all the time where they just kind of hung out. And the way you describe the relationship to a refrigerator is so, I want to say human-like, but I'm almost reluctant to say that. Because what I'm realizing as we're talking, is that what we think of as human-like might actually be the lower form of relationship. There may be relationships that are far better than the sorts of relationships that we can conceive in our minds right now based on what these machine relationship interactions could teach us. Do I have that right? - Yeah, I think so. I think there's no reason to see machines as somehow incapable of teaching us something that's deeply human. I don't think humans have a monopoly on that. I think we understand ourselves very poorly and we need to have the kind of prompting from a machine. And definitely part of that, is just remembering the moments. I think the unstructured time together, I wonder if it's quite so unstructured. That's like calling this podcast on structured time. - Maybe what they meant, was it wasn't a big outing, there was no specific goal, but a goal was created through the lack of a goal. Like we would just hang out and then you start playing, thumb war, and you end up playing thumb war for an hour. So, it's the structure emerges from lack of structure. - No, but the thing is the moments, there's something about those times that creates special moments, and I think those could be optimized for. I think we think of like a big outing as, I don't know, going to Six Flags or something, or some big, the Grand Canyon, or go into some, I don't know, I think we would need to, we don't quite yet understand, as humans, what creates magical moments. I think it's possible to optimize a lot of those things. And perhaps like podcasting is helping people discover that, like maybe the thing we want to optimize for isn't necessarily like some sexy, like quick clips, maybe what we want, is long-form authenticity. - Depth. - Depth. So, we were trying to figure that out, certainly from a deep connection between humans and humans and NAS systems, I think long conversations, or long periods of communication over a series of moments like my new, perhaps, seemingly insignificant to the big ones, the big successes, the big failures, those are all just stitching those together and talking throughout. I think that's the formula for a really, really deep connection. That from like a very specific engineering perspective, is I think a fascinating open problem that has been really worked on very much. And for me, from a, if I have the guts and, I mean there's a lot of things to say, but one of it is guts, is I'll build a startup around it. - So, let's talk about this startup and let's talk about the dream. You mentioned this dream before in our previous conversations, always as little hints dropped here and there. Just for anyone listening, there's never been an offline conversation about this dream, I'm not privy to anything, except what Lex says now. And I realized that there's no way to capture the full essence of a dream in any kind of verbal statement in a way that captures all of it. But what is this dream that you've referred to now several times when we've sat down together and talked on the phone? Maybe it's this company, maybe it's something distinct. If you feel comfortable, it'd be great if you could share a little bit about what that is. - Sure. So, the way people express long-term vision, I've noticed is quite different. Like Elon is an example of somebody who can very crisply say exactly what the goal is. Also has to do with the fact that problems he's solving have nothing to do with humans. So, my long-term vision is a little bit more difficult to express in words, I've noticed, as I've tried, it could be my brain's failure, but there's a way to sneak up to it. So, let me just say a few things. Early on in life and also in the recent years, I've interacted with a few robots where I understood there's magic there. And that magic could be shared by millions if it's brought to light. When I first met Spot from Boston Dynamics, I realized there's magic there that nobody else is seeing. - Is the dog. - The dog, sorry. The Spot is the four-legged robot from Boston Dynamics. Some people might have seen it, it's this yellow dog. And sometimes in life, you just notice something that just grabs you. And I believe that this is something that this magic is something that could be in every single device in the world. The way that I think maybe Steve Jobs thought about the personal computer, laws didn't think about the personal computer this way, but Steve did. Which is like, he thought that the personal computer should be as thin as a sheet of paper and everybody should have one, and this idea, I think it is heartbreaking that we're getting, the world is being filled up with machines that are soulless. And I think every one of them can have that same magic. One of the things that also inspired me in terms of a startup, is that magic can engineered much easier than I thought. That's my intuition with everything I've ever built and worked on. So, the dream is to add a bit of that magic in every single computing system in the world. So, the way that Windows Operating System for a long time was the primary operating system everybody interacted with, they built apps on top of it. I think this is something that should be as a layer, it's almost as an operating system in every device that humans interacted with in the world. Now, what that actually looks like, the actual dream when I was officially a kid, it didn't have this concrete form of a business, it had more of a dream of exploring your own loneliness by interacting with machines, robots. This deep connection between humans and robots was always a dream. And so, for me, I'd love to see a world where there's every home as a robot, and not a robot that washes the dishes, or a sex robot, or I don't know, think of any kind of activity the robot can do, but more like a companion. - A family member. - A family member, the way a dog is. - Mm-hmm. - But a dog that's able to speak your language too. So, not just connect the way a dog does by looking at you and looking away and almost like smiling with its soul in that kind of way, but also to actually understand what the hell, like, why are you so excited about the successes? Like understand the details, understand the traumas. And that, I just think [sighing] that has always filled me with excitement that I could, with artificial intelligence, bring joy to a lot of people. More recently, I've been more and more heartbroken to see the kind of division, derision, even hate that's boiling up on the internet through social networks. And I thought this kind of mechanism is exactly applicable in the context of social networks as well. So, it's an operating system that serves as your guide on the internet. One of the biggest problems with YouTube and social networks currently, is they're optimizing for engagement. I think if you create AI systems that know each individual person, you're able to optimize for long-term growth for a long-term happiness. - Of the individual, or- - Of the individual, of the individual. And there's a lot of other things to say, which is in order for AI systems to learn everything about you, they need to collect, they need to just like you and I when we talk offline, we're collecting data about each others secrets about each other, the same way AI has to do that. And that allows you to, and that requires you to rethink ideas of ownership of data. I think each individual should own all of their data and very easily be able to leave just like AI systems can leave, humans can disappear and delete all of their data in a moment's notice. Which is actually better than we humans can do, is once we load the data into each other, it's there. I think it's very important to be both, give people complete control over their data in order to establish trust that they can trust you. And the second part of trust is transparency. Whenever the data is used to make it very clear what is being used for. And not clear in a lawyerly legal sense, but clear in a way that people really understand what it's used for. I believe when people have the ability to delete all their data and walk away and know how the data is being used, I think they'll stay. - The possibility of a clean breakup, is actually what will keep people together. - Yeah, I think so. I think, exactly. I think a happy marriage acquires the ability to divorce easily without the divorce industrial complex or whatever. Things currently going on and then there's so much money to be made from lawyers and divorce. But yeah, the ability to leave is what enables love, I think. - It's interesting. I've heard the phrase from a semi-cynical friend, that marriage is the leading cause of divorce, but now we've heard that divorce, or the possibility of divorce could be the leading cause of marriage. - Of a happy marriage. - Good point. - Of a happy marriage. So, yeah. So, there's a lot of details there, but the big dream is that connection between AI system and a human. And I haven't. There's so much fear about artificial intelligence systems and about robots that I haven't quite found the right words to express that vision because the vision I have, it's not like some naive, delusional vision of like technology is going to save everybody, it's I really do just have a positive view of ways AI systems can help humans explore themselves. - I love that positivity and I agree that the stance everything is doomed is equally bad to say that everything's going to turn out all right, there has to be a dedicated effort. And clearly, you're thinking about what that dedicated effort would look like. You mentioned two aspects to this dream [clears throat] and I want to make sure that I understand where they connect if they do, or if they are independent streams. One was this hypothetical robot family member, or some other form of robot that would allow people to experience the kind of delight that you experienced many times, and that you would like the world to be able to have, and it's such a beautiful idea of this give. And the other is social media or social network platforms that really serve individuals and their best selves and their happiness and their growth. Is there crossover between those, or are these two parallel dreams? - It's 100% of the same thing. It's difficult to kind of explain without going through details, but maybe one easy way to explain the way I think about social networks, is to create an AI system that's yours. It's not like Amazon Alexa that's centralized, you own the data, it's like your little friend that becomes your representative on Twitter that helps you find things that will make you feel good, that will also challenge your thinking to make you grow, but not get to that, not let you get lost in the negative spiral of dopamine, that gets you to be angry, or most just get you to be not open to learning. And so, that little representative is optimizing your long-term health. And I believe that that is not only good for human beings, it's also good for business. I think longterm, you can make a lot of money by challenging this idea that the only way to make money, is maximizing engagement. And one of the things that people disagree with me on, is they think Twitter's always going to win. Like maximizing engagement is always going to win, I don't think so. I think people have woken up now to understanding that, like they don't always feel good, the ones who are on Twitter a lot, that they don't always feel good at the end of the week. - I would love feedback from whatever this creature, whatever, I don't know what to call it, as to maybe at the end of the week, it would automatically unfollow some of the people that I follow because it realized through some really smart data about how I was feeling inside, or how I was sleeping, or something that, I don't know, that just wasn't good for me. But it might also put things and people in front of me that I ought to see, is that kind of a sliver of what this look like? - The whole point, because of the interaction, because of sharing the moments and learning a lot about you, you're now able to understand what interactions led you to become a better version of yourself. Like the person you yourself are happy with. This isn't, if you're into flat earth and you feel very good about it, that you believe that earth is flat, like the idea that you should sensor that is ridiculous. If it makes you feel good and you becoming the best version of yourself, I think you should be getting as much flat earth as possible. Now, it's also good to challenge your ideas, but not because the centralized committee decided, but because you tell to the system that you like challenging your ideas, I think all of us do. And then, which actually YouTube doesn't do that well, once you go down the flat-earth rabbit hole, that's all you're going to see. It's nice to get some really powerful communicators to argue against flat earth. And it's nice to see that for you, and potentially, at least long-term to expand your horizons, maybe the earth is not flat. But if you continue to live your whole life thinking the earth is flat, I think, and you're being a good father or son or daughter, and like you're being the best version of yourself and you're happy with yourself, I think the earth is flat. So, like I think this kind of idea, and I'm just using that kind of silly, ridiculous example because I don't like the idea of centralized forces controlling what you can and can't see, but I also don't like this idea of like not censoring anything. Because that's always the biggest problem with that, is this there's a central decider, I think you yourself can decide what you want to see and not, and it's good to have a companion that reminds you that you felt last time you did this, or you felt good last time you did this. - Man, I feel like in every good story, there's a guide or a companion that flies out, or forges a little bit further, a little bit differently and brings back information that helps us, or at least tries to steer us in the right direction. - So, yeah, that's exactly what I'm thinking and what I've been working on. I should mention as a bunch of difficulties here, you see me up and down a little bit recently. So, there's technically a lot of challenges here. Just like with a lot of technologies, and the reason I'm talking about it on a podcast comfortably as opposed to working in secret, is it's really hard and maybe it's time has not come. And that's something you have to constantly struggle with in terms of like entrepreneurially as a startup, like I've also mentioned to you, maybe offline, I really don't care about money, I don't care about business success, all those kinds of things. So, it's a difficult decision to make, how much of your time do you want to go all in here and give everything to this? It's a big roll the dice. Because I've also realized that's working on some of these problems, both with the robotics and the technical side in terms of the machine-learning system that I'm describing, it's lonely, it's really lonely. Because both on a personal level and a technical level. So, on the technical level, I'm surrounded by people that kind of doubt me, which I think all entrepreneurs go through. And they doubt you in the following sense, they know how difficult it is. Like the people that the colleagues of mine, they know how difficult life-long learning is, they also know how difficult it is to build a system like this, to build the competitive social network. And in general, there's a kind of a loneliness to just working on something on your own for long periods of time. And you start to doubt whether, given that you don't have a track record of success, like that's a big one. But when you look in the mirror, especially when you're young, but I still have that, I'm most things, you look in the mirror, it's like, and you have these big dreams, how do you know you're actually as smart as you think you are? Like how do you know you're going to be able to accomplish this dream? You have this ambition. - You sort of don't, but you're kind of pulling on a string hoping that there's a bigger ball of yarn. - Yeah. [Andrew laughing] But you have this kind of intuition. I think I pride myself in knowing what I'm good at, because the reason I have that intuition, is 'cause I think I'm very good at knowing all the things I suck at, which is basically everything. So, like whenever I notice like, wait a minute, I'm kind of good at this, which is very rare for me. I think like that, that might be a ball of yarn worth pulling at. And the thing with in terms of engineering systems that are able to interact with humans, I think I'm very good at that. And because we talk about podcasting and so on, I don't know if I'm very good at podcasts. - You're very good at podcasting, right? - But I certainly don't, I think maybe it is compelling for people to watch a kindhearted idiot struggle with this form, maybe that's what's compelling. But in terms of like actual being a good engineer of human-robot interaction systems, I think I'm good. But it's hard to know until you do it, and then the world keeps telling you you're not, and it's full of doll, it's really hard. And I've been struggling with that recently, it's kind of a fascinating struggle. But then that's where the Goggins thing comes in, is like, aside from the state-hard motherfucker, is the, like whenever you're struggling, that's a good sign that if you keep going, that you're going to be alone in the success, right? - Well, in your case, however, I agree. And actually David had a post recently that I thought was among his many brilliant posts, was one of the more brilliant about how he talked about this myth of the light at the end of the tunnel. And instead, what he replaced that myth with, was a concept that eventually, your eyes adapt to the dark. That the tunnel, it's not about a light at the end, that it's really about adapting to the dark of the tunnel. It's very Goggins- - I love him so much. - Yeah. You got share a lot in common knowing you both a bit, share a lot in common. But in this loneliness and the pursuit of this dream, it seems to me, it has a certain component to it that is extremely valuable, which is that the loneliness itself could serve as a driver to build the companion for the journey. - Well, I'm very deeply aware of that. So, like some people can make, 'cause I talk about love a lot, I really love everything in this world, but I also love humans, friendship and romantic, like even the cheesy stuff, just- - You like romantic movies? - Yeah, not those, not necessarily. So, well, I got so much from Rogan about like, was it the Tango scene from \\\"Scent of a Woman,\\\" but I find like there's nothing better than a woman in a red dress, just like the classy- - You should move to Argentina my friend. My father's Argentine, and you know what he said when I went on your podcast for the first time? He said, he dresses well. Because in Argentina, the men go to a wedding or a party or something, in the U.S., by halfway through the night, 10 minutes in the night, all the jackets are off. - Yeah. - It looks like everyone's undressing for the party they just got dressed up for. And he said, you know, I liked the way he dresses. And then when I started, he was talking about you. And then when I started my podcast, he said, why don't you wear a real suit like your friend Lex? [laughing] - I remember that. - No, you can't. But let's talk about this pursuit just a bit more, because I think what you're talking about, is building a, not just a solution for loneliness, but you've alluded to the loneliness as itself, an important thing. And I think you're right. I think within people, there is like caverns of faults and shame, but also just the desire to have resonance, to be seen and heard. And I don't even know that it's seen and heard through language. But these reservoirs of loneliness, I think, well, they're interesting, maybe you could comment a little bit about it. Because just as often as you talk about love, I haven't quantified it, but it seems that you talk about this loneliness, and maybe you just if you're willing, you'll share a little bit more about that, and what that feels like now in the pursuit of building this robot-human relationship. And you've been, let me be direct, you've been spending a lot of time on building a robot-human relationship, where's that at? - Oh, in terms of business, in terms of systems? - No, I'm talking about a specific robot. - Oh [laughing] so, okay, I should mention a few things. So, one, is there's a startup with an idea where I hope millions of people can use. And then there's my own personal like almost like Frankenstein explorations with particular robots. So, I'm very fascinated with the legged robots in my own, private sounds like dark, but like in of one experiments to see if I can recreate the magic. And that's been, I have a lot of really good already perception systems and control systems that are able to communicate affection in a dog-like fashion. So, I'm in a really good place there. The stumbling blocks, which also have been part of my sadness recently, is that I also have to work with robotics companies that I gave so much of my heart, soul and love and appreciation towards Boston Dynamics, but Boston Dynamics has also, as a company, it has to make a lot of money and they have marketing teams. And they're like looking at this silly Russian kid in a suit and tie, it's like, what's he trying to do with all this love and robot interaction and dancing and so on? So, there was a, I think let's say for now, it's like, when you break up with a girlfriend or something, right now, we decided to part ways on this particular thing. They're huge supporters of mine, they're huge fans, but on this particular thing, Boston Dynamics is not focusing on, or interested in human-robot interaction. In fact, their whole business currently, is keep the robot as far away from humans as possible because it's an in the industrial setting where it's doing monitoring in dangerous environments. It's almost like a remote security camera, essentially is its application. To me, I thought it's still, even in those applications, exceptionally useful for the robot to be able to perceive humans, like see humans and to be able to, in a big map, localize where those humans are and have human intention. For example, like this, I did this a lot of work with pedestrians, for a robot to be able to anticipate what the how the human is doing, like where it's walking. The humans are not ballistics object, just because you're walking this way one moment, it doesn't mean you'll keep walking that direction, you have to infer a lot of signals, especially with the head movement and the eye movement. And so, I thought that's super interesting to explore, but they didn't feel that. So, I'll be working with a few other robotics companies that are much more open to that kind of stuff, and they're super excited and fans of mine. And hopefully, Boston Dynamics, my first love, like getting back with an ex-girlfriend, will come around. But so, the algorithmically, it's basically a done there. The rest, is actually getting some of these companies to work with. And then there's, for people who'd worked with robots know that one thing is to write software that works, and the other is to have a real machine that actually works. And it breaks down all kinds of different ways that are fascinating. And so, there's a big challenge there. But that's almost, it may sound a little bit confusing in the context of our previous discussion because the previous discussion was more about the big dream, how I hoped to have millions of people enjoy this moment of magic. This current discussion about a robot, is something I personally really enjoy, just brings me happiness, I really try to do now everything that just brings me joy, I maximize that 'cause robots are awesome. But two, given my like little bit growing platform, I want to use the opportunity to educate people. Like robots are cool. And if I think they're cool, I hope be able to communicate why they're cool to others. So, this little robot experiment is a little bit of research project too, there's a couple of publications with MIT folks around that. But the other is just to make some cool videos and explain to people how they actually work. And as opposed to people being scared of robots, they could still be scared, but also excited, like see the dark side, the beautiful side, the magic of what it means to bring, for a machine to become a robot. I want to inspire people with that. But that's less, it's interesting because I think the big impact in terms of the dream does not have to do with embodied AI. So, it does not need to have a body. I think the refrigerator's enough, that for an AI system just to have a voice and to hear you, that's enough for loneliness. The embodiment is just- - By embodiment, you mean the physical structure. - Physical instantiation of intelligence. So, it's a legged robot, or even just a thing. I have a few other of humanoid robot, a little humanoid robot maybe I'll keep them on the table, is like walks around, or even just like a mobile platform they can just like, turn around and look at you, it's like we mentioned with the pen. Something that moves and can look at you, it's like that Butter Robot that asks, what is my purpose? That is really, it's almost like art. There's something about a physical entity that moves around, that's able to look at you and interact with you, that makes you wonder what it means to be human. It like challenges you to think, if that thing looks like he has consciousness, what the hell am I? And I like that feeling, I think that's really useful for us, it's humbling for us humans. But that's less about research, it certainly less about business and more about exploring our own selves, and challenging others to think like, to think about what makes them human. - I love this desire to share the delight of an interaction with a robot. And as you describe it, I actually find myself starting to crave that because we all have those elements from childhood where, or from adulthood, where we experience something, we want other people to feel that. And I think that you're right, I think a lot of people are scared of AI, I think a lot of people are scared of robots. My only experience, and of a robotic-like thing is my Roomba Vacuum, where it goes about, actually, it was pretty good at picking up Costello's hair when he was shed and I was grateful for it. But then when I was on a call or something, and it would get caught on a wire or something, I would find myself getting upset with the Roomba in that moment, I'm like, what are you doing? And obviously it's just doing what it does. But that's a kind of mostly positive, but slightly negative interaction. But what you're describing, it has so much more richness and layers of detail that I can only imagine what those relationships are like. - Well, there's a few, just a quick comment. So, I've had, they're currently in Boston and I have a bunch of Roombas from iRobot. And I did this experiment- - Wait, how many Roombas? [Lex laughing] It sounds like a fleet of Roombas. - Yeah. So, it's probably seven or eight, yeah. - Well, it's a lot of Roombas. This place is very clean. - Well, so, this, I'm kind of waiting, this is the place we're currently in Austin, is way larger than I need. But I basically got it to make sure I have room for robots. - So, you have these seven or so Roombas, you deploy all seven at once? - Oh, no, I do different experience with them, different experiments with them. So, one of the things I want to mention, is this is a, I think there was a YouTube video that inspired me to try this, is I got them to scream in pain and moan in pain whenever they were kicked or contacted. And I did that experiment to see how I would feel. I meant to do like a YouTube video on it, but then it just seemed very cruel. - Did any Roomba rights activists come at you? - Like I think if I released that video, I think it's going to make me look insane, which I know people know I'm already insane- - Now, you have to release the video. [Lex laughing] - Sure. Well, I think maybe if I contextualize it by showing other robots like to show why this is fascinating, because ultimately, I felt like there were human almost immediately. And that display of pain was what did that. - Giving them a voice. - Giving them a voice, especially a voice of dislike, of pain. - I have to connect you to my friend Eddie Chang, he studied speech and language, he's a neurosurgeon, and we're life-long friends. He studied speech and language, but he describes some of these more primitive, visceral vocalizations, cries, groans, moans of delight, other sounds as well, use your imagination, as such powerful rudders for the other, for the emotions of other people. And so, I find it fascinating, I can't wait to see this video. So, is the video available online? - No, I haven't recorded it, I just hit a bunch of Roombas that are able to scream in pain in my Boston place. [Andrew laughing] So, like people already- - Next podcast episode with Lex, maybe we'll have that one, who knows? - So, the thing is like people, I've noticed because I talk so much about love and it's really who I am, I think they want to, to a lot of people, seems like there's there got to be a dark person in there somewhere. And I thought if I release videos of Roombas screaming and they're like, yep, yep, that guy's definitely insane. - What about like shouts of glee and delight, you could do that too, right? - Well, I don't know how to, to me, delight is quiet, right? - You're a Russian. Americans are much louder than Russians. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. But like I don't, unless you're talking about like, I don't know how you would have sexual relationships with the Roomba. - Well, I wasn't necessarily saying a sexual delight, but- - Trust me, I tried. I'm just kidding, that's a joke, internet. Okay [giggles] but I was fascinated in the psychology of how little it took. 'Cause you mentioned you had a negative relationship with a Roomba. - Well, I'd find that mostly, I took it for granted. - Yeah. - It just served me, it collected Costello's hair. And then when it would do something I didn't like, I would get upset with it. So, that's not a good relationship, it was taken for granted and I would get upset and then I'd park it again, and I just like you're in the corner. - Yeah. - But there's a way to frame it being quite dumb as almost cute. You're almost connecting with it for its dumbness. And I think that's artificial intelligence problem. - [Andrew] It's interesting. - I think flaws should be feature, not a bug. - So, along the lines of this, the different sorts of relationships that one could have with robots, and the fear, but also some of the positive relationships that one could have, there's so much dimensionality, there's so much to explore. But power dynamics in relationships are very interesting, because the obvious ones, the unsophisticated view of this, is one, there's a master and a servant, right? But there's also manipulation, there's benevolent manipulation, children do this with parents, puppies do this. Puppies turn their head and look cute and maybe give out a little noise, kids coup and parents always think that they're doing this because they love the parent, but in many ways, studies show that those coups are ways to extract the sorts of behaviors and expressions from the parent that they want. The child doesn't know it's doing this, it's completely subconscious, but it's benevolent manipulation. So, there's one version of fear of robots that I hear a lot about that I think most people can relate to where the robots take over and they become the masters and we become the servants. But there could be another version that in certain communities that I'm certainly not a part of, but they call topping from the bottom, where the robot is actually manipulating you into doing things, but you are under the belief that you are in charge, but actually they're in charge. And so, I think that's one that if we could explore that for a second, you could imagine it wouldn't necessarily be bad, although it could lead to bad things. The reason I want to explore this, is I think people always default to the extreme, like the robots take over and we're in little jail cells and they're out having fun and ruling the universe. What sorts of manipulation can a robot potentially carry out, good or bad? - Yeah. Just so, there's a lot of good and bad manipulation between humans, right? Just like you said. [Lex sighing] To me [sighing] especially like you said [giggles] topping from the bottom, is that the term? - I think someone from MIT told me that term. [Lex laughing] It wasn't Lex. - I think. So, first of all, there's power dynamics in bed, and power dynamics in relationships, and power dynamics on the street, and in the work environment, those are all very different. I think power dynamics can make human relationships, especially romantic relationships fascinating and rich and fulfilling and exciting and all those kinds of things. So, I don't think in themselves they're bad, and the same goes with robots. I really love the idea that a robot will be at top or a bottom in terms of like power dynamics. And I think everybody should be aware of that. And the manipulation is not so much manipulation, but a dance of like pulling away, a push and pull, and all those kinds of things. In terms of control, I think we're very, very, very far away from AI systems that are able to lock us up. To lock us up in, like to have so much control that we basically cannot live our lives in the way that we want. I think there's a, in terms of dangers of AI systems, there's much more dangers that have to do with autonomous weapon systems and all those kinds of things. So, the power dynamics as exercised in the struggle between nations and war and all those kinds of things. But in terms of personal relationships, I think power dynamics are a beautiful thing. Now, there's of course, going to be all those kinds of discussions about consent and rights and all those kinds of things. - Well, here, we're talking about, I always say in any discussion around this, if we need to define a really the context, it always should be consensual, age-appropriate, context-appropriate, species-appropriate, but now we're talking about human-robot interactions. And so, I guess that- - No, I actually was trying to make a different point, which is I do believe that robots will have rights down the line. And I think in order for us to have deep, meaningful relationships with robots, we would have to consider them as entities in themselves that deserve respect. And that's a really interesting concept that I think people are starting to talk about a little bit more, but it's very difficult for us to understand how entities that are other than human. I mean, the same as with dogs and other animals can have rights on a level as humans. - Well, yeah. We can't and nor should we do whatever we want with animals, we have a USDA, we have Department of Agriculture that deal with animal care and use committees for research, for farming and ranching and all that. So, when you first said it, I thought, wait, why would, there'll be a bill of robotic rights, but it absolutely makes sense in the context of everything we've been talking about up until now. If you're willing, I'd love to talk about dogs, because you've mentioned dogs a couple of times, a robot dog, you had a biological dog. Yeah. - Yeah. I had a Newfoundland named Homer for many years growing up. - In Russia or in the U.S.? - In the United States. And he was about, he's over 200 pounds, that's a big dog. - That's a big dog. - People know Newfoundland. So, he's this black dog that's a really a long hair and just a kind soul. I think perhaps that's true for a lot of large, but he thought he was a small dog. So, he moved like that, and- - Was he your dog? - Yeah, yeah. - So, you had him since he was fairly young? - Since the very, very beginning, till the very, very end. And one of the things, I mean, he had this kind of a, we mentioned like the Roombas, he had kind-hearted dumbness about him that was just overwhelming, it's part of the reason I named him Homer, because it's after Homer Simpson, in case people are wondering which Homer I'm referring to. [Andrew laughing] And so, there's a. Yeah, exactly. There's a clumsiness that was just something that immediately led to a deep love for each other. And one of the, I mean, he was always, it's the shared moments, he was always there for so many a nights together, that's a powerful thing about a dog that he was there through all the loneliness, through all the tough times, through the successes and all those kinds of things. And I remember, I mean, that was a really moving moment for me, I still miss him to this day. - How long ago did he die? - Maybe 15 years ago. So, it's been awhile. But it was the first time I've really experienced like the feeling of death. So, what happened, is he got a cancer. And so, he was dying slowly. And then there's a certain point he couldn't get up anymore. Now, there's a lot of things that could say here that I struggle with. Maybe he suffered much longer than he needed to, that's something I really think about a lot. But I remember when I had to take him to the hospital and the nurses couldn't carry him, right? So, you're talking about a 200 pound dog and I was really into power lifting at the time. And I remember they tried to figure out all these kinds of ways to. So, in order to put them to sleep, they had to take them into a room. And so, I had to carry him everywhere. And here's this dying friend of mine that I just had to, first of all, that was really difficult to carry, somebody that heavy when they're not helping you out. And, yeah. So, I remember it was the first time seeing a friend laying there and seeing life drain from his body. And that realization that we're here for a short time was made so real, that here is friend that was there for me the week before, the day before, and now he's gone. And that was, I don't know, that spoke to the fact that he could be deeply connected with the dog. Also spoke to the fact that the shared moments together that led to that deep friendship will make life so amazing, but it also spoke to the fact that death is a motherfucker. So, I know you've lost Costello recently. - Yeah. - And you can- - And as you're saying this, I'm definitely fighting back the tears. I thank you for sharing that. That I guess we're about to both cry over, I don't want to say dogs [laughing] that it was bound to happen just given when this is happening. Yeah, it's- - How long did you know that Costello was not doing well? - We'll, let's see, a year ago during the start of, about six months into the pandemic, he started getting abscesses and he was not, his behavior change and something really changed. And then I put him on testosterone which helped a lot of things. It certainly didn't cure everything, but it helped a lot of things, he was dealing with joint pain, sleep issues, and then it just became a very slow decline to the point where two, three weeks ago, he had a closet full of medication. I mean, this dog was, it was like a pharmacy. It's amazing to me when I looked at it the other day, I still haven't cleaned up and removed all those things, 'cause I can't quite bring myself to do it, but- - Do you think he was suffering? - Well, so, what happened, was about a week ago, it was really just about a week ago, it's amazing. He was going up the stairs, I saw him slip. And he was a big guy, he wasn't 200 pounds, but he was about 90 pounds, he's a bulldog, he was pretty big and he was fit. And then I noticed that he wasn't carrying a foot in the back like it was injured, it had no feeling at all. He never liked me to touch his hind paws, and I could do, that thing was just flopping there. And then the vet found some spinal degeneration and I was told that the next one would go. Did he suffer? Sure, hope not, but something changed in his eyes. - Yeah. - Yeah, it's the eyes again, I know you and I spend long hours on the phone and tell you about like the eyes and what they convey and what they mean about internal states and for sake of robots and biology of other kinds, but- - You think something about him was gone in his eyes? - I think he was real, here, I am anthropomorphizing, I think he was realizing that one of his great joys in life, which was to walk and sniff and pee on things. [Lex laughing] This dog. - The fundamental. - Loved to pee on things, it was amazing. I've wondered where he put it, he was like a reservoir of urine, it was incredible. I think, oh, that's Eddie, he'd put like one drop on the 50 millionth plant. And then we get to the 50 millionth in one plant, and he just have, leave a puddle. And here I am talking about Costello peeing. He was losing that ability to stand up and do that, he was falling down while he was doing that. And I do think he started to realize. And the passage was easy and peaceful, but I'll say this, I'm not ashamed to say it, I mean, I wake up every morning since then just, I don't even make the conscious decision to allow my self to cry, I wake up crying. And I'm unfortunately able to make it through the day, thanks to the great support of my friends and you and my family, but I miss him, man. - You miss him? - Yeah, I miss him. And I feel like, Homer, Costello, the relationship to one's dog is so specific part. - So, that part of you is gone? - That's the hard thing. What I think is different, is that I made the mistake, I think. Moreover, I hope it was a good decision, but sometimes I think I made the mistake of I brought Costello a little bit to the world through the podcast or posting about him, I anthropomorphized about him in public. Let's be honest, I have no idea what his mental life was, or his relationship to me. And I'm just exploring all this for the first time 'cause he was my first dog, but I raised him since he was seven weeks. - Yeah, you got hold it together, I noticed the episode you released on Monday, you mentioned Costello. Like you brought them back to life for me for that brief moment. - Yeah. But he's gone. - That's the, he's going to be gone for a lot of people too. - Well, this is what I'm struggling with. I think that maybe you're pretty good at this. Like, have you done this before? [Andrew laughing] This is the challenge. Is that actually part of me. I know how to take care of myself pretty well. - Yeah. - Not perfectly, but pretty well. And I have good support. I do worry a little bit about how it's going to land and how people will feel. I'm concerned about their internalization. So that's something I'm still iterating on. - And you have to watch you struggle, which is fascinating. - Right. And I've mostly been shielding them from this, but what would make me happiest is if people would internalize some of Costello's best traits. And his best traits were that he was incredibly tough. I mean, he was a, 22-inch-neck bulldog, the whole thing. He was just born that way. What was so beautiful is that his toughness has never what he rolled forward. It was just how sweet and kind he was. And so if people can take that, then there's a win in there someplace, so. - I think there's some ways in which she should probably live on in your podcast too. You should, I mean, it's such a, one of the things I loved about his role in your podcast is that he brought so much joy to you. We mentioned the robots. - Mm-hmm. - Right? I think that's such a powerful thing to bring that joy into, like, allowing yourself to experience that joy, to bring that joy to others, to share it with others. That's really powerful. And I mean, not to, this is like the Russian thing, is [chuckles] it touched me when Lucy Kay had that moment that I keep thinking about in this show \\\"Louie,\\\" or like an old man was criticizing Louis for whining about breaking up with his girlfriend, and he was saying like the most beautiful thing about love, they made a song that's catchy now that's now making me feel horrible saying it, but like, is the loss. The loss really also is making you realize how much that person, that dog meant to you. And like allowing yourself to feel that loss and not run away from that loss is really powerful. And in some ways that's also sweet, just like the love was the loss is also sweet because you know that you felt a lot for that through your friend. So I, and like continue to bring that joy. I think it would be amazing to the podcast. I hope to do the same with [laughing] robots, or whatever else is the source of joy, right? And maybe, do you think about one day getting another dog? - Yeah, in time. You're hitting on all the key buttons here. I want that to, we're thinking about ways to kind of immortalize Costello in a way that's real, not just creating some little logo or something silly. Costello much like David Goggins is a person, but Goggins also has grown into kind of a verb. You're going to Goggins this or you're going to, and there's an adjective. Like that's extreme. Like it, I think that for me, Costello was all those things. He was a being, he was his own being, he was a noun, a verb and an adjective. So, and he had this amazing super power that I wish I could get, which is this ability to get everyone else to do things for you without doing a thing. [Lex laughing] The Costello effect, as I call it. - So is an idea I hope he lives on. - Yes. Thank you for that. This actually has been very therapeutic for me, which actually brings me to a question, we're friends, we're not just co-scientists, colleagues working on a project together and in the world, that's somewhat similar. - Just two dogs. - Just two dogs basically. But let's talk about friendship, because I think that I certainly know as a scientist that there are elements that are very lonely of the scientific pursuit. There are elements of many pursuits that are lonely. Music, Math always seem to me like they're like the loneliest people. Who knows if that's true or not. Also people work in teams. And sometimes people are surrounded by people interacting with people and they feel very lonely. But for me, and I think as well for you, friendship is an incredibly strong force in making one feel like certain things are possible or worth reaching for, maybe even making us compulsively reach for them. So, when you were growing up, you grew up in Russia until what age? - 13. - Okay. And then you moved directly to Philadelphia? - To Chicago. - [Andrew] Chicago. - And then Philadelphia, and San Francisco and Boston and so on. But really to Chicago, that's where I went to high school. - Do you have siblings? - Older brother. - But most people don't know that. [Lex laughing] - Yeah, he is a very different person. But somebody I definitely look up to. So he's a wild man. He's extrovert, he was into, I mean, so he's also scientists, a bio engineer, but he's, when we were growing up, he was the person who did, drank and did every drug. And, but also as the life of the party. And I just thought he was the, when your older brother, five years older, he was the coolest person that I was wanting to be him. So for that, he definitely had a big influence. But I think for me in terms of friendship, growing up, I had one really close friend. And then when I came here I had another close friend, but I'm very, I believe, I don't know if I believe, but I draw a lot of strength from deep connections with other people, and just the small number of people. Just a really small number of people. That's when I moved to this country, I was really surprised how, like, there were these large groups of friends, quote, unquote. But the depth of connection was not there at all from my sort of perspective. Now, I moved to the suburb of Chicago, was Naperville. It's more like a middle class, maybe upper middle class. So it's like people that cared more about material possessions than deep human connection. So that added to the thing. But I drove more meaning than almost anything else was from friendship. Early on I had a best friend. His name was, his name is Yura. I don't know how to say it in English. - How do you say in Russian? - Yura. What's his last name? Do you remember if was... [Lex chuckles] - Mikolov. Yura Mikolov. So we just spent all our time together. There's also a group of friends. Like, I dunno, it's like eight guys. In Russia growing up, it's like parents didn't care if you're coming back at certain hour. So we'll spent all day, all night just playing soccer, usually called football, and just talking about life and all those kinds of things, even at that young age. I think people in Russia and Soviet Union grew up much quicker. [Lex chuckles] I think the education system at the university level is world-class in the United States in terms of like, really creating really big, powerful minds. At least they used to be, but I think that they aspire to that. But the education system for like, for younger kids in the Soviet Union was incredible. Like they did not treat us as kids. The level of literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky. - When you were a small child? - Yeah. - Amazing. Amazing. - And like the level of mathematics, and you're made to feel like shit if you're not good at mathematics. Like we, I think in this country, there's more like, especially young kids 'cause they're so cute. Like they're being babied. We only start to really push adults later in life. Like, so if you want to be the best in the world at this, then you get to be pushed. But we were pushed at a young age. Everybody was pushed. And that brought out the best in people. I think it really forced people to discover, like discover themselves in the Goggin style, but also discover what they're actually passionate about, what they're not. - Is this true for boys and girls? Were they pushed equally there? - Yeah. They were pushed. Yeah, they were pushed equally, I would say. There was a, obviously there was more, not obviously, but at least from my memories, more of a, what's the right way to put it? But there was like gender roles, but not in a negative connotation. It was the red dress versus the suit and tie kind of connotation, which is like, there's a, like guys like lifting heavy things and girls like creating beautiful art, and, like there's- - A more traditional view of gender, more 1950, '60s. - But we didn't think in terms of, at least at that age, in terms of like roles and then like a homemaker or something like that or not, it was more about what people care about. Like girls cared about this set of things, and guys cared about the set of things. I think mathematics and engineering was something that guys cared about and sort of, at least my perception of that time. And then girls cared about beauty. So like guys want to create machines, girls want to create beautiful stuff. [Lex laughing] And now, of course, that I don't take that forward in some kind of philosophy of life, but it's just the way I grew up and the way I remember it. But all, everyone worked hard. The value of hard work was instilled in everybody. And through that, I think it's a little bit of hardship. Of course also economically everybody was poor, especially with the collapse of the Soviet Union. There's poverty everywhere. You didn't notice it as much, but there was a, because there's not much material possessions, there was a huge value placed on human connection. Just meeting with neighbors, everybody knew each other. We lived in an apartment building very different than you have in the United States these days. Everybody knew each other. You would get together, drink vodka, smoke cigarettes, and play guitar and sing sad songs about life. - What's with the sad songs in the Russian thing? I mean, Russians do I express joy from time to time. - Yeah, they do. - Certainly you do. But what do you think that's about? Is it 'cause it's cold there? But it's called other places too, right? - I think, let's just, first of all the Soviet Union, the echoes of World War II and the millions and millions and millions of people that, civilians that were slaughtered, and also starvation is there, right? So like the echoes of that, of the ideas, the literature, the art is there. Like that's a grandparents, that's parents, that's all there. So that contributes to it, that life can be absurdly unexplainably cruel. At any moment everything can change. So that's in there. Then I think there's an empowering aspect to finding beauty in suffering that then everything else is beautiful too. It's like, if you just linger or it's like, why you meditate on death? Is like, if you just think about the worst possible case and find beauty in that, then everything else is beautiful too. And so you write songs about the dark stuff. And that's somehow helps you deal with whatever comes. There's a hopelessness to the Soviet Union that, like, inflation, all those kinds of things where people were sold dreams and never delivered. And so like, there's a, if you don't sing songs about sad things, you're going to become cynical about this world. - Mm-hmm. Interesting. - So they don't want to give in to cynicism. Now, a lot of people did, one of the, but that is the battle against cynicism. One of the things that may be common in Russia is a kind of cynicism about, like, if I told you the thing I said earlier about dreaming about robots, it's very common for people to dismiss that dream, of saying, no, that's not, that's too wild. Like, who else do you know that did that? Or you want to start a podcast? Like who else? Like nobody's making money on podcasts. Like, why do you want to start a podcast? That kind of mindset I think is quite common, which is why I would say entrepreneurship in Russia is still not very good. Which to be a business, like, to be an entrepreneur you have to dream big, and you have to have others around you, like friends and support group that make you dream big. But if you don't give in to cynicism and appreciate the beauty in the unfairness of life, the absurd unfairness of life, then I think it just makes you appreciative of everything. It's like a, it's a prerequisite for gratitude. And so, yeah, I think that instilled in me ability to appreciate everything, just like everything. Everything's amazing. And then also there is a culture of like romanticizing everything. Like, it's almost like romantic relationships were very like soap opera, like is very like over the top dramatic. And I think that it was instilled in me too, not only do I appreciate everything about life, but I get like emotional about it. In a sense, like, I get like a visceral feeling of joy for everything. And the same with friends or people of the opposite sex. Like, there's a deep, like emotional connection there that like [laughing] that's like way too dramatic too. Like, I guess relative to what the actual moment is. But I derive so much deep, like dramatic joy from so many things in life. And I think I would attributed that to the upbringing in Russia. But the thing that sticks most of all is the friendship. And have now since then had one other friend like that in the United States, he lives in Chicago. His name is Matt. And slowly here and there accumulating really fascinating people, but I'm very selective with that. Funny enough, the few times, it's not few it's a lot of times now interacting with Joe Rogan [chuckles] it's sounds surreal to say, but there was a kindred spirit there. Like I've connected with him. And there's been people like that also in the grappling sports that are really connected with. I've actually struggled, which is why I'm so glad to be your friend, is I've struggled to connect with scientists. - They can be a little bit wooden sometimes. - [Lex] Yeah. - Even the biologist. I mean, one thing that I, well, I'm so struck by the fact that you work with robots, you're an engineer, AI, science technology, and that all sounds like hardware, right? But what you're describing and I know is true about you is this deep emotional life and this resonance and it's really wonderful. I actually think it's one of the reasons why so many people, scientists and otherwise have gravitated towards you and your podcast is because you hold both elements. In the Hermann Hesse's book, I don't know if you, \\\"Narcissus and Goldmund,\\\" right? It's about these elements of the logical rational mind and the emotional mind and how those are woven together. And if people haven't read it, they should, and you embody the full picture. And I think that's so much of what draws people to you. - I've read every Hermann Hesse book by the way. - As usual [chuckles] as usual I've done about 9% of what life is. No, it's true. You mentioned Joe, who is a phenomenal human being, not just for his amazing accomplishments, but for how he shows up to the world one on one. I think I heard him say the other day on an interview, he said, there is no public or private version of him. And he's like, this is me. He said that it was beautiful. He said, I'm like the fish that got through the net. And there is no onstage offstage version. And you're absolutely right. And I. - Fish. [Lex laughing] - So, but, well, you guys, I have a question actually about- - But that's a really good point about public and private life. He was a huge, if I could just comment real quick. Like that, he was a, I've been a fan of Joe for a long time, but he's been an inspiration to not have any difference between public and private life. I actually had a conversation with Naval about this, and he said that you can't have a rich life, like exciting life if you're the same person publicly and privately. And I think I understand that idea, but I don't agree with it. I think that's really fulfilling and exciting to be the same person privately and publicly with very few exceptions. Now that said, I don't have any really strange sex kinks. So like, I feel like it can be open with basically everything. I don't have anything I'm ashamed of. There's some things that could be perceived poorly, like the screaming Roombas, but I'm not ashamed of them. I just have to present them in the right context. But there's a freedom to being the same person in private as in public. And that Joe made me realize that you can be that. And also to be kind to others. It sounds kind of absurd, but I really always enjoyed like being good to others. Like just being kind towards others. But I always felt like the world didn't want me to be. Like, there's so much negativity when I was growing up, like just around people. If you actually just notice how people talk, they, from like, complaining about the weather, this could be just like the big cities that I've visited. But there's a general negativity, and positivity is kind of suppressed. You're not, one, you're not seen as very intelligent, and two, there's a kind of, you're seen as like a little bit of a weirdo. And so I always felt like I had to hide that. And what Joe made me realize, one, I could be fully just the same person private and public, and two, I can embrace being kind, in just, in the way that I like, in the way I know how to do. And sort of for me on like, on Twitter or like publicly, whenever I say stuff, that means saying stuff simply almost to the point of cliche. And like, I have the strength now to say it, even if I'm being mocked. [Lex laughing] You know what I mean? Like, just it's okay. If everything's going to be okay. Okay, some people will think you're dumb. They're probably right. The point is, like, just enjoy being yourself. And that Joe, more than almost anybody else, because he's so successful at it, inspired me to do that. Be kind and be the same person, private and public. - I love it. And I love the idea that authenticity doesn't have to be oversharing, right? That it doesn't mean you reveal every detail of your life. It's a way of being true to an essence of oneself. - Right. There's never a feeling when you deeply think and introspect that you're hiding something from the world or you're being dishonest in some fundamental way. So, yeah, that's truly liberating. It allows you to think, it allows you to like think freely, to speak freely, to just to be freely. That said, it's not like there's not still a responsibility to be the best version of yourself. So, I'm very careful with the way I say something. So, the whole point, it's not so simple to express the spirit that's inside you with words. I mean, some people are much better than others. I struggle. Like oftentimes when I say something and I hear myself say it, it sounds really dumb and not at all what I meant. So that's the responsibility you have. It's not just like being the same person publicly and privately means you can just say whatever the hell. It means there's still responsibility to try to be, to express who you truly are. And that's hard. [Lex chuckles] - It hard. And I think that, we have this pressure, all people, when I say we, I mean all humans, and maybe robots too, feel this pressure to be able to express ourselves in that one moment in that one form. And it is beautiful when somebody, for instance, can capture some essence of love or sadness or anger or something in a song or in a poem or in a short quote, but perhaps it's also possible to do it in aggregate, all the things how you show up. For instance, one of the things that initially drew me to want to get to know you as a human being and a scientist and eventually we became friends, was the level of respect that you brought to your podcast listeners by wearing a suit. - Yeah. - I'm being serious here. I was raised thinking that if you overdress a little bit, overdressed by American, certainly by American standards, you're overdressed for a podcast, but it's genuine. You're not doing it for any reason, except I have to assume, and I assumed at the time, that it was because you have a respect for your audience, you respect them enough to show up a certain way for them. It's for you also, but it's for them. - Yeah. - And I think between that and your commitment to your friendship, just the way that you talk about friendships and love and the way you hold up these higher ideals, I think at least as a consumer of your content and as your friend, what I find, is that in aggregate, you're communicating who you are, it doesn't have to be one quote or something. And I think that we're sort of obsessed by like the one Einstein quote, or the one line of poetry or something, but I think you so embody the way that, and Joe as well, it's about how you live your life and how you show up as a collection of things and said and done. - Yeah, that that's, and so, the aggregate is the goal, the tricky thing, and Jordan Peterson talks about this because he's under attack way more than you and I will ever be, but- - Right now? - For now, right? This is very true for now. That the people who attack on the internet, this is one of the problems with Twitter, is they don't consider the aggregate, they take a single statements. And so, one of the defense mechanisms, like again why Joe has been an inspiration, is that when you in aggregate, a good person, a lot of people will know that. And so, that makes you much more immune to the attacks of people that bring out an individual statement that might be a misstatement of some kind, or doesn't express who you are. And so, that, I like that idea is the aggregate. And the power of the podcast, is you have hundreds of hours out there, and being yourself and people get to know who you are. And once they do, and you post pictures of screaming Roombas as you kick them, they will understand that you don't mean well. By the way, as a side comment, I don't know if I want to release this because it's not just the Roombas- - You have a whole dungeon of robots. - Okay. So, this is a problem, the Boston Dynamics came up against this problem. But, let me work this out like workshop this out with you, and maybe because we'll post this, people will let me know. So, there's legged robots, they look like a dog, I'm trying to create a very real human-robot connection, but like they're also incredible because you can throw them like off of a building and they'll land fine. And this beautiful. - That's amazing. I've seen the Instagram videos of like cats jumping off of like fifth story buildings and then walking away. But no one should throw their cat out of a window of a building. - Well, this is the problem I'm experiencing, all certainly kicking the robots, its really fascinating how they recover from those kicks. But like just seeing myself do it and also seeing others do it, it just does not look good, and I don't know what to do with that. 'Cause it's such a- - Ill 'do it. [Lex laughing] - See. But you don't, 'cause you are- - A robot, no, I'm kidding. What's interesting? - Yeah. - Before today's conversation, I probably could do it, and I'm thinking about robots, bills of rights and things. Not to satisfy you or to satisfy anything, except that if they have some sentience aspect to their being, then I would load to kick it. - I don't think we'd be able to kick it, you might be able to kick the first time, but not the second, this is the problem of experience. One of the cool things, is one of the robots I'm working with, you can pick it up by one leg and is dangling, and you can throw it in any kind of way and it'll land correctly. So, it's really- - I had a friend who had a cat like that. [Lex laughing] - Oh man, we look forward to the letters on the cat- - Oh no, I'm not suggesting anyone did that, but he had this cat, and the cat, he would just throw it onto the bed from across the room, and then it would run back for more, or somehow that was the nature of the relationship. I think no one should do that to an animal, but this cat seemed to return for whatever reason. - But a robot is a robot, and it's fascinating to me how hard it is for me to do that. So, it's unfortunate, but I don't think I can do that to a robot. Like I struggle with that. So, for me to be able to do that with a robot, I have to almost get like into the state that I imagine like doctors get into when they're doing surgery, like I have to do what robotics colleagues of mine do, which is like start seeing it as an object. - Dissociate. - Like dissociate. So, it was just fascinating that I have to do that in to do that with a robot. I just want to take that little bit of a tangent. - No, I think it's an important thing. I mean, I'm not shy about the fact that for many years I've worked on experimental animals, and that's been a very challenging aspect of being a biologist. Mostly mice, but in the past no longer, thank goodness 'cause I just don't like doing it, larger animals as well. And now I work on humans, which I can give consent, verbal consent. So, I think that it's extremely important to have an understanding of what the guidelines are and where one's own boundaries are around this. It's not just an important question, it might be the most important question before any work can progress. - So, you asked me about friendship. I know you have a lot of thoughts about friendship, what do you think is the value of friendship in life? - Well, for me personally, just because of my life trajectory and arc friendship, and I should say, I do have some female friends that are just friends, they're completely platonic relationships, but it's been mostly male friendship to me, has been- - It has been all male friendships to me actually, yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah. - It's been an absolute lifeline. They are my family, I have a biological family and I have great respect and love for them and an appreciation for them, but it's provided me the, I won't even say confidence because there's always an anxiety in taking any good risk, or any risk worth taking. It's given me the sense that I should go for certain things and try certain things to take risk to weather that anxiety. And I don't consider myself a particularly competitive person, but I would sooner die than disappoint, or let down one of my friends. I can think of nothing worse actually, than disappointing one of my friends, everything else is secondary to me. - What disappointment? - Disappoint, meaning not, I mean, certainly I strive always to show up as best I can for the friendship, and that can be in small ways. That can mean making sure the phone is away, sometimes it's about, I'm terrible with punctuality 'cause I'm an academic. And so, I just get lost in time and I don't mean anything, but it's striving to, to listen to, to enjoy good times and to make time. It kind of goes back to this first variable we talked about, to make sure that I spend time and to get time in person and check in. And I think there's so many ways in which friendship is vital to me, it's it's actually to me, what makes life worth living. - Yeah. Well, there's a, I am surprised like with the high school friends how we don't actually talk that often these days in terms of time, but every time we see each other, it's immediately right back to where we started. So, I struggled that how much time you really allocate, for the friendship to be deeply meaningful because they're always there with me even if we don't talk often. So, there's a kind of loyalty. I think maybe it's a different style, but I think to me, friendship is being there in the hard times, I think. Like I'm much more reliable when you're going through shit than in like- - You're pretty reliable anyway. - No, but if you're like a wedding or something like that, or like, I don't know, like you want an award of some kind, yeah, I'll congratulate the shit out of you, but like that's not, and I'll be there, but that's not as important to me as being there when like nobody else is like just being there when shit hits the fan, or something's tough where the world turns their back on you, all those kinds of things, that, to me, that's where friendship is meaningful. - Well, I know that to be true about you and that's a felt thing and a real thing with you. Let me ask one more thing about that actually, because I'm not a practitioner Jujitsu, I know you are, Joe is, but years ago, I read a book that I really enjoyed, which is Sam Sheridan's book, \\\" A Fighter's Heart,\\\" he talks about all these different forms of martial arts. And maybe it was in the book, maybe it was in an interview, but he said that fighting, or being in physical battle with somebody, Jujitsu boxing or some other form of direct physical contact between two individuals creates this bond unlike any other. Because he said it's like a one night stand, you're sharing bodily fluids with somebody that you barely know. - Yeah. - And I chuckled about it 'cause it's kind of funny and it kind of tongue in cheek. But at the same time, I think this is a fundamental way in which members of a species bond is through physical contact. And certainly, there are other forms, there's cuddling, and there's hand holding, and there's in their sexual intercourse, and there's all sorts of things. - What's cuddling? I haven't heard of it. - I heard this recently, I didn't know this term, but there's a term, they've turned the noun cupcake into a verb, cupcaking it turns out, I just learned about this. Cupcaking is when you spend time just cuddling. I didn't know about this. You heard it here first, although I heard it first just the other day. Cupcaking is actually a- - Cuddling is everything, it's not just like, is it in bed, or is it in the coach? Like what's cuddling? I do look up what cuddling is- - We need to look at this up and we need to define the variables. I think it definitely has to do with physical contact, I'm told, but in terms of battle, a competition, and the Sheridan quote, I'm just curious. So, do you get close, or feel a bond with people that, for instance, you rolled Jujitsu with, or even though you don't know anything else about them, was he right about this? - Yeah, I mean on many levels. He also has the book, what? \\\"A Fighter's Mind.\\\" - Yeah, that was the third one. He's actually an excellent writer. What's interesting about him, just briefly about Sheridan, I don't know him, but I did a little bit of research, he went to Harvard, he was an art major at Harvard, he claims all he did was smoke cigarettes and do art. I don't know if his art was any good. And I think his father was in the SEAL teams. And then when he got out of Harvard, graduated, he took off around the world learning all the forms of martial arts, and was early to the kind of ultimate fighting kind of mixed martial arts and things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. - It's amazing. I don't actually remember it, but I read it, and I remember thinking that was an amazing encapsulation of what makes fighting like the art, like what makes it compelling. I would say that there's so many ways that Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports in general, is like one of the most intimate things you could do. I don't know if I would describe in terms of bodily liquids and all those kinds of things. - I think he was more or less joking. - I think there's a few ways that it does that. So, one, because you're so vulnerable [sighs] So, the honesty of stepping on the mat and often all of us have ego thinking we're better than we are at this particular art. And then the honesty of being submitted, or being worse than you thought you are and just sitting with that knowledge, that kind of honesty, we don't get to experience it in most of daily life. We can continue living somewhat of an illusion of our conceptions of ourselves 'cause people are not going to hit us with the reality, the mat speaks only the truth, the reality just hits you. And that vulnerability is the same as like the loss of a loved one, though it's the loss of a reality that you knew before, you now have to deal with this new reality. And when you're sitting there in that vulnerability, and there's these other people that are also sitting in that vulnerability, you get to really connect like, fuck, like I'm not as special as I thought I was, and life is like not, life is harsher than I thought I was, and we're just sitting there with that reality, some of us can put words to them, some we can't. So, I think that definitely, is a thing that at least the intimacy. The other thing is the human contact. There's something about, I mean, like a big hug, like during COVID, very few people hugged me and I hugged them, and I always felt good when they did. Like we were all tested, and especially now we're vaccinated, but there's still people, this is true of San Francisco's, it's true in Boston, they want to keep, not only six feet away, but stay at home and never touch you. That loss of basic humanity is the opposite of what I feel in Jujitsu, where it was like that contact where you're like, I don't give a shit about whatever rules we're supposed to have in society where you have to keep a distance and all that kind of stuff. Just the hug, like the intimacy of a hug, that's like a good bear hug, and you're like just controlling another person, and also there is some kind of love communicated through just trying to break each other's arms. I don't exactly understand why violence is the such a close neighbor to love, but it is. - Well, in the hypothalamus, the neurons that control sexual behavior, but also non-sexual contact, are not just nearby the neurons that control aggression and fighting, they are salt and pepper with those neurons. It's a very interesting, and it almost sounds kind of risky and controversial and stuff, I'm not anthropomorphizing about what this means, but in the brain, those structures are interdigitated, you can't separate them except at a very fine level. And here, the way you describe it, is the same as a real thing. - I do want to make an interesting comment. Again, these are the things that could be taken out of context, but one of the amazing things about Jujitsu, is both guys and girls train it. And I was surprised. So, like I'm a big fan of yoga pants [giggles] at the gym kind of thing. It reveals the beauty of the female form. But the thing is, like girls are dressed in skintight clothes in Jujitsu often. And I found myself not at all, thinking like that at all when training with girls. - Well, the context is very non-sexual. - But I was surprised to learn that. When I first started to Jujitsu, I thought, wouldn't that be kind of weird to train with the opposites that in something so intimate. - So, boys and girls, men and women, they roll Jujitsu together? - Completely. - Interesting. - And the only times girls kind of try to stay away from guys, I mean, there's two contexts, of course, there's always going to be creeps in this world. So, everyone knows who kind of stay away from, and the other is there's a size disparity. So, girls will often try to roll with people a little bit closer weight-wise, But no, that's one of the things that are empowering to women, that's what they fall in love with when they started doing Jujitsu, is first of all, they gain an awareness and a pride over their body, which is great. And then second, they get to [chuckles] especially later on, start submitting big dudes like these bros that come in who are all shredded and like muscular, and they get to technique to exercise dominance over them, and that's a powerful feeling. - You've seen women force a larger guy to tap her, or even choke them up. - Well, I was deadlifting like a four, oh boy, I think it's 495. So, I was really into power-lifting when I started at Jujitsu, and I remember being submitted by, I thought I walked in feeling like I'm going to be, if not the greatest fighter ever, at least top three. And so, as a white belt, you roll in like all happy. And then you realize that as long as you're not applying too much force, that you're having, I remember being submitted many times by like 130, 120-pound girls at our Balance Studios in Philadelphia, that a lot of incredible female Jujitsu players. And that's really humbling too that technique can overpower in combat pure strength. And that's the other thing, there is something about combat that's primal. Like there, it just feels, it feels like we were born to do this. Like that- - We have circuits in our brain that are dedicated to this kind of interaction. There's no question. - And that's what it felt like, it wasn't that I'm learning a new skill. It was like, somehow I am a remembering echoes of something I've learned in the past. - Well, it's like hitting puberty. A child before puberty has no concept of boys and girls having this attraction, regardless of whether or not they're attracted to boys or girl, doesn't matter. At some point, most people, not all, but certainly, but most people, when they hit puberty, suddenly people appear differently, and certain people take on a romantic or sexual interest for the very first time. - Yeah. - And so it's like, it's revealing a circuitry in the brain. It's not like they learn that it's innate. And I think it, when I hear the way you describe Jujitsu and enrolling Jujitsu, it reminds me a little bit, Joe was telling me recently about the first time he went hunting and he felt like it revealed a circuit that was in him all along, but he hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. That's definitely there. And of course, there's the physical activity. One of the interesting things about Jujitsu is it's one of the really strenuous exercises that you can do late into your adult life, like into your 50, 60, 70s, 80s. When I came up, there's a few people in their 80s that were training. And as long as you're smart, as long as you practice techniques and pick your partners correctly, you can do that kind of art. That's late into life. And so you're getting exercise. There's not many activities I find that are amenable to that. So, because it's such a thinking game, the Jujitsu in particular is an art or technique pays off a lot. So you can still maintain, first of all, remain injury free if you use good technique, and also through good technique be able to go, be active with people that are much, much younger. And so that was, to me, that and running are the two activities you can kind of do late in life. Because to me a healthy life has exercises as the piece of the puzzle. - No, absolutely. And I'm glad that we're on the physical component, because I know that there's for you, you've talked before about the crossover between the physical and the intellectual and the mental. Are you still running at ridiculous hours of the night for ridiculously long? - Yeah, so, definitely. I've been running late at night here in Austin. People tell, the area we're in now, people say it's a dangerous area, which I find laughable coming from the bigger cities. No, I run late at night. There's something. - If you see a guy running through Austin at 2:00 a.m. in a suit and tie, it's probably. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah. I mean, I do think about that 'cause I get recognized more and more in Austin. I worry that, but not really, that I get recognized late at night. But there is something about the night that brings out those deep philosophical thoughts and self-reflection, that really enjoy. But recently I started getting back to the grind. So I'm going to be competing or hoping to be compete in September and October. - In Jujitsu? - In Jujitsu, yeah. To get back to competition. And so that requires getting back into a great cardio shape. I've been getting, running as part of my daily routine. - Got it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Well, I always know I can reach you regardless of time zone in the middle of the night, wherever that happens. - Well, part of that has to be just being single and being a programmer. Those two things just don't work well in terms of a steady sleep schedule. - It's not bankers hours kind of work. Nine to five. I want to, you mentioned single. I want to ask you a little bit about the other form of relationship, which is romantic love. So, your parents are still married? - Still married, still happily married. - That's impressive. - [Lex] Yeah. - A rare thing nowadays. - [Lex] Yeah. - So you grew up with that example? - Yeah. I guess that's a powerful thing, right? If there's an example that I think can work. - Yeah. I didn't have that in my own family, but when I see it, it's inspiring and it's beautiful. The fact that they have that, and that was the norm for you, I think is really wonderful. - Well, it was a, in the case of my parents it was interesting to watch 'cause there's obviously tension. Like, there'll be times where they fought and all those kinds of things. They obviously get frustrated with each other and they like, but they find mechanisms how to communicate that to each other, like to make fun of each other a little bit, like to tease, to get some of that frustration out, and then ultimately to reunite and find their joyful moments and be that the energy. I think it's clear 'cause I got together in there I think early 20s, like very, very young. I think you grow together as people. - Yeah. You're still in the critical period of brain plasticity. [laughing] - And also, I mean, it's just like divorce was so frowned upon that you stick it out. And I think a lot of couples especially from that time, the Soviet Union, that's probably applies to a lot of cultures. You stick it out and you put in the work, you learn how to put in the work. And once you do, you start to get to some of those rewarding aspects of being, like through time has sharing so many moments together. That's definitely something that was an inspiration to me, but maybe that's where I have. So I have a similar kind of longing to have a lifelong partner, like to have that kind of view, where same with friendship, lifelong friendship is the most meaningful kind. That there is something with that time of sharing all that time together. Like till death do us part is a powerful thing. Not by force, not because of the religion said it or the government said it or your culture said it, but because you want to. - Do you want children? - Definitely, yeah. Definitely want children. It's- - How many Roombas do you have? - Oh, I thought- - You should, no, no- - Human children? - No, human to human children. - 'Cause I already have the children. - Exactly. What I was saying, you probably need to at least as many human children as you do Roombas. Big family, small family. - So. - In your mind's eyes, they're a bunch of Fridman's running around. - So I'll tell you, like realistically, I can explain exactly my thinking, and this is similar to the robotics work is, if I'm like purely logical right now, my answer would be I don't want kids. Because I just don't have enough time. I have so much going on. But when I'm using the same kind of vision I use for the robots is I know my life will be transformed with the first. Like I know I would love being a father. And so the question of how many, that's on the other side of that hill. It could be some ridiculous number. So I just know that- - I have a feeling and I could be, I don't have a crystal ball, but I don't know. I see an upwards of, certainly three or more come comes to mind. - So much of that has to do with the partner you're with too. So like that, that's such an open question, especially in this society of what the right partnership is. 'Cause I'm deeply empathetic. I want to see, like to me, what I look for in your relationship is for me to be really excited about the passions of another person, like whatever they're into, it doesn't have to be a career success. Any kind of success, just to be excited for them, and for them to be excited for me. And like share in that excitement and build, and build and build. But there was also practical aspects of like, what kind of shit do you enjoy doing together? And I think family is a real serious undertaking. - It certainly is. I mean, I think that I have a friend who said it, I think best, which is that you first have, he's in a very successful relationship and has a family. And he said, you first have to define the role and then you have to cast the right person for the role. [Lex laughing] - Well, yeah, there's some deep aspects of that, but there's also an aspect to which you're not smart enough from this side of it to define the role. I think there's part of it that has to be a leap that you have to take. And I see having kids that way. You just have to go with it and figure it out also. As long as there's love there, like what the hell is life for even? So I've, there's so many incredibly successful people that I know that I've gotten to know that all have kids. And the presence of kids for the most part has only been something that energizes them, something they gave them meaning, something that made them the best version of themselves, like made them more productive, not less, which is fascinating to me. - It is fascinating. I mean, you can imagine if the way that you felt about Homer, the way that I feel and felt about Costello is at all a glimpse of what that must be like then. - Exactly. The downside, the thing I worry more about is the partner side of that. I've seen, the kids are almost universally a source of increased productivity and joy and happiness. Like, yeah, they're a pain in the ass. Yeah, is complicated. Yeah, so and so forth, people like to complain about kids. But then when you actually look past that little shallow layer of complaint, kids are great. The source of pain for a lot of people is if when the relationship doesn't work. And so I'm very kind of concerned about like, dating is very difficult, and I'm a complicated person. And so it's been very difficult to find the right kind of person. But that statement doesn't even make sense because I'm not on dating apps, I don't see people. You're like the first person I saw in awhile. It's like you and Michael Malice and like Joe. So, like, I don't think I've seen like a female. What is it? An element of the female species in quite a while. So, I think you have to put yourself out there. What is it? Daniel Johnston says, true love will find you, but only if you're looking. So there's some element of really taking the leap and putting yourself out there in kind of different situations. And I don't know how to do that when you're behind a computer all the time. - Well, you're a builder and you're a problem solver, and you find solutions, and I'm confident the solution is out there, and. - I think you're implying that I'm going to build the girlfriend, which I think. - Well, and maybe we shouldn't separate this friendship, the notion of friendship and community, and if we go back to this concept of the aggregate, maybe you'll meet this woman through a friend, or maybe you'll or something of that sort. - So, one of the things, I dunno if you feel the same way, I definitely one of those people that just falls in love and that's it. - Yeah, I can't say I'm like that. With Costello it was instantaneous. - Yeah. - It really was. I mean, I know it's not romantic love, but it was instantaneous. No, I, but that's me. And I think that if you know, you know, because that's a good thing that you have there. - It's, I'm very careful with that, because you don't want to fall in love with the wrong person. So I try to be very kind of careful with, I've noticed this because I fall in love with every, like this mug, everything I fall in love with things in this world. So, like, you have to be really careful because a girl comes up to you and says she loves DUSTY HUSKY, that doesn't necessarily mean to marry her tonight. - Yes. And I like the way you said that out loud so that you heard it, you doesn't mean you need to marry her tonight, right? - [Lex] Exactly. - [Andrew] Right. - But I mean, but people are amazing, and people are beautiful and that's, so I'm fully embraced that, but also you have to be careful with relationships. And at the same time, like I mentioned to you offline, I don't, there's something about me that appreciates swinging for the fences and not dating, like doing serial dating, or dating around. - Like you're a one guy, one girl kind of guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - And you said that. - And it's tricky because you want to be careful with that kind of stuff. Especially now there's a growing platform that have a ridiculous amount of female interests of a certain kind. But I'm looking for deep connection, and I'm looking by sending home alone, and every once in a while talking to Stanford professors. - Perfect solution. - On a podcast. - Perfect solution. - Is going to workout great. - It's well, it's part of, that constitutes machine learning of sorts. - Yeah, of sorts. - I do, you mentioned what has now become a quite extensive and expansive public platform, which is incredible. I mean, the number of people out, first time I saw your podcast, I noticed the suit, I was like, he respects his audience, which was great, but I also thought this is amazing. People are showing up for science and engineering and technology information and those discussions and other sorts of discussions. Now, I do want to talk for a moment about the podcast. So my two questions about the podcast are, when you started it, did you have a plan? And regardless of what that answer is, do you know where you're taking it, or would you like to leave us? I do believe in an element of surprise is always fun. But what about the podcast? Do you enjoy the podcast? I mean, your audience certainly includes me, really enjoys the podcast. It's incredible. - So I love talking to people, and there's something about microphones that really bring out the best in people. Like you don't get a chance to talk like this. If you and I were just hanging out, we would have a very different conversation in the amount of focus we allocate to each other. We would be having fun talking about other stuff and doing other things. There'll be a lot of distraction. There would be some phone use and all that kind of stuff. But here we're 100% focused on each other and focus on the idea. And like sometimes playing with ideas that we both don't know the answer to, like a question we don't know the answer to. We're both like fumbling with it, trying to figure out, trying to get some insights at something we haven't really figured out before and together arriving at that. I think that's magical. I don't know why we need microphones for that, but we somehow do. - It feels like doing science. - It feels like doing science for me, definitely. That's exactly it. And I'm really glad you said that because I don't actually often say this, but that's exactly what I felt like. I wanted to talk to friends and colleagues at MIT to do real science together. That's how I felt about it. Like to really talk through problems that are actually interesting, as opposed to like incremental work that we're currently working for for a particular conference. So really asking questions like, what are we doing? Like, where's this headed to? Like, what are the big, is this really going to help us solve, in the case of AI, solve intelligence? Like, is this even working on intelligence? There's a certain sense, which is why I initially called it artificial intelligence. Is like most of us are not working on artificial intelligence. You're working on some very specific problem and a set of techniques, at the time it's machine learning to solve this particular problem. This is not going to take us to a system that is anywhere close to the generalizability of the human mind. Like the kind of stuff the human mind can do in terms of memory, in terms of cognition, in terms of reasoning, common sense reasoning. This doesn't seem to take us there. So the initial impulse was, can I talk to these folks do science together through conversation? And I also thought that there was not enough, I didn't think there was enough good conversations with world-class minds that I got to meet. And not the ones with the book, or like this was just the thing. Oftentimes you go on this tour when you have a book, but there's a lot of minds that don't write books. - And the books constrain the conversation too, when you're talking about this thing, this book. - But there's, I've noticed that, with people that haven't written a book who are brilliant, we get to talk about ideas in a new way. We both haven't actually, when we raise a question, we don't know the answer to it once the question is raised. And we try to arrive there. Like, I dunno, I remember asking questions of world-class researchers in deep learning of, why do neural networks work as well as they do? That question is often loosely asked, but like when you have microphones and you have to think through it, and you have 30 minutes to an hour to think through it together, I think that's science. I think that's really powerful. So that was the one goal. The other one is, again, don't usually talk about this, but there's some sense in which I wanted to have dangerous conversations. Part of the reasons I wanted to wear a suit is like, I want it to be fearless. The reason I don't usually talk about it is because I feel like I'm not good at conversation. So it looks like it doesn't match the current skill level. But I wanted to have really dangerous conversations that I uniquely would be able to do. Not completely uniquely, but like, I'm a huge fan of Joe Rogan, and I had to ask myself, what conversations can I do that Joe Rogan can't? For me, I know I bring this up, but for me that person I thought about at the time was Putin. Like that's why I bring him up. He's just like with Costello, he's not just a person. He's also an idea to me for what I strive for. Just to have those dangerous conversations. And the reason I'm uniquely qualified as both the Russian, but also there's the judo and the martial arts, there's a lot of elements that make me have a conversation he hasn't had before. And there's a few other people that I kept in mind, like Don Knuth, is a computer scientist from Stanford that I thought is one of the most beautiful minds ever. And nobody really talked to him, like really talked to him. He did a few lectures, which people love, but really just have a conversation with him. There's a few people like that. One of them passed away, John Conway, that I never got, we agreed to talk, but he died before we did. There's a few people like that, that I thought like it's such a crime to not hear those folks. And I have the unique ability to know how to purchase a microphone on Amazon and plug it into a device that records audio and then publish it, which seems relatively unique. Like that's not easy in the scientific community. People knowing how to plug in a microphone. - No. They can build Faraday cages, and two-photon microscopes and bioengineer, all sorts of things, but the idea that you could take ideas and export them into a structure or a pseudo structure that people would benefit from seems like a cosmic achievement to them. - I don't know if it's fear or just a basically they haven't tried it, so they haven't learned the skill level. - But I think they're not trained. I mean, we could riff on this for awhile, but I think that, but it's important. And maybe we should, which is that it's, they're not trained to do it. They're trained to think in specific games and specific hypotheses, and many of them don't care to, right? They became scientists because that's where they felt safe, and so why would they leave that Haven of safety? - Well, they also don't necessarily always see the value in it. We're all together learning, you and I are learning the value of this. I think you're probably having an exceptionally successful and amazing podcast that you started just recently. - Thanks to your encouragement. - Well, but there's a raw skill there that's, you're definitely an inspiration to me in how you did the podcast in the level of excellence you reach. But I think you've discovered that that's also an impactful way to do science. That podcast. And I think a lot of scientists have not yet discovered that. That this is a, if they apply same kind of rigor as they do to academic publication or to even conference presentations, and they do that rigor and effort to podcast, whatever that is, that could be a five-minute podcast, a two-hour podcasts, it could be conversational, or it can be more like lecture like, if they apply that effort, you have the potential to reach over time, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of people. And that's really, really powerful. But yeah, for me giving a platform to a few of those folks, especially for me personally, so maybe you can speak to what fields you're drawn to, but I thought computer scientists were especially bad at this. So there's brilliant computer scientists that I thought it would be amazing to explore their mind, explore their thinking. And so that I took that almost as an, on as an effort. And at the same time I had other guests in mind, or people that connect to my own interests. So the wrestling. Wrestling, music, football, both American football and soccer. I have a few particular people that I'm really interested in. Buvaisar Saitiev. The Saitiev brothers, even Khabib for wrestling, just to talk to them, 'cause. - Oh, 'cause you can, you guys can communicate- - In Russian and in wrestling, right? As wrestlers and as Russians. And so that little, it's like an opportunity to explore a mind that I'm able to bring to the world. And also it, I feel like it makes me a better person, just that being that vulnerable and exploring ideas together. I don't know, like good conversation. I don't know how often you have really good conversation with friends, but like podcasts are like that. And it's deeply moving. - It's the best. And what you brought through. I mean, when I saw you sit down with Penrose, Nobel Prize winning physicist, and these other folks that, it's not just 'cause he has a Nobel, it's what comes out of his mouth is incredible. And what you were able to hold in that conversation was so much better, light years beyond what he had any other interviewer, I don't want to even call you an interviewer 'cause it's really about conversation. Light years beyond what anyone else had been able to engage with him was such a beacon of what's possible. And I know that, I think that's what people are drawn to. And there's a certain intimacy, that certainly to people, our friends, as we are, and they know each other, that there's more of that, but there's an intimacy in those kinds of private conversations that are made public. And. - Well, that's the, with you, you're probably starting to realize, and Costello, is like, part of it, because you're authentic and you're putting yourself out there completely, people are almost not just consuming the words you're saying, they also enjoy watching you, Andrew, struggle with these ideas or try to communicate these ideas. They like the flaws, they like a human being. - Oh, good, that flaws. - Well, that's good 'cause I got plenty of those. - But they like the self-critical aspects, like where you're very careful, where you're very self-critical about your flaws. I mean, in that same way, it's interesting I think for people to watch me talk to Penrose, not just because Penrose is communicating ideas, but here's this like silly kid trying to explore ideas. Like they know this kid. There's a human connection that is really powerful. Same, I think with Putin, right? Like it's not just as a good interview with Putin, it's also, here's this kid struggling to talk with one of the most powerful, some will argue dangerous people in the world. They love that. The authenticity that led up to that. And in return, I get to connect, everybody I run to in the street and all those kinds of things, there's a depth of connection there, almost within like a minute or two that's unlike any other. - Yeah, there's an intimacy that you've formed with with them. - Yeah, we've been on this like journey together. And yeah, I have the same thing with Joe Rogan before I ever met him, right? Like I was, because I was a fan of Joe for so many years, there's something, there's a kind of friendship as absurd as it might be to say in podcasting and listening to podcasts. - Yeah. Maybe it fills in a little bit of that or solves a little bit of that loneliness that you've been talking about earlier. - Until the robots are here. [laughing] - I have just a couple more questions, but one of them is on behalf of your audience, which is, I'm not going to ask you the meaning of the hedgehog, but I just want to know, does it have a name? And you don't have to tell us the name, but just, does it have a name? Yes or no? - Well, there's a name he likes to be referred to as, and then there's a private name in the privacy of his own company that we call each other. No. [Lex laughing] I'm not that insane. No, his name is Hedgy. He's a hedgehog. I don't like stuffed animals. But his story is one of minimalism. So I gave away everything I own, now three times in my life. By everything I mean almost everything, kept jeans and shirt and a laptop. And recently it's also been guitar, things like that. But he survived because he was always in, at least in the first two times was in the laptop bag, and he just got lucky. And so I just liked the perseverance of that. And I first saw him in the, the reason I got a stuffed animal, I don't have other stuffed animals, is it was in a thrift store, in this like giant pile of stuffed animals and he jumped out at me, because unlike all the rest of them, he has this intense mean look about him. That he's just, he's upset at life, at the cruelty of life. And it's just, especially in the contrast of the other stuffed animals, they have this dumb smile on their face. If you look at most stuffed animals, they have this dumb look on their face. They're just happy. Is like \\\"Pleasantville.\\\" - It's what we say in neuroscience, they have a smooth cortex, not many form. - Exactly. And this, like Hedgy like saw through all of it. He was like Dustyesky's man from underground. I mean, there's a sense that he saw the darkness of the world and persevered. So like, and there's also a famous Russian cartoon, \\\"Hedgehog in the Fog\\\" that I grew up with, I connected with. [Lex laughing] People who know of that cartoon, you could see it on YouTube, it's. - \\\"Hedgehog in the Fog.\\\" - Yeah. [Lex laughing] It's just, as you would expect, especially from like early Soviet cartoons. It's a hedgehog, like sad, walking through the fog, exploring like loneliness and sadness. It's like, but it's beautiful. It's like a piece of art, people should, even if you don't speak Russian, you'll see, you'll understand. - Oh, the moment you said that I was going to ask, so it's in Russian? But of course it's in- - It's in Russian, but it's more, it's very little speaking in it. It's almost a, there's an interesting exploration of how you make sense of the world when you see it only vaguely through the fog. So he's trying to understand the world. - We have Mickey Mouse, we have Bugs Bunny. We have all these crazy animals, and you have the \\\"Hedgehog in the Fog.\\\" - So there's a certain period, and this is again, I don't know what it's attributed to, but it was really powerful, which there's a period in Soviet history, I think probably '70s and '80s where like, especially kids were treated very seriously. Like they were treated like they're able to deal with the weightiness of life. And that was reflected in the cartoons. And there was, it was allowed to have like really artistic content, not like dumb cartoons that are trying to get you to like smile and run around, but like create art. Like stuff that, you know how like short cartoons or short films can win Oscars, like that's what they're swinging for. - So what strikes me about this is a little bit how we were talking about the suit earlier, it's almost like they treat kids with respect. - Yeah. - Like that they have an intelligence and they honor that intelligence. - Yeah, they're really just adult in a small body. Like you want to protect them from the true cruelty of the world. - Sure. - But in terms of their intellectual capacity or like philosophical capacity, they are right there with you. And so that the cartoons reflected that, the art that they consumed, education reflected that. So he represents that. I mean, there's a sense of, because it's survived so long and because I don't like stuffed animals, that it's like we've been through all of this together and it's the same, sharing the moments together as the friendship. And there's a sense in which, if all the world turns on you and goes to hell, at least we got each other. And he doesn't die, because he's an inanimate object, so. - Until you animate him. - Until you animate him. And then I probably would want to know what he was thinking about this whole time. He's probably really into Taylor Swift or something like that. And it's like that I wouldn't even want to know anyway. - Well, I now feel a connection to Hedgy, the hedgehog that I certainly didn't have before. And I think that encapsulates the kind of possibility of connection that is possible between human and other object and through robotics certainly. There's a saying that I heard when I was a graduate student that's just been ringing in my mind throughout this conversation in such a, I think appropriate way, which is that, Lex, you are in a minority of one, you are truly extraordinary in your ability to encapsulate so many aspects of science, engineering, public communication, about so many topics, martial arts and the emotional depth that you bring to it. And just the purposefulness, and I think if it's not clear to people, it absolutely should be stated. But I think it's abundantly clear that just the amount of time and thinking that you put into things is, it is the ultimate mark of respect. So, I'm just extraordinarily grateful for your friendship and for this conversation. - I'm proud to be a friend. And I just wished you showed me the same kind of respect by wearing a suit and make your father proud maybe next time. [Andrew laughing] - Next time indeed. Thanks so much my friend. - Thank you.

I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, we are going to discuss the gut and the brain, and we are going to discuss how your gut influences your brain and your brain influences your gut. As many of you probably know, there is a phenomenon called your gut feeling, which tends to be something that you seem to know without really knowing how you know it. That's one version of the gut feeling. The other is that you sense something in your actual gut, in your body, and that somehow drives you to think or feel or act in a particular way, maybe to move towards something or to move away from something. Now, today, we aren't going to focus so much on the psychology of gut feelings but on the biology of gut feelings and how the gut and brain interact. Because indeed your gut is communicating to your brain both directly by way of neurons, nerve cells, and indirectly by changing the chemistry of your body, which permeates up to your brain and impacts various aspects of brain function. But it works in the other direction, too. Your brain is influencing your entire gut. And when I say entire gut, I don't just mean your stomach, I mean, your entire digestive tract. Your brain is impacting things like how quickly your food is digesting, the chemistry of your gut, if you happen to be stressed or not stressed. Whether or not you are under a particular social challenge or whether or not you're particularly happy will in fact adjust the chemistry of your gut and the chemistry of your gut in turn will change the way that your brain works. I'll put all that together for you in the context of what we call the gut microbiome. The gut microbiome are the trillions of little bacteria that live all the way along your digestive tract and that strongly impact the way that your entire body works at the level of metabolism, immune system, and brain function. And of course, we will discuss to tools, things that you can do in order to maintain or improve your gut health. Because as you'll also soon see, gut health is immensely important for all aspects of our wellbeing at the level of our brain, at the level of our body, And there are simple, actionable things that we can all do in order to optimize our gut health in ways that optimize our overall nervous system functioning. So we will be sure to review those today. This episode also serves as a bit of a primer for our guest episode that's coming up next week with Dr. Justin Sonnenburg from Stanford University. Dr. Sonnenburg is a world expert in the gut microbiome and so we will dive really deep into the gut microbiome in all its complexity. We'll make it all very simple for you. We will also talk about actionable tools in that episode. This episode is a standalone episode, so you'll get a lot of information and tools, but if you have the opportunity to see this episode first, I think it will serve as a nice primer for the conversation with Dr. Sonnenburg. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink. I've been using Athletic Greens, which is now called AG1, since 2012 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or twice a day is that it covers all of my foundational vitamin and mineral needs and also because it contains high quality probiotics and prebiotics, which is a topic that we're going to talk a lot about today. With Athletic Greens, I can be sure that I'm getting all the vitamins and minerals that I need. So if I'm missing anything in my diet, I can compensate for that with the Athletic Greens. Plus it has the probiotics and prebiotics that can also compensate for any deficiencies that I might have in creating the right environment for my gut microbiome. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman to claim a special offer. They'll give you five free travel packs, which make it very easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're in the car or on a plane or otherwise on the move, and they'll give year's supply of vitamin D3 K2. While not everyone needs additional vitamin D3, many people do even if they're getting sufficient sunlight. So you get the year's supply of vitamin D3, and it also has K2 in there. K2 has been shown to be important for various aspects of calcium regulation, cardiovascular health, and so on. Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman to claim this special offer. Today's episode is also brought to us by LMNT. LMNT is an electrolyte drink that contains no sugar. It does however contain sodium, magnesium, and potassium. I've talked about sodium on the podcast before. I think sodium can indeed be problematic for some people with hypertension or pre-hypertension, but for many people, sodium is a great thing. It can increase blood volume in ways that can be helpful to them. It can improve nerve cell function in ways that can be helpful to them, and for me, anytime I'm exercising and sweating a lot, I want to replace my electrolytes and that means replacing sodium for adequate neuron function, muscle function, and so on. LMNT is formulated to help anyone with their electrolyte needs and is perfectly suited for people who are following a ketogenic, low carbohydrate, or paleo diet. LMNT contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio of 1000 milligrams of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium. If you'd like to try LMNT, you can go to drinklmnt.com/huberman to claim a free LMNT sample pack. You only pay the cost of shipping. Again, that's drinklmnt.com/huberman to claim a free sample pack. Today's podcast is also brought to us by InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the things that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be assessed with a quality blood test. And nowadays with the advent of modern DNA tests, you can also get insights into, for instance, what your biological age is and how that compares to your chronological age. Now, one of the major problems with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests out there is that you get numbers back, they'll tell you if those numbers are in range and out of range but they don't tell you anything about what to do with that information. With InsideTracker, they make everything very simple in terms of directing you towards particular protocols. So these could be nutrition protocols, supplementation protocols, or lifestyle behavioral protocols to help you bring those numbers into the ranges that are best for you. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans. That's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off. Okay, let's talk about the gut and the brain and how your gut and your brain communicate in both directions. Because as I mentioned before, your gut is communicating all the time with your brain and your brain is communicating all the time with your gut. And so the two are in this ongoing dance with one another, that ordinarily is below your conscious detection although you're probably familiar with the experience of every once in a while getting a stomach ache or of eating something that doesn't agree with you, or conversely eating something that you find particularly delicious and that sensation or that experience rather being a whole body experience. Your mind is excited about what you're eating or just ate, your gut is excited about what you're eating or just ate, and it seems to be a kind of unified perception of both brain and body. Today, we're going to talk about how that comes about in the negative sense. Like, you know, when you meet someone you really dislike or when you have a stomach ache, and in the positive sense, when you interact with somebody that you really, really like and you'd like to spend more time with them, for instance, or when you eat something that you really, really like and you'd like to spend more time with that food, so to speak. Now, the gut and the brain represent what we call a biological circuit, meaning they include different stations. So station A communicates with station B, which communicates with station C, and so on. And as I mentioned earlier, it is bidirectional. It's a two-way street between gut and brain. I want to make the important point at the outset that when I say the word gut, when I refer to the gut, I am not just referring to the stomach. Most of us think that the gut equates to the stomach because we think of having a gut or not having a gut or having a gut feeling of some sort. But in the context of gut-brain signaling and the related microbiome, the gut includes the entire digestive tract. That's right, from start to finish the entire digestive tract so much so that today we're going to talk about, for instance, the presence of neurons, nerve cells, that reside in your gut that communicate to specific locations in the brain and cause the release of specific neurochemicals, such as the neurochemical dopamine or serotonin, that can motivate you to seek more of a particular food or type of interaction or behavior, or to avoid particular foods, interactions, and behaviors. And some of those neurons, many of those neurons, in fact, reside in your intestines, not in your stomach. They can be in the small intestine or the large intestine. In fact, you actually have taste receptors and neurons located all along your digestive tract. You have neurons that are located all along your digestive tract and they are communicating to your brain to impact what you think, what you feel, and what you do. Okay, so for the gut-brain axis, we need to deal with the brain part and then we need to deal with the gut part. Let's just quickly talk about the brain part because there the word brain is also a bit of a misnomer in that when we say the gut-brain axis, it does include the brain but includes a lot of other things as well. So as many of you probably know by now, if you're listeners of this podcast, and if you don't, that's fine, your nervous system includes your brain and your spinal cord and those together constitute what's called the central nervous system. Your neural retinas, which are lining the back of your eyes and are the light sensing portion of your eyes are also part of your central nervous system. So actually your eyes are part of your brain. They're the only parts of your brain that are outside the cranial vault. So your retinas, your brain proper, and your spinal cord make up the central nervous system. The other parts of your nervous system constitute what's called the peripheral nervous system, which are the components of your nervous system that reside outside the retinas, brain, and spinal cord. Now, this is very important because today we're going to talk a lot about how the gut communicates with the brain. And it does that by way of peripheral nervous system components, meaning nerve cells that reside in the gut and elsewhere in the body that communicate to the brain and cross into the central nervous system to influence what you think and what you feel, okay? So that's the nervous system part of what we call the gut-brain axis, brain, again, just being a shorthand for including all the elements I just described. Gut, as you now know, includes all the elements of the digestive tract. Let's talk about the architecture or the structure of the gut of your digestive system. Now, not surprisingly your digestive system, aka your gut, begins at your mouth and ends at your anus. And all along its length, there are a series of sphincters that cut off certain chambers of the digestive tract from the other chambers. Now, also along this tube that we call the digestive tract, there's great variation in the degree of acidity, or pH as it's sometimes called. That variation in acidity turns out to give rise to different little microenvironments in which particular microbiota, microbacteria, can thrive or fail to thrive. And so the way I'd like you to think about the digestive tract, this gut component of the gut-brain axis, is that it's not just one component. It's not just your stomach with a particular acidity and a bunch of microorganisms that work particularly well to make you feel good and make your digestive pathways work well. It's a series of chambers, little microenvironments, in which particular microbiota thrive and other microbiota do not. And certain behaviors that you undertake and certain experiences that you have will adjust those microenvironments in ways that make particular microbiota, certain bacteria, more likely to thrive and others less likely to thrive. We'll talk about how that was set up for you early in life. Actually from the moment that you came into the world, that microbiome was being established. It was actually strongly impacted depending on whether or not you were born by C-section or by vaginal birth. And it was strongly impacted by who handled you when you came into the world, literally the hands that were on you. How much skin contact you had, whether or not you were a preemie baby or not, whether or not you had pets at home, whether or not you were allowed to play in the dirt, whether or not you were allowed to eat snails or whether or not you were kept in a very antiseptic environment. All of those experiences shaped these little microenvironments and shaped what constitutes best or worst for those microenvironments, okay? So you have this long tube that we call the digestive tract and it's very, very long. In fact, if we were to splay it out, we were to take all the curves and turns out of the intestine, we would find that it is very long. It's approximately nine meters long. Now, the structure of that digestive tract turns out to be very important in terms of gut-brain signaling. Once again, it's a tube and the hollow of that tube is called the lumen, L-U-M-E-N. But the walls of the tube are not necessarily smooth, at least not for significant portions of the digestive tract. For much of the digestive tract, there are bumps and grooves that look very much like the folds in the brain, but these bumps and grooves are made up of other tissues. They're made up of what's called a mucosal lining, so there's a lot of mucus there. And if we were to look really closely, what we'd find is that there are little hairy-like cellular processes that we call microvilli that are able to push things along the digestive tract. The microbiota reside everywhere along the lumen of the digestive tract, starting at the mouth and all the way to the other end. And they reside within those microvilli and they reside within the lumen. And if we were to look really closely at the bumps and grooves along the digestive tract, what we would find is that there are little niches, little areas in which particular things can grow and reside best. Now, that might sound kind of gross, but it actually is a good thing, especially what's growing and residing there are microbacterial organisms that are good for your gut and that signal good things to your brain. And we will talk about what that signaling looks like and how that's done and accomplished in just a few moments. But I want you to get a clear mental picture of your gut, something that we don't often see. And often when we think about the gut, again, we just think about the hollow of the stomach, food going in there, and getting digested, but it's far more complex and actually far more interesting than that. Now, I've been referring to the gut microbiome and to the microbiota and these bacteria. Let me define those terms a little bit more specifically just to avoid any confusion. The microbiota are the actual bacteria. The microbiome is used to refer to the bacteria but also all the genes as bacteria make, because it turns out that they make some important genes that actually impact all of us. You have loads and loads of these little microbiota, these bacteria. In fact, right now you are carrying with you about two to three kilograms, so that's more than six pounds, of these microbiota, these bacteria. And if we were to look at them under a microscope, what we would see is these are relatively simple little organisms. Some remain stationary so they might plop down into the mucosal lining or they might hang out on a particular microvilli or they might be in one of those little niches, and others can move about, but they basically fill the entire lumen. They surround and kind of coat the surface of the microvilli and they're tucked up into any of those little niches that are available to them to tuck into. If you were to take the head of a pin and look at it under the microscope, you could fit many, many hundreds, if not thousands or more of these little microbacteria. And the reason I say many, many thousands or more, I'm giving a kind of broad range there, is that they do vary in size and, again, they vary as to whether or not they can move or they don't move. Now, they're constantly turning over in your gut, meaning they're being born so to speak and they're dying off. And some will stay there for very long periods of time within your gut and others will get excreted. About 60% of your stool, as unpleasant as that might be to think about, is made up of live and dead microbacteria. So you're constantly making and excreting these microbacteria. And which microbacteria you make and how many stay inside your gut and how many leave, meaning how many are excreted, depends a lot on the chemistry of your gut and depends very strongly on the foods that you eat and the foods that you do not eat. Now, just because what we eat strongly influences our microbiome, meaning our microbacteria, does not mean that there are not other influences on what constitutes our microbiome. Our microbiome is also made up by microbacteria that access our digestive tract through our mouth, through breathing, through kissing, and through skin contact. In fact, one of the major determinants of our microbiome is who we interact with and the environment that we happen to be in. And that actually includes whether or not we interact with animals. In a little bit, I'll talk about some data as to whether or not you grew up in a home that had animals, whether or not you grew up in the home, whether or not there was a lot of social contact, meaning skin contact, or whether or not you grew up in a more animal sparse, contact sparse environment and how that shapes your microbiome. But the simple point is that what you eat influences your microbiome, but also what you do, what you think, and what you feel, and many of the low microbacteria that get into your digestive tract do so by way of social interactions. In fact, if you ask a neurobiologist what the role of the microbiome is, they'll tell you almost certainly that it's there to impact brain function. But if you have friends that are microbiologists, such as I do, they'll tell you, well, maybe the brain and nervous system are there to support the microbiome. It's the other way around. You have all these little microorganisms that are taking residence in our body. They don't really know what they're doing as far as we know. We don't know that they have consciousness or they don't. We can't rule that out, but it seems pretty unlikely. Nonetheless, they are taking advantage of the different environments all along your digestive tract. They are taking advantage of the sorts of social interactions, for instance, the people you talk to and that breathe on you, the people that you shake hands with, the people that you kiss or don't kiss, the people that you happen to be romantically involved with or not, your dog, your cat, your lizard, your rat, whatever pet you happen to own is impacting your microbiome. There's absolutely no question about that. So hopefully now you have some sense of the architecture of the digestive pathway and you have some sense of the trillions of little microbacteria that are living all along the different components of that digestive pathway. But what we haven't talked about yet, and what I'd like to talk about now, is what those little microbiota are actually doing in your digestive tract. In addition to just living there for their own intents and purposes, they are contributing, for instance, to your digestion. Many of the genes that those microbiota make are genes that are involved in fermentation and genes that are involved in digestion of particular types of nutrients. And in a little bit, we will talk about how what you eat can actually change the enzymes that those microbiome components make, enzymes largely being things that are responsible for digestion. They catalyze other sorts of cellular events but in the context of the digestive pathway, we're talking about enzymes that help digest your food. So those microbiota are indeed helping you in many ways. And if you lack certain microbiota that can help you digest, it stands to reason that you would have challenges digesting certain types of foods. The other amazing thing that these microbiota do is they change the way that your brain functions by way of metabolizing or facilitating the metabolism of particular neurotransmitters. So one of the ways that having certain microbiota present in your gut can improve your mood or degrade your mood, for instance, is by way of certain microbiota being converted into or facilitating the conversion of chemicals, such as GABA. GABA is what we call an inhibitory neurotransmitter. It's involved in suppressing the action of other neurons. And that might sound like a bad thing, but all types of sedatives, for instance, alcohol, and a lot of neurons that naturally make GABA can help quiet certain circuits in the brain, for instance, circuits responsible for anxiety. In people who have epilepsy, the GABAergic neurons, as they're called, can all often be disrupted in their signaling, meaning they're not cranking out as much GABA and therefore the excitatory neurons, which typically release other molecules like glutamate can engage in what's called runaway excitation and that can give rise to seizures. So the simple message here is that the microbiota by way of making neurochemicals can influence the way that your brain functions. So you want to support those microbiota and we will give you tools to support those microbiota. But the takeaway at this point is that those microbiota are making things locally to help digest food. Other microbiota are helping to make certain neurotransmitters like GABA, and we'll also talk about dopamine and serotonin. And so the very specific microbiota that reside in your gut have a profound influence on many, many biological functions, especially immune system function, brain function, and digestion. So that should give you a fairly complete picture of your gut microbiome. Now I'd like to talk about how your microbiome and your brain communicate, or more accurately, how your microbiome and the rest of your nervous system communicate. Neurons, which simply means nerve cells, are the cells that do most of the heavy lifting in your nervous system. There are of course other cell types that are important. Glial cell, for instance, very, very important cell types. You have endothelial cells, which are responsible for blood flow, pericytes and other types of cells, but the neurons are really doing most of the heavy lifting for most of the things we think about in terms of nervous system function. You have neurons in your gut and that should not surprise you. Neurons reside in your brain, your spinal cord, your eyes, in fact, all over your body, and you've got them on your heart and in your heart, and you've got them in your lungs, and you've got them in your spleen, and they connect to all the different organs and tissues of your body. So that's not surprising that you have neurons in your gut. What is surprising, however, is the presence of particular types of neurons that reside near or in the mucosal lining just next to that lumen of the gut and that are paying attention, and I'll explain what I mean by paying attention, to the components of the gut, both the nutrients and the microbiota, and thereby can send signals up to the brain by way of a long wire that we call an axon, and can communicate what the chemistry and what the nutritional quality and what the other aspects of the environment are at the gut at a given location up to the brain in ways that can influence the brain to, for instance, seek out more of a particular food. Let me give you a sort of action-based picture of this. Let's say like most people, you enjoy sweet foods. I don't particularly enjoy sweet foods but there are a few that I like. I'm a sucker for a really good dark chocolate or really good ice cream or I got this thing for donuts that seems to just not quit although I don't tend to indulge it very often, I do like them. If I eat that particular food, obviously digestion starts in the mouth. There are enzymes there, it gets chewed up, the food goes down into the gut. These neurons are activated, meaning that causes the neurons to be electrically active when particular components, certain nutrients in those foods are present. And for the cell types, or I should say the neuron types that matter here, the nutrients that really trigger their activation are sugar, fatty acids, and amino acids. Now, these particular neurons have the name enteroendocrine cells but more recently they've been defined as neuropod cells. Neuropod cells were discovered by Diego Bohorquez's lab at Duke University. This is a phenomenal set of discoveries made mostly in the last 10 years. These neuropod cells, as I mentioned, are activated by sugar, fatty acids, or amino acids, but have a particularly strong activation to sugars. They do seem to be part of the sweet sensing system. And even though I'm focusing on this particular example, they represent a really nice example of how a particular set of neuro cells in our gut is collecting information about what is there at a particular location in the gut, and sending that information up to our brain. Now, they do that by way of a nerve pathway called the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve is part of the peripheral nervous system. And the vagus nerve is a little bit complex to describe if you're just listening to this. If you are watching this, I'll try and use my hands as a diagram but really the best thing to do if you want really want to learn neuroanatomy is to just imagine it in your mind as best you can and if you can track down a picture of it, terrific, but here's how it works. Neurons have a cell body that we call a soma, that's where all the DNA are contained. That's where a lot of the operating machinery of the cells are contained and a lot of the instructions for that cell of what to be and how to operate are contained. The cell bodies of these neurons or the relevant neurons are actually up near the neck. So you can think of them as a clump of grapes, 'cause cell bodies tend to be round or oval-ish. And then they send a process that we call an axon in one direction out to the gut and they'll send another process up into the brain. And that little cluster near the neck that's relevant here is called the nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E. The nodose ganglion is a little cluster of neurons on either side of the neck. It has a process that goes out to the gut and a process that goes up into the brain. And again, these are just one component of the so-called vagus nerve. The vagus nerve has many, many branches, not just to the gut. There are also branches to the liver, branches to the lungs, branches to the heart, branches to the larynx, and even to the spleen, and other areas of the body that are important. But right now we're just concentrating on the neurons that are in the gut that signal up to the brain. And what the Bohorquez lab has shown is that these neuropod cells are part of network. They're sensing several different nutrients, but in particular, when they sense sugar, they send signals in the form of electrical firing up to the brain in ways that trigger activation of other brain stations that cause you to seek out more of that particular food. Now, this brings us to some classic experiments that at least to me are incredible. And these are highly reproducible findings showing, for instance, that even if you bypass taste by infusing sweet liquid or putting sweet foods into the gut, and people can never taste them with their mouth, people will seek out more of that particular food. And if you give them the option to have a sweet food infused into their gut or a bitter food infused into their gut or a sweet versus sour, or a more sweet versus less sweet food, people have a selective preference for sweet foods even if they can't taste them. Now, this is important to understand in the context of gut-brain signaling because we always think that we like sweet foods because of the way they taste. And indeed that's still true, but much of what we consider the great taste of a sweet food also has to do with a gut sensation that is below our conscious detection. How do we know that? Well, the Bohorquez lab has performed experiments using modern methods and they're classic experiments showing that animals and humans will actively seek out more of a particular sweet food even if it bypasses this taste system. And the reverse is also true. There have been experiments done in animals and in humans that have allowed animals or humans to select and eat sweet foods, and indeed that's what they do if they're given the option. And yet to somehow eliminate the activation of these neurons within the gut that can sense sweet foods. Now, there are a couple different ways that those experiments ave been done. In classic experiments that date back to the '80s, this was done by what's called subdiaphragmatic vagotomy. So this means cutting off the branch of the vagus that enervates the gut below the diaphragm so that the other organs can still function because the vagus is very important, but basically cutting off the sweet sensing in the gut, still giving people the opportunity to taste sweet foods with their mouth, and they don't actively seek out quite as much of the sweet food when they don't have this gut sensing mechanism that we now know to be dependent on these neuropod cells. More recent experiments involve selective silencing of these neuropod cells. And there have been a lot of different derivations of this sort of thing, but the takeaway from it is that our experience of and our desire for particular foods has everything to do with how those foods taste. It also has to do, as you probably know, with their texture and the sensation of those foods in our mouth, and even indeed how they go down our throat sometimes can be very pleasing or very unpleasant. And it also has to do with this subconscious processing of taste that occurs in the gut itself. And again, when I say gut, I don't just mean in the stomach. There are actually neurons, neuropod cells, further down your digestive tract which are signaling to your brain about the presence of sweet foods, as well as foods such as amino acid rich foods or foods that are rich in particular types of fatty acids signaling up to your brain and causing you to seek out more of those foods or to consume more of those foods. Now, you're probably asking, what is the signal? How does it actually make me want more of those foods without me realizing it? Well, it does that by adjusting the release of particular neuromodulators. For those of you that are not familiar with neuromodulators, these are similar to neurotransmitters, but they tend to act more broadly. They tend to impact many more neurons all at once and they go by names like dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, epinephrine, and so forth. Sometimes people refer to those as neurotransmitters. Technically they are neuromodulators. I'll refer to them almost always as neuromodulators. The neuropod cells signal by way of a particular branch of the vagus through that nodose ganglion that we talked about before and through a number of different stations in the brain stem, eventually cause the release of the neuromodulator dopamine. Dopamine is often associated with a sense of pleasure and reward but it is more appropriately thought of as a neuromodulator that impacts motivation, craving, and pursuit. It tends to put us into modes of action, not necessarily running and moving through space, although it can do that too, but in the context of feeding, it tends to make us look around more, chew more, reach for things more, and seek out more of whatever it is that's giving us that sensation of delight or satisfaction. And again, that sense of delight and satisfaction, you might experience only consciously as the way that something tastes on your mouth but it actually is caused again by both the sensations in your mouth but also by the activation of these neuropod cells. So this is an incredible system of gut-brain signaling, and it is but one system of gut-brain signaling. It turns out it's the system that we know the most about at this point in time. There are other components of gut-brain signaling that we'll talk about in a moment, for instance, the serotonin system. But in terms of examples of gut-brain signaling for which we know a lot of the individual elements and how they work, I think this neuropod, neuron sensing of sweet foods, fatty acids, and amino acids in the gut and communicating that up to the brain by way of the vagus and causing us to seek out more of the foods that deliver those nutrients is an incredible pathway that really delineates the beauty and the power of this gut-brain axis. Let me talk about timescales. Here I'm talking about a particular type of neuron that is signaling up to the brain using electrical signals to cause us to want to seek out a particular category of foods. That's happening relatively fast compared to the hormone pathways of the gut which also involve neurons. So your gut is also communicating to your brain by way of neurons, nerve cells. But some of those nerve cells also release hormones. And those hormones go by names like CCK, glucagon-like peptide 1, PYY, et cetera. A good example of a hormone pathway, or what's sometimes called a hormone peptide pathway, that is similar to the pathway I've talked about before but a little bit slower is the ghrelin pathway. Ghrelin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N, increases with fasting. So the longer it's been since you've eaten, or if you're just eating very little food compared to your caloric needs, ghrelin levels are going to go up in your bloodstream and they go up because of processes that include processes within the gut and include the nervous system. So it's a slow pathway driving you to seek out food generally. As far as we know, the ghrelin system is not partial to seeking out of sweet foods or fatty foods or so on. Ghrelin increases the longer it's been since you've eaten sufficient calories and it stimulates a feeling of you wanting to seek out food. Well, how does it do that? It does that again by impacting neural circuits within the brain, neural circuits that include what we call the brain stem autonomic center. So it tends to make you feel alert and quite, we say, high levels of autonomic arousal. If you haven't eaten in a while, you might think that you just get really exhausted, right? Because we all hear that food is energy and caloric energy is what we need to burn, but you actually have a lot of energy stored in your body that you would be able to use if you really needed energy. But typically if we haven't eaten in a while, we start to get agitated and we get agitated by way way of release of the neuromodulator epinephrine, which causes us to look around more, move around more, and seek out food. That all occurs in brain stem autonomic centers and in the hypothalamus. We did an entire episode on feeding behavior and metabolism as well and you can find those episodes at hubermanlab.com so I don't want to go into a lot of detail about hypothalamic and brains stem centers. But there's a particular area of the brain called the nucleus of the solitary tract, the NST as it's called, that's very strongly impacted by these circulating hormones and tends to drive us toward feeding behavior. So the important point here is that we have a fast system that is paying attention to the nutrients in our gut or the absence of nutrients in our gut, and stimulating us to seek out food or to stop eating certain foods, and we have a slower hormone-related system that also originates in the gut and impacts the brain. But all of those converge on neural circuits for feeding. The neural circuits for feeding include things like the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, they include a bunch of other neurochemicals, but the point is that you've got a fast route and a slow route to drive you to eat more or eat less, right, to seek out food and consume it or to stop eating, to essentially kickstart the satiety mechanisms as they're called, and those are operating in parallel. It's not like one happens first then stops then the other. They're always operating in parallel. And I bring this up because there's a bigger theme here which we see over and over again in biology, which is the concept of parallel pathways. You've always got multiple accelerators and multiple brakes on a system. It's very, very rare to have just one accelerator and one brake on the system. And this will become important later when we talk about tools for optimizing your gut microbiome for healthy eating and for health healthy digestion and for healthy brain function. I want to take a moment and talk about glucagon-like peptide 1, which is also called GLP-1. GLP-1 is made by neurons in the gut and by neurons in the brain. This is a fairly recent discovery but it's an important one. GLP-1 tends to inhibit feeding and tends to reduce appetite. There are a number of drugs released on the market now, one for instance goes by the name semaglutide, which is essentially an GLP-1 agonist. It causes the release of more GLP-1. It's being used to treat type II diabetes, which is insulin resistant diabetes. This is different than type I diabetes where people don't actually make insulin. It's also being used as a drug to reduce obesity. And it seems pretty effective at least in certain populations. There are certain foods and substances that increase GLP-1. I've talked about a few of these on the podcast. One that I'm a particular fan of for entirely other reasons is yerba mate tea can stimulate the release of GLP-1. In South America, it's often used as an appetite suppressant, probably in large part because of its effect on GLP-1 release, but probably also because it does contain caffeine, which is a bit of a stimulant, which also can be involved in lipolysis, which is the utilization of fat stores for energy and so forth. A brief mention about yerba mate. There are some reports out there that yerba mate can increase certain types of cancers. The data that I've seen on this is that it tends to relate to whether or not those are smoked versions of the yerba mate tea, the amount of consumption, and the debate is still out. So I invite you to look at those papers. You can search for those online. Nonetheless, yerba mate is one source of GLP-1 stimulation. Semaglutide is another source. It also can be stimulated by various foods, nuts, avocados, eggs, and so forth. Certain high fiber complex grains will also stimulate GLP-1. I raise this as not necessarily a route that you want to take in order to reduce food intake. I don't even know that that's your goal. But that GLP-1 is another one of these gut-to-brain signaling mechanisms that adjusts appetite that is dependent on diet, depends on what you eat or drink, and that the GLP-1 pathway does seem particularly sensitive to the constituents of diet. There's at least one quality study I was able to find showing that the ketogenic diet for instance, which almost always involves ingestion of very low levels of carbohydrate can increase GLP-1. Although, as I mentioned before, there are other foods that fall outside the range of what we would consider ketogenic that can also stimulate GLP-1, and as I mentioned, there are prescription drugs, like semaglutide, there are other ones as well now, that stimulate GLP-1. So how does GLP-1 reduce appetite? It does that, in part, by changing the activity of neurons in the hypothalamus, this cluster of neurons just above the roof of our mouth, that themselves make GLP-1 and that cause the activation of motor circuits for reaching, chewing, all the things that we associate with feeding behavior. So I use GLP-1 as an example of a pathway that you might choose to tap into by ingestion of yerba mate or by ingestion of the foods I mentioned, or if it's something that interests you, ketogenic diet. But I also mention it simply because it's another beautiful example of how a hormone pathway can impact the activity of brain circuits that are directly involved in a particular behavior. So yet another example of how gut is communicating to brain in order to change what we think we want or to change what our actual behaviors are. So the next time you find yourself reaching for food, or you find yourself wanting a particular sweet thing or fatty thing or something that contains a lot of amino acids, a protein rich food, keep in mind that that's not just about the taste of the food, and it's not even necessarily about the nutrients that you need or don't need. It could be, but it's also about this subconscious signaling that's coming from your body all the time, waves of hormones, waves of nerve cell signals, electrical signals that are changing the way that your brain works. And this raises for me a memory of the episode that I did with Dr. Robert Sapolsky, who's a world expert colleague of mine at Stanford, who is expert on things like hormones and behavior. But we got into the topic of free will, which is a bit of a barbed wire topic as many of you know. It gets into the realm of philosophy, et cetera. And we were kind of batting back and forth the idea, I was saying, \\\"Well, I think there's free will, and can't there certainly be free will or certainly the idea that we can avoid certain choices?\\\" And Robert was saying, \\\"No.\\\" In fact, he said, \\\"Nah,\\\" he doesn't believe that we have any free will. He thinks that events in our brain are determined by biological events that are below our conscious detection and that occur seconds to milliseconds before we make decisions or assessments and, therefore, we just can't control what we do, what we think, and what we feel. And at the time I sort of didn't buy it. I thought, I don't know. I just, I guess I really wanted to believe in free will. And to some extent I still do but as we talk about how these neurons in our gut and these hormones in our gut are influencing our brain and the decisions that we are making, at the level of circuits, like the hypothalamus and the nucleus of the solitary tract, these are areas of the brain way below our frontal cortex and our conscious perception. Think these are examples that really fall in favor of what Dr. Sapolsky was arguing, which is that events that are happening within our body are actually changing the way our brain works. So we might think that we want the cupcake. We might think that we don't need to eat something or do need to eat something and that is entirely on the basis of prior knowledge and decision-making that we're making with our head, but in fact, it's very clear to me based on the work from the Bohorquez lab, classic work over the years dating back to the '80s, and indeed back to the '50s that we'll talk about in a moment, that our body is shaping the decisions that our brain is making and we're not aware of it at all. Now, the good news is that whether or not you believe in free will or not, the simple knowledge that this whole process is happening can perhaps be a benefit to you. You can perhaps leverage it to get some insight and understanding and perhaps even a wedge into your own behavior. You might think, ah, I think I want that particular food, or I think I want to avoid that particular food, but actually that's not a decision that I'm making on a purely rational basis. Has a lot to do with what my gut is telling my brain. So we've largely been talking about chemical communication between the gut and the brain. Chemical because even though these neuropod cells are communicating with the brain by way of electrical activity, what we call action potentials, and in neural language we call those spikes, spikes of action potentials, spikes of action potentials, meaning those neural signals, cause the release of chemicals in the brain like dopamine. So it's chemical transmission. Similarly, hormones, even though they act more slowly, hormones like neuropeptide Y like CCK, like ghrelin, they are signaling chemically. They're moving through the body, they're going in there affecting the chemical output of different cells, and they're changing the chemistry of those cells and the chemistry of the cells that those cells talk to. So that gives us one particular category of signaling from gut to brain, which is chemical signaling. But of course there are other forms of signals and those fall under the category of mechanical signaling. You're probably familiar with this. If you've ever eaten a very large meal or consumed a lot of fluid, you experience that as distension of the gut and that doesn't just have to be distension of the stomach, but distension of your intestines as well. That distension is registered by neurons that reside in your gut, the signals go up to your brain, and communicate with areas of the brain that are responsible for suppressing further consumption of food and/or fluid, and, under certain circumstances, can also be associated with the activation of neural circuits that cause vomiting or the desire to vomit. So if ever you've eaten too much or you've eaten something that doesn't agree with you, that information is communicated by way of mechanosensors that sense the mechanics of your gut, possibly also the chemistry of your gut, but mostly the mechanics of your gut, signal up to the brain, and activate brain centers that are involved in stopping the eating behavior, and activation of an area of the brain stem that is affectionately referred to as the vomit center among neuroanatomists. This is a area that more appropriately is called the chemoreceptor trigger zone, the CTZ, or area postrema and neurons in this area actually will trigger the vomiting reflex. So the way that the gut and the brain communicate is both chemical and mechanical, and it can be both for sake of increasing certain types of behavior. Today, we're talking mainly about feeding behavior up until now anyway but also ceasing to eat, closing your mouth, moving away from food, turning away from food, all behaviors that we're familiar with anytime we feel kind of sick on the basis of activation of this mechanosensor for gastric distress. So we've got chemical signaling and mechanical signaling. And I also want to emphasize that we have direct and indirect signaling from the gut to the brain. Direct signaling is the kind of signaling of the sort I've been talking about mainly up until now, which is neurons in the gut communicating with neurons in the brain stem that communicate with neurons in the hypothalamus. And, of course, those are also going to interact with neurons of the prefrontal cortex which is the area of a brain involved in decision making the, you know, I think it was the shrimp that made me sick. I'm going to, I just don't want any more of that. Or I'm never going back to that restaurant again because after I ate there about an hour later, I started feeling really not well. I felt, you know, kind of feverish, but my gut didn't feel well, my digestion was really off. All of that kind of information is handled in the prefrontal cortex at a conscious level, but the immediate decision to stop eating or to eat more of something to move towards something or away from it, that's made by neural circuits that reside at the, we would say, the subconscious level but what we really mean is below the level of the neocortex. Below the cortex means essentially below our level of conscious awareness. So we talked about two types of information within the gut that are communicated to the brain, chemical information, meaning information about the nutrients that happen to be there, and mechanical information, distention of the gut or lack of distention and so forth. And we talked about how these neuropod cells can signal the release of dopamine and circuits within the brain to cause you to seek out more of something. Now, in a very logically consistent way, dopamine is also involved in the whole business of vomiting. You might think, well, that doesn't make any sense. I thought dopamine was always a good thing. It's involved in moderation and reward, et cetera. But it turns out the area postrema, this vomit center in the brain stem, is chockablock full of dopamine receptors. And if dopamine levels go too high, it can actually trigger vomiting. And this we see in the context of various drugs that are used to treat things like Parkinson's. Parkinson's is a deficiency in dopamine or a lack of dopamine neurons typically that causes a resting tremor, difficulty in movement, because dopamine's also associated with a lot of the neural circuits for movement. Many drugs that are used to treat Parkinson's like L-DOPA increase levels of dopamine so much, or at least activate dopamine receptors to such a great degree in certain areas of the brain that they can cause activation of things like the trigger to vomit. Now, this should also make sense in the natural context of if you gorge yourself with food, gorge yourself with food, gorge yourself with food, the neurons in your gut that respond to that are simply detecting the presence of nutrients but they don't really make decisions themselves. They don't know to stop eating. Your brain knows to stop eating or to eject that food. And so it's a wonderful thing that those neurons are communicating with areas of the brain not just that stimulate consuming more food but that are communicating with areas of the brain, for instance, area postrema, that when dopamine levels get too high, cause us to either stop eating that food or in the case of vomiting to eject that food. So I raise this not to give you a kind of a disgusting counterexample to what we call appetitive behaviors, the things that we like to do more of, but simply to give you a sense of just how strongly even these reflexes that we think of as feeling sick and vomiting or the desire to seek out more food are really being controlled by a kind of push-pull system, by parallel pathways that are arriving from our gut and the same neurochemicals, in this case dopamine, are being used to create two opposite type behaviors, one behavior to consume more, one behavior to get rid of everything you've already consumed. So our brain is actually sensitive to the amount of signaling coming from our gut not just the path by which that signal arrives. Our brain is very carefully paying attention to whether or not the levels of dopamine that are being triggered are within a normal range for typical eating behavior or whether or not we've gorged ourselves to the point where enough already. Now, of course, mechanical signals will also play into area postrema and into the vomiting reflex. If we have a very distended gut, we feel lousy. It just, it actually can hurt very badly, and we will have the desire to vomit, or we will just simply vomit. Mechanical and chemical signals are always arriving in parallel. They never work in unison. And so now we have chemical signals, mechanical signals, and now I'd like to talk about direct and indirect signals because almost everything I've talked about up until now are direct signals, a neural pathway that converges in the brain to create a particular feeling, thought, or behavior, but there are also indirect pathways. And that's what takes us back to the gut microbiome and to these little microbiota. And to just give you the takeaway message at the front here and then I'll give you a little more detail as to how it comes about, you have neurotransmitters in your brain and in your spinal cord and in your eyes and in your peripheral nervous system. They cause the activation or the suppression of nerve activity, meaning they either electrically activate other nerve cells or they cause other nerve cells to be less electrically active. And they do that by way of neurotransmitters. But as it turns out, the gut microbiota are capable of influencing metabolic events and in some cases are capable of synthesizing neurotransmitters themselves. So what that means is that these little bugs, these little microbiota that are cargo in your gut, the six pounds of cargo, they actually can make neurochemicals that can pass into the bloodstream and into your brain and actually impact the other cells of your body and brain indirectly, so without involving these very intricate nerve pathways that we've been talking about. In other words, the foods you eat, the environment of your gut microbiome, can actually create the chemical substrates that allow your brain to feel one way or the other, to feel great or to feel lousy, to seek out more of a particular type of behavior or to avoid that behavior. And that would constitute indirect signaling. So I've been talking a lot about the structure and function of the gut-to-brain pathway, focusing mainly on feeding behaviors and in some cases avoiding feeding or even ejecting food from the digestive tract, I'd like to drill a little bit deeper into this indirect signaling pathway from the gut to the brain because it bridges us nicely from neuronal signals in the gut to the brain, hormonal signals from the gut to the brain, to what also includes the microbiome, which is what we started talking about at the beginning of the episode. As I mentioned a couple of minutes ago, certain gut microbiota can actually synthesize certain neurotransmitters that can go impact the brain. And we actually have some knowledge about which microbiota can synthesize particular neurotransmitters. For instance, the neuromodulator dopamine can be synthesized by or from bacillus and serratia. Now, these are just names of microbiota. I don't expect that any of you would necessarily recognize them. These aren't the sorts of things that you necessarily would run out and buy to get more dopamine. But the point is that particular gut microbiota can create dopamine in our gut that can get into our bloodstream and can generally change our baseline levels of dopamine within the brain and other areas of the body. I mentioned baseline levels of dopamine because as I talked about on an episode all about dopamine but I'll just repeat the basics here now, we have baseline levels of transmitters or neuromodulators that act as sort of the level of the tide, the overall level, and then we can have peaks of dopamine that are created by behaviors or by ingestion of particular foods or drugs, et cetera. So bacillus and serratia tend to increase our baseline levels of dopamine. So if it turns out that we are creating the right gut microbiome environment that these particular gut microbiota can thrive in, well, then our baseline levels of dopamine will be elevated and in general, that leads to enhancement of mood. Similarly, there are other gut microbiota, for instance, candida, streptococus, various enterococcus, these always have these kind of strange and not so attractive names, at least to me as a neurobiologist. Nonetheless, those particular microbiota support the production of or can even be metabolized into serotonin, which is a neuromodulator associated with mood, with social interactions, with a huge number of different types of events and behaviors. Again, these gut microbiota when present and allowed to thrive in our gut will increase our overall levels of serotonin and riding on top of that level of serotonin will be the serotonin that's specifically released in response to certain behaviors. And I really want to drive home this point of baselines and peaks. The baseline level of serotonin might set our overall mood, whether or not we wake up feeling pretty good or really lousy if our serotonin levels happen to be very, very low, whether or not we tend to be in a kind of a calm space or whether or not we tend to be somewhat irritable. But then of course individual events as we go about our day, maybe a compliment that we get or maybe somebody says something irritating to us, whatever it may be will also influence levels of serotonin, but those serotonin events are going to be related to events at particular neural circuits in the brain. And this is an important topic because I think that a lot of people hear quite accurately, oh, 90 to 95% of our serotonin is manufactured in the gut. And indeed that's true. It's manufactured from the sorts of microbiota that I just described. And there are many, many experiments now, mostly in animal models, but also some in humans that show that if the gut microbiome is deficient in some way to these particular bacteria, that serotonin levels drop and people's mood suffers, maybe even their immune system functions, maybe even it exacerbates certain psychiatric illnesses. However, a lot of people take that to mean that the serotonin of the brain all comes from the gut or mostly comes from the gut. That's not the case. It's still the case that you have neurons in the brain that are responsible for releasing serotonin directly in response to certain things like social touch or through other types of positive social experiences. So we've got gut microbiota that can literally be turned into dopamine and raise our baseline levels of dopamine. We've got gut microbiota that can literally raise our baseline levels of serotonin. And indeed there are other gut microbiota like lactobacillus or bifidobacterium, excuse me, hard complex names to pronounce, bifidobacterium that can give rise to increases in GABA levels, this inhibitory neurotransmitter that can act as a little bit of a mild sedative, can reduce irritability, et cetera, but that's just the baseline, the kind of tide of those neuromodulators. Again, I want to emphasize that we still have neurocircuits within the brain and body that are specifically releasing in a very potent way dopamine, serotonin, and GABA. So the two things act in concert. Even though the gut and the brain are acting both in parallel and directly influencing one another, it is a powerful synergistic effect. And there are now hundreds of studies, maybe even thousands by this point, mostly performed in animal models, typically mice, but also some studies in humans that show that creating the correct environment for these gut microbiota to thrive really does enhance mood and wellbeing. And that when our gut microbiome is not healthy, that it really can deplete our mood and sense of wellbeing. Now, there are two major phases to creating a healthy gut microbiome. One you can control and the other one is less under your control. I get into this in a lot of detail in the episode with Dr. Sonnenburg, which is coming out immediately after this one, the following Monday, that is. But for now I want to just capture a few of the main points about the early establishment of the gut microbiome. It turns out that the environment that we are exposed to, the things that come into contact with our skin and digestive tract and any other mucosal lining, even the urethra, the nasal passages, any opening to the outside world that brings in certain, excuse me, certain microbiota in the first three years of life is going to have a profound impact on the overall menu of microbiota that we will be able to carry within our body. And it really does seem that getting exposure to and building a diverse microbiome in those first three years is critical. There's a lot of speculation and some data as to cesarean delivered babies having less diverse microbiomes compared to vaginally delivered babies. There have been attempts, although not conclusive attempts, to link that to the presence of autism spectrum disorders, which at least by some statistics seem to be of higher probability in cesarean deliveries although there are other studies that refute that, and I want to make that clear. However, it's clear that babies do not get much, if any, exposure to microbiota inside of the womb, maybe a little bit, but not much. But that is during the birth process and in the days and weeks immediately after they arrive in the world that their gut microbiome is established, that those gut microbiota take residence within the gut. So it will depend on whether or not they were breastfed or bottle fed. It'll depend on whether or not they were exposed to a household pet or not, whether or not they were held by multiple caregivers or just by one, whether or not they were a preemie baby and were contained in a particularly restrictive environment in order to encourage their further development before they could be brought home or not. I don't want to give the picture that if you were isolated or you were delivered by C-section, that you're somehow doomed to have a poor microbiome. That's simply not the case. However, it is the case that the more diversity of microbiota that one can create early in life is really helpful for long-term outcomes in terms of brain-to-gut signaling, gut-to-brain signaling, and for sake of the immune system. There are some decent studies showing that if children are exposed to a lot of antibiotic treatment early in life, that can be very detrimental to establishment of a healthy gut microbiome. And fortunately that reestablishing a healthy gut microbiome can help rescue some of those deficits. So doctors nowadays are much more cautious about the prescription of antibiotic drugs to children in their early years, not just up to three years, but extending out to five and seven and 10 years. And even in adults, they're very, very careful about that, or they ought to be. One reason is the existence, or I would say, the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria that are becoming more common in hospitals and elsewhere and that can cause serious problems. But in addition to that, because of this understanding that the gut microbiome is influencing and actually creating neurotransmitters that can impact mood and mental health, impact immune health, and so on. As I mentioned earlier, there are hundreds if not thousands of studies emphasizing the key role of the microbiome on brain health, psychiatric health, et cetera. I want to just highlight a few of those studies and in particular, some recent studies that come from labs that have been working on this sort of thing for a very long time. One of the more exciting studies comes from the work of Mauro Costa-Mattioli's lab, which is at Baylor College of Medicine. Mauro's lab has been working on mouse models of autism spectrum disorder for a long time, and looking at social behavior using a mouse model for a long time. And they've been able to identify particular types of microbiota that when they take resonance in the gut can help offset some of the symptoms of autism, at least the symptoms of autism that exist in these mouse models, okay? So again, this is not human work. This is work being done on mouse models for the simple reason that you can do these kinds of manipulations, where basically they took mice that were in germ free-environments or non-germ-free environments, or they exposed mice to particular microbiota and not other microbiota and they discovered that a particular microbiota called L. reuteri, it's L. R-E-U-T-E-R-I. Treatment with L. reuteri corrects the social deficits present in these autism models and it does so by way of activating our old friend the vagus nerve, but not simply because the vagus nerve triggers the release of dopamine, but it turns out that this particular gut microbiota L. reuteri can correct the social deficits in this autism spectrum disorder model. It does that by way of a vagal nerve pathway that stimulates both dopamine release and oxytocin release. And they establish this really mechanistically by showing, for instance, if you get rid of the oxytocin receptor, you don't see this rescue. Now, those are mouse models so we have to take those with the appropriate grain of salt, but they're really exciting. And they come to us in parallel with other studies that are being done, taking the microbiomes of people who have one condition or lack of condition, and putting it into people who have one condition or another condition. Let me explain what I mean by that. The early discovery of the gut microbiome and its potential to impact health was not in the context of the gut-to-brain pathway but rather it was in the context of colitis. This dates back to studies in the '50s, whereby people with very severe intractable colitis for which no other treatment was going to work received fecal transplants. So yes, that's exactly as it sounds. Taking the stool of healthy people who do not have colitis, transplanting those stools into the lower digestive tract of people who do have colitis, and they saw significant improvement, if not rescue of the colitis. That was one of the first indications that something within stool, of all things, could actually rescue another individual from disease, which sounds kind of wild and crazy, and may even sound disgusting to some of you, but as I mentioned at the beginning of the episode, almost 60% of stool is live or dead bacteria, microbiota, and it really opened up this entire field of exploring how different microbiota might have therapeutic effects. And indeed, that has been shown to be the case also in fecal transplants for certain psychiatric illnesses. These are still ongoing studies. They vary in quality. These are hard studies to do for all sorts of reasons, getting the appropriate patient populations, getting agreement, et cetera, making sure that everything's handled properly. But what this involves is fecal transplants from individuals that lack a particular psychiatric condition or metabolic condition into people who have a particular metabolic condition and there has been tremendous success in some cases. One of the more powerful and salient examples is for obesity. There's some people for which even if they ingest very low numbers of calories, even if they go on a liquid protein diet, simply can't lose weight. These are somewhat rare disorders but these are people that would either get gastric bypass surgery. Some people are now getting these fecal transplants from people that have healthy weight and they take the stool from them, they put it into lower digestive tract, and they can see substantial improvement in weight loss in people that were otherwise unable to do that. In some cases, actually they can start eating relatively normal levels of food and still lose weight. So pretty remarkable and that tells us there's something in these microbiota that's really powerful. Now, how those effects are generated isn't clear. One idea is that it's impacting the metabolome, components of the metabolism, almost certainly that's going to be the case. Another idea is that it's impacting neurotransmitters which change behavior and food choices within the brain. Although, as I mentioned, some of these people are already eating very little food to begin with so that's a little bit harder of an argument to create. There are also some somewhat famous examples now of how fecal transplants can lead to negative outcomes. But those negative outcomes further underscore the power of the microbiome in impacting bodily health. One key example of this, for instance, is transfer of fecal matter into another person in order to treat something like colitis and it effectively does that, but if the donor of the stool, of the fecal matter happened to be obese or have some other metabolic syndrome, it's been observed that the recipient can also develop that metabolic syndrome simply by way of receiving that donor's particular microbiota. So these microbiota can create positive outcomes or they can create negative outcomes. Now, most of us of course, are not interested in or pursuing fecal transplants. Most people are interested in just creating a healthy gut microbiome environment for sake of immune system and brain function. And we will talk about how to do that in just a few minutes. But I just want to further underscore the power of the microbiota in shaping brain chemistry and in shaping things like mood or other aspects of mental health that typically we don't associate with our gut. There are several studies published in recent years, one that I'll just highlight now, first author is Tonya Nguyen, N-G-U-Y-E-N. The title of the paper is \\\"Association of Loneliness and Wisdom with Gut Microbial Diversity and Composition, an Exploratory Study\\\". It's an interesting study. Looked at 184 community dwelling adults, excuse me, ranging from 28 to 97 years old. They explored whether or not having enhanced microbial diversity somehow related to these variables that they refer to as loneliness and wisdom. They used a number of different tests to evaluate those. Those are common tests in the psychology literature, not so much in the biology literature, but nonetheless, there are ways of measuring things like loneliness and wisdom, wisdom in this case, being the opposite of loneliness, at least in the context of this study. And what they found was the more microbial diversity, the more diverse one's microbiome was, the lower incidence of loneliness. And they did this by taking fecal samples, profiling them for RNA. So essentially doing gene sequencing of the stool of these individuals, getting ratings of how lonely or not lonely they felt, and correlating those. And that's just but one study. I point it out because it's particularly recent and it looked like it was particularly well done. There is another study that I'll just refer you to. This was a study published in 2020 in \\\"Scientific Reports\\\". The title of the study is \\\"Emotional Wellbeing and Gut Microbiome Profiles by Enterotype\\\". What I particularly like about this study is that they were able to correlate the presence of certain microbiota with feelings of subjective wellbeing and lack of or presence of depressive symptoms. They did high-throughput gene sequencing of the microbiomes of individuals. So that meant measuring the microbiota, figuring out which microbiota were present, how diverse their microbiome was in general. Gut microbiome diversity is a good thing. And then to correlate that with what's called the PANAS score. PANAS stands for positive affect negative affect schedule. This is a test that my lab has used extensively, that other labs to use to evaluate mood and wellbeing. And they defined what were called three enterotypes, three different categories of people that ate very different diets that tended to fall into categories of having more or fewer emotional symptoms that were negative or more fewer emotional symptoms that were positive and whether or not they tend to be more depressed, anxious, or have more stress-related behaviors, et cetera. And what they were able to derive from this study was some strong indications about what types of things we should ingest in our diet, maybe even certain things that we should avoid, but certainly the types of things that we should ingest, that can enhance mood and wellbeing and can tend to shift people away from more depressive-like anxiety and stress-related symptoms. Before we get into what the particular food items were that lend themselves to a healthy microbiome, I want to raise a bigger and perhaps more important issue, which is what is a healthy microbiome. I think if you asked any number of world experts, and I certainly ask this of Dr. Sonnenburg, what is a healthy microbiome, they're all going to tell you it's a microbiome that has a lot of diversity, that includes a lot of different types of bacteria. And that makes sense because it logically would include the bacteria that produce GABA and dopamine and serotonin, and that support the immune system, and do a number of different things. But is it simply the case that adding microbiota diversity is always a good thing? Well, that doesn't seem to be the case. Probiotics and prebiotics, both of which can enhance microbiotal diversity, can improve mood, digestion, immune system, and so on. That's been established but it's mainly been established in the context of post-antibiotic treatment or people that are recovering from illness or people that have been very stressed or have been dealing with all sorts of challenges, mental or physical, and they are an attempt to replenish the gut microbiome. However, it's also clear that excessive microbiota brought about by excessive intake of probiotics can lead to things like brain fog. There's actually some good studies that point to the fact that certain metabolites of the microbiome, certain chemicals produced in the gut and in the body can actually lead to brain fog states. This is thought to come about through the lactate pathways of the gut that can then impact the brain. If you want to look more into this issue of whether or not probiotics taken in excess perhaps can lead to brain fog, I'd encourage you to look at a particular paper. This is a paper published in \\\"Clinical and Translational Gastroenterology\\\". And the title of the paper is \\\"Brain Fogginess, Gas, and Bloating, a Link Between SIBO Probiotics and Metabolic Acidosis\\\". It was published in 2018. We can provide a link to this study. And there are several other studies in the references that point to the fact that in some cases, excessive intake of probiotics and excessive proliferation of gut microbiota can actually be problematic. I mention this not to confuse you but because it is confusing out there. We all would think that just increasing microbiotal diversity is always a good thing but there are thresholds beyond which excessive microbiotal diversity might be problematic. I think everyone agrees that having too few microbial species living in us is not a good idea. Now, none of that answers the questions that I think everyone really wants answers to, which are, what should we do, what should we not do to improve our gut microbiome? I mean, clearly we can't time travel back to when we were zero to three years old and get a dog if we didn't have a dog, get breastfed if we weren't breastfed, be delivered vaginally as opposed to by C-section if we didn't have that opportunity. We just can't time travel and do that. All of us, however, should be seeking to improve the conditions of our gut microbiome because of the critical ways in which it impacts the rest of our brain and bodily health. So what should we do, what shouldn't we do? Clearly we know that stress can negatively impact the gut microbiome. However, some forms of stress that can quote unquote negatively impact the microbiome include fasting, long periods of fasts, which makes sense because a lot of microbiota need food in order to thrive. In fact, many if not all of them do at some point. There are other questions such as should we eat particular foods and how often should we eat those foods? We've all been told that fiber is incredibly important because of the presence of prebiotic fiber, which can essentially feed the microbiome, but is fiber really necessary and how necessary is it to encourage a healthy microbiome? Clearly, there are a number of people following relatively low fiber diets, such as ketogenic diets, and those can have, in some cases, anti-inflammatory effects and can sometimes also improve certain microbiota species. So it can all be rather confusing. And for that matter, I asked our resident expert, Dr. Justin Sonnenburg at Stanford, all of these questions. And he answers them very systematically in the episode that comes out after this one. But I don't want to withhold anything from you so I'll just give a very top contour version of those answers and then you'll get more in-depth answers during that episode. I asked about fasting. And the reason I asked about fasting is that years ago, I was at a meeting as part of the Pew Biomedical Scholars Meeting and one of the other Pew Biomedical Scholars was an expert in gut microbiome and I said, \\\"Hey, are probiotics good for the microbiome? And if so, which ones should I take?\\\" And his answer was very interesting. He said, \\\"You know, in certain cases they can be, especially if you're traveling or you're stressed, but it turns out that the particular bacteria that they put in most probiotics don't actually replenish the microbiota that you need most.\\\" And I thought, \\\"Oh, well, why don't they make ones that replenish the microbiota that you need most?\\\" And his answer was, \\\"Well, they don't replenish those but they replenish other ones that then in turn encourage the development of the microbiota that you do want once you start eating the appropriate foods. So they change the environment which makes the environment better, which indirectly supports the proliferation of quote unquote good microbiota.\\\" Okay, so that was a somewhat convoluted answer but I did appreciate his answer. Then I asked him about fasting. I said, \\\"Well, a lot of people are getting interested in intermittent fasting now. People are spending a significant portion of each 24-hour cycle avoiding food for sake of time restrictive feeding. What does that do to the gut microbiome? Does it make it healthier or does it make it unhealthier?\\\" Well, my colleague from Yale and Dr. Sonnenburg both confirmed that during periods of fasting, especially prolonged periods of fasting, we actually start to digest away much of our digestive tract. Now, the whole thing doesn't start to disappear but there's thinning of the mucosal lining or the least disruption of the mucosal lining. A lot of the microbiota species can start to die off. And so it was surprising to me, but nonetheless interesting that fasting may actually cause a disruption to certain healthy elements of the gut microbiome. But again, there's a caveat. The caveat is that when people eat after a period of fast, there may be a compensatory proliferation, meaning an increase in healthy gut microbiota. So you start to get the picture that fasting is neither good nor bad. You start to get the picture that particular diets, meaning certain restriction diets or macronutrient-rich diets may not be good or bad for the microbiome. And yet there are some answers that arrive to us from Dr. Sonnenburg, but from other experts in the field, that there are certain foods and certain things that we can ingest which definitely enhance the microbiome and make it healthier than it would be were we to not ingest those foods. So next I'd like to talk about what I think is a really pioneering and important study in this area. This is a study that was carried out by the Sonnenburg lab in collaboration with Chris Gardner's lab, also at Stanford, where they compared two general types of diets in humans, diets that were fiber rich, which has been proposed time and time again to enhance microbiota diversity and to enhance gut-brain signaling even and to enhance the immune system perhaps, and diets that were enriched in so-called low-sugar fermented foods. Before I dive into that study and what the conclusions were because they are very interesting and very actionable for all of us, I do want to touch on probiotics because I want to avoid confusion. It is not the case that ingestion of probiotics will always lead to brain fog. I want to make that clear. It is the case that ingestion of probiotics, even if those probiotics don't directly contain the microbiota species that one is trying to proliferate, can be useful for improving microbiotal diversity. In general, it seems that maintaining a healthy gut microbiome involves ingesting certain types of foods, and we'll talk about those in a moment, but perhaps also augmenting the microbiota system through prebiotics or probiotics at a fairly low level on a consistent basis. So these are not high dose probiotics except under conditions of dysbiosis where, for instance, if somebody has done a round of antibiotics and they need to replenish their gut microbiome, there are foods and there are pill form and powder form prebiotics and probiotics that can be very useful. Or in cases where people have been very stressed or are undergoing excessive travel or have shifted their diet radically, maybe that's due to travel, maybe that's due to illness, maybe that's due to stress. But when there are a number of different converging events that are stressing or depleting microbiotal diversity, that's when at least I believe it can be useful to support the gut microbiome through the ingestion of quality probiotics or prebiotics. So it would be under conditions where people are stressed or their system is generally stressed for environmental or illness-related reasons that it might be useful to lean towards higher doses of prebiotics or probiotics than one might normally use but that under normal conditions, that one would focus on quality nutrients through diet and focus on ingestion of probiotics at a fairly low to moderate level, and/or prebiotics at a fairly low to moderate level. That just seems like the logical approach based on the experts that I've spoken to. But certainly if your doctor prescribes or suggests that you take high levels of probiotics for any reason, you should definitely pay attention to your physician, and you should obviously pay attention to your physician in any a case. You should never add or remove anything from your nutritional plan or supplementation plan without consulting a physician. So what should we do in order to maximize the health of our gut-brain axis as it's called? How should we support the diversity of the good microbiota that help us create all these neurotransmitters that we want, improve our immune system function, and so on and so forth? Well, some of that is going to be through the basics. When I say the basics, I mean the foundational things that really set us up for overall health. So this is going to be getting deep sleep of sufficient duration 80 plus percent of the time. I mean, if you could get a hundred percent of the time, that'd be great but very few people accomplish that. It's going to be proper hydration. It's going to be proper social interactions. It's going to be proper nutrition. And we'll talk more about nutrition in a moment. It's going to be limiting excessive, prolonged stressors or stress. And indeed we've done episodes about, just about all of those things but certainly about stress we have an episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast that you can find at hubermanlab.com all about mastering stress, how to avoid long periods of intense stress, what to do to offset those. Given that stress can disrupt the microbiome, whether or not you're fasting or not, those tools ought to be useful. Now, in what I consider to be a landmark study exploring the relationship between the gut microbiome, food intake, and overall health is this paper from Justin Sonnenburg's lab and Chris Gardner's lab, both of which are at Stanford. And the paper entitled \\\"Gut Microbiome-Targeted Diets Modulate Human Immune Status\\\" was published in the journal \\\"Cell\\\", which is among the three top journals perhaps in the world, \\\"Nature\\\", \\\"Science\\\", and \\\"Cell\\\" really being the apex journals for overall science, and especially for biomedical sciences. Now, this is a very interesting study. It was done on humans. There were two major groups. One group of humans was instructed to increase the amount of fiber in their diet and in fact ate a high fiber diet. The other group was instructed to eat a high fermented food diet. Now, both groups started off not having eaten a lot of fiber or a lot of fermented foods and were told to increase the amount of either fiber or fermented foods that they were ingesting over a four-week ramp up period and that was to avoid any major gastric distress. It turns out that if you're not already accustomed to eating a lot of fiber, increasing your amount of fiber dramatically can cause some gastric distress but if you ease into it over time, as we'll see, there's a mechanism behind this, which was unveiled in this study, but if you ease into it over time, then the system can tolerate it. Likewise high fermented foods can be readily tolerated if there's a ramp up phase of ingesting maybe one serving a day, then maybe two servings, and ramping up in this case as high as six servings per day. However, after this ramp up period, the group assigned to the high fiber condition maintained high fiber intake for six weeks and the high fermented food group maintained high fermented food intake for six weeks after which they went off either the high fiber or the high fermented food diet and there was a four-week follow up period during which they gradually returned to baseline. Throughout the study their gut microbiome was evaluated for the diversity of gut microbiota. And there were also a number of measures of immune system function, in particular measures of the so-called inflammatome. The immune system has a lot of different molecules involved. I did a whole episode about the immune system if you're interested in learning what some of those molecules are, various cytokines and signaling molecules that reflect either high inflammation states or reduced inflammation states in the brain and body. You're welcome to check that episode. It's also at hubermanlab.com. Regardless, in this study, they explored the sorts of immune markers that were expressed in either of the two groups and compared those. The basic takeaway of this paper was that contrary to what they predicted, the high fiber diet did not lead to increased microbiota diversity, at least not in all cases. And that was somewhat surprising. You know, the idea is that prebiotic fiber and a lot of the material in fruits and vegetables and grains and so forth are supposed to support microbiotal diversity and the proliferation of existing microbiota. And that is not what they observed, although I want to be very clear in pointing out that the results do not indicate that fiber is not useful for health overall, but it does point to the fact that increasing fiber intake did not increase microbiota diversity, which in general, as I mentioned before, is associated with improvements in microbiota function, health, and overall wellbeing. Now, the high fermented food diet condition was very interesting. It resulted in increased microbiome diversity and decrease inflammatory signals and activity. So there was a twofer. Basically by ingesting high fermented foods in fair abundance, right? You know, four to six servings or more per day is a lot of fermented food intake. We'll talk about what some of those foods were. But the outcome was very positive. There was a clear increase in microbiome diversity and decreased inflammatory signals. So things like interleukin-6, a number of other interleukins and cytokines that are associated with increased inflammation in the brain and body were reduced significantly. Now, let's talk a little bit about this notion of number of servings, et cetera. One somewhat minor point of the study, but I think is useful in terms of taking an actionable stance with this is that the number of servings of fermented foods was not as strong a predictor of improvements in the inflammatome, meaning reduced inflammation and improvements in microbiota diversity, as was the duration of time that the individuals were ingesting fermented foods. In other words, the longer that one is consistently ingesting fermented foods on a daily basis, the better the outcomes in terms of the gut microbiome and for reducing inflammation. So I think that's an important point. And I make that point, especially because for a lot of people, even if you do this ramp up phase, six servings per day of fermented foods can seem like quite a lot. So what are these fermented foods? I think many of us are familiar with certain cheeses and being fermented and beer being fermented and kombucha is fermented. In this study, they focus specifically on low-sugar fermented foods. So this would be plain yogurt, in some cases, kimchi or sauerkraut. An important consideration, however, is that it needs to contain what are called live active cultures, which means there actually have to be microbiota that are alive inside the sauerkraut. One way you know whether or not that's happening is if you purchase sauerkraut or pickles or kimchi from a jar or a container that's on the non-refrigerated shelf or the non-refrigerated section of your grocery store, it is not going to contain live active cultures of microbiota. And likewise, if you consume yogurt that has a lot of sugar or other components added to it, it's not going to have the same positive effect on the microbiome, at least that's the prediction given some of the relationship between the sorts of microbiota that live in sugar versus plain type yogurts. They gave people the option of consuming any number of different low-sugar fermented food. So that again that could be sauerkraut, kimchi, things like kefir, natto. In Japan, they consume natto which is a fermented food. Beer was not one of the fermented foods that was included in the fermented food list. And when we say six servings per day, that is indeed six, six ounce servings, or six, four to six ounce servings. It was not six servings of what's listed on the package. So again, that turns out to be a fair amount of fermented foods. How should you gauge whether or not you're getting enough of this? Well, if you decide to take on this protocol of ingesting more fermented foods, which at least by my read of this study and some of the follow up work that's being done, sounds like a terrific idea if you want to improve your gut microbiome for all the great reasons that one would want to, brain-body health, reduced inflammation, and on and on, well then you definitely want to focus on fermented foods that you enjoy consuming. So for you if that's kefir, or for you that's plain yogurt, or for you that's sauerkraut, which happens to be my personal favorite, then you want to make sure that it's going to be something that you are going to enjoy ingesting quite a lot of and that you're going to be okay with ingesting probably throughout the day. Now, people follow different meal schedules, of course, but this does require not just eating all the fermented foods just before bedtime or at one meal. I suppose you could do that, but in general, it's going to work best in terms of limiting gastric distress by spreading it out throughout the day. I also want to mention brine. Brine is the liquid that surrounds sauerkraut. It's that very salty fluid. And that contains a lot of active live cultures. And they did include or they allowed people to include brine in this study. And in discussions with Dr. Sonnenburg, which we'll go into in more detail on the episode that comes out next week, we talk a lot about the particular value that brine might hold in terms of bringing about microbiota diversity because of the richness of live cultures that it contains. I do want to focus for a moment on the high fiber condition because there were some interesting observations about the people that were placed into that condition. First of all, increasing the amount of fiber definitely increased the number of enzymes that can be used to digest fiber. This is in keeping with this idea of this ramp up phase where accumulation of more fiber intake can over time lead to less gastric distress but also to more utilization of fiber which overall should be a good thing. So while they didn't observe an increase in immune system function or an increase in microbiota diversity, there was an increase in these fiber digesting enzymes. They also observed what they called personalized immune responses. There were some subgroups within the high fiber group that had interesting changes in terms of their reactions to, or I should say their inflammatome, meaning the inflammatory markers they expressed, as well as their microbiota diversity. So there were essentially three groups. One group actually showed an increase in inflammatory markers. So that was quite surprising and probably not wonderful for the message that fiber is always good for us but that was a small cohort within the fiber intake group. Another group and still another group, both showed reductions in baseline microbiota diversity although to varying degrees. So I don't want to paint the picture that fiber is bad but fiber certainly did not have the positive effects on microbiota diversity that the high fermented food diet did. So my read of this study, and I think the stance that many others have taken as a consequence of these data, is that we should be increasing our fermented food intake, that that's simply a good thing to do in order to support our gut microbiome and to reduce inflammatory signals in our brain and body. And there are a number of different ways to do that. I mentioned some of the particular foods. However, anytime you're talking about ingesting fermented foods, especially the high quality ones that come from the refrigerated section of the grocery store, and that have low sugar content, et cetera, we do have to be considerate of cost because certain things like kombuchas, for instance, can be quite costly. I should also mention some kombuchas actually contain alcohol, some do not, or contain very little amounts of alcohol. One way to avoid the high cost of fermented foods while still being able to accumulate a lot of fermented food intake is to simply make those fermented foods yourself. And this is something that we've started exploring and experimenting with in our home. One simple way to do this is to just make your own sauerkraut. It involves very few ingredients. It basically involves cabbage, water, and salt, but there's a specific process that you need to follow in order to create these large volumes of sauerkraut at home using that low cost method. The best resource that I know of in order to follow a great recipe to make homemade sauerkraut would be the recipe for homemade sauerkraut that's contained in Tim Ferriss's book, \\\"The 4-Hour Chef\\\". There's an excellent protocol there. It involves chopping up the cabbage, putting into a bowl, mashing it up with your hands, which can be fun, putting water in there, some salt, covering it, and then keeping it in a particular environment, and then routinely scraping off some of the material from the surface. You have to do that in order to make sure that you're not getting microbes and things growing in it that are bad for you. So you definitely want to pay careful attention to the protocol, but that's a very, very low cost way of generating lots and lots of fermented foods so you don't go broke trying to improve your microbiome. The other thing that you can do if you're really obsessed with kombucha or something like that, to avoid the high cost of kombucha is there are ways that you can get the scoby, which basically allows you to make your own kombucha at home. I've never tried this, but when I was a post doc, there was an undergraduate in the lab, I think, well, I won't out him, but he's now gone on to medical school and I think he's passed his residency and is a practicing doctor, but nonetheless, he was always making kombucha at home. He told me it was exceedingly easy, but then again, he had a number of other skills and attributes that made me think that he could do pretty much anything with ease, whereas I tend to struggle with even basic cooking. So maybe if you're feeling a little more adventurous, you could explore making your own kombucha. But there are a number of different protocols and recipes out there for making your own low-sugar fermented foods. So you needn't run out and buy fresh sauerkraut all the time. I should also mention for those of you that are interested in getting your fermented intake from pickles, jarred pickles rarely if ever contain ferment. Mostly they're just soaked in vinegar, water, and with some spices, but there are some that contain ferment. You actually have to look for that on the container. And I don't know, maybe someone out there knows how to make natto and knows how to make kimchi well and things of that sort. It certainly is the case based on the data from the study that ingesting more servings of fermented food per day ought to be beneficial for our gut microbiome. And since this is an episode not just about gut microbiome but gut-brain health, I should mention that one form of signaling between the gut microbiome and the brain which we did not discuss and I'll just touch on briefly is that when the inflammatome or the genes and markers of inflammation are kept in a healthy range, there's an active signaling of that immune system status to the brain. There's an intermediate cell type that communicates immune status to the brain. And that cell type is the microglial cell. It's a type of glia as the name suggests. When there's a lot of inflammation in the body, these microglia actually get activated and can start eating away at various components of the brain and nervous system. And I don't mean massive eating away. They're not going to digest the whole brain but these microglia are sort of the resident macrophages of the brain. Macrophages are in the periphery and they gobble up debris and things of that sort. The microglia on a regular basis are eating up debris that accumulates across waking cycles and in response to micro-damage to the brain that occurs on a daily basis. So they have a lot of important basic everyday what we call housekeeping functions. But when there's a lot of inflammation in the body, when there's a massive immune response, the microglia can be hyperactivated and that's thought to lead to any number of different cognitive defects or challenges thinking, or maybe even some forms of neurodegeneration over time, although that last point is more of a hypothesis than a well tamped down fact at this point. There's still a lot of investigation to be done in humans. The animal data, however, are very, very strong that when the immune system is activated or chronically activated or hyperactivated that neural tissue, meaning brain tissue and other central nervous system tissue can suffer. So there are a lot of reasons to want to not just improve microbiome diversity, but to also improve immune system function and to limit the number of inflammatory markers that are present in the body because of the way those inflammatory markers can signal deleterious events in the brain. And while eating fermented foods and making your own fermented foods and buying high quality fermented foods might seem like an inconvenience, I would say that from the perspective of cost-benefit or effort-benefit, it's actually quite a good situation where if you can just ramp up the number of fermented foods or servings of fermented foods that you're eating per day over a period of a few weeks so that you're tolerating that well, that ought to have a very positive effect on your microbiome diversity and indeed on gut-brain function. And I'll be the last to suggest that people completely forego on fiber. I think there's some debate out there as to how much fiber we need and whether or not certain forms of fiber are better than others. I'm not going to get into that debate. It's barbed wire enough without me injecting my own views into that debate. But I think there's ample evidence to support the fact that for most people ingesting a fair amount of fiber is going to be a good idea. I would just say that make sure that you're also ingesting a fair amount of fermented foods. And along the lines of fiber, in an accompanying article published in \\\"Cell\\\", which was sort of a what we call a news and views piece about the Sonnenburg and Gardner paper, they make a quite good point, which is that the increase in fiber intake that led to the increase in carbohydrate active enzymes, these CAZymes as they're called, these are enzymes that help digest fiber, quote, \\\"indicating an enhanced capacity for the microbiome to degrade complex carbohydrates present in fibrous foods\\\". So in other words, eating more fiber and fibrous foods allowed for an increase in these enzymes that allow you to eat still more fibrous foods or to better digest fibrous foods that are coming in through other sources. So there is at least one utility for increasing fiber even though it's separate from the gut microbiotal diversity and reducing inflammation. And I'd be remiss if I didn't touch on some of the data and controversy about artificial sweeteners and the gut microbiome. I want to be very clear that what I'm about to tell you has only been established in animal models, in a mouse model, at least to my knowledge. What the studies have shown, and there were several, but one published in the journal \\\"Nature\\\" a few years back is the one that got the most amount of attention is that animals that consume large amounts of artificial sweeteners. in particular things like saccharin or sucralose show disruptions in their gut microbiome. I'm not aware of any studies in humans that show the equivalent effect. And I'm not aware of any studies in humans that show the equivalent effect for things like plant-based, low-calorie sweeteners, things like Stevia, monk fruit, and things of that sort. And at least by my exploration, I couldn't find any data specifically related to the sweetener aspartame. So right now it's somewhat controversial and actually this is kind of a third rail topic out there. When one group will come out saying that artificial sweeteners are bad because they disrupt the gut microbiome, the response generally from a number of people as well, that's only been shown in animal models. And indeed that's true. So right now I don't think that there's a strong case one way or the other. I think that people should basically ask themselves whether or not they like artificial sweeteners or not, whether or not they're willing to risk it or not, and obviously that's an individual choice. I also want to point out a recent study from Diego Bohorquez's lab, which actually shows, however, that neurons in the gut, those neuropod cells, are actually capable of distinguishing between real sugars and artificial sweeteners. This is a really interesting body of work. It was published just now, just recently, I should say, February 2022. The title of the paper is \\\"The Preference for Sugar over Sweetener Depends on a Gut Sensor Cell\\\". And to make a long story short, what they showed was there's a category of neuropod cells that recognize sugar in the gut and signal that information about the presence of sugar in the gut to the brain via the pathways we talked about before, the nodose ganglia, the vagus, dopamine, et cetera, et cetera. Interestingly, the very same category of neurons can respond to artificial sweeteners and signal that information to the brain, but the pattern of signaling and indeed the signature pattern that is conveyed to the brain and received by the brain is actually quite a bit different when these same neurons are responding to artificial sweeteners versus actual sugar. And this is very interesting because what it means is first of all that neurons have incredible specificity in terms of what they are signaling from the gut to the brain. And it also means that there may be a particular signal that the brain receives that says I'm receiving some intake of food or drink that tastes sweet but doesn't actually offer much nutrients in the direction of sweetness, meaning that it doesn't have calories despite being sweet. Now, again, this is all subconscious processing. And like with the previous studies we were just discussing about artificial sweeteners generally and the gut microbiome generally, it's unclear how this relates to humans at this point in time. But given the similarity of cellular processes and molecular processes at the level of gut-brain in mice, I think it stands to reason that these neuropod cells very likely are capable of signaling sweet presence of real sweetener versus artificial sweetener in humans as well, although that still remains to be determined empirically. So I'd like to just briefly recap what I've covered today. I started off by talking about the structure and function of the gut-brain axis. I described the basic structure and function of the digestive pathway, and how that digestive pathway harbors microbiotal species, meaning many, many little bacteria that can signal all sorts of things to the rest of the brain and body. And indeed, we talked about the various ways they do that. We talked about direct pathways, literally nerve networks that extend from the gut up to the brain and from the brain back to the gut. And we talked about indirect pathways, how some of the gut microbiota can actually synthesize neurotransmitters that get out into the bloodstream, can impact the body, can impact the immune system, and can get into the brain and act as neurotransmitters in the brain just as would neurotransmitters that originate from within the brain. We also talked about what constitutes a healthy versus unhealthy microbiome. And it's very clear that having a diverse microbiome is healthier than having a non-diverse microbiome. But as I pointed out, there's still a lot of questions as to exactly what microbiota species you want to enhance and which ones you want to suppress in the gut in order to achieve the best gut-brain axis function. We talked about how things like fasting might impact the microbiome and how some of that might be a little bit counterintuitive based on some of the other positive effects of fasting, or if we're not just discussing fasting, some other types of somewhat restrictive diets either restrictive in time or restrictive in terms of macronutrient intake, how those may or may not improve the health of gut microbiome. And the basic takeaway was that because we don't know exactly how specific diets impact the gut microbiome, and we don't know how fasting either promotes or degrades the microbiome, we really can't say whether or not they are improving or degrading the microbiome at this time. However, it is clear that stress, in particular chronic stress, can disrupt the gut microbiome. It's also clear, of course, that antibiotics can disrupt the gut microbiome. And that brings us to the topic of prebiotics and probiotics. And I emphasized the fact that for most people, ingesting high quality non-processed foods that includes some prebiotic fiber but also that includes some probiotics will probably be healthy but not excessive levels of probiotics. High levels of supplemented probiotics of the sort that would come in a probiotic pill or even prescription probiotics would probably lend themselves best to when people were under severe chronic stress or had just come off a serious round or an ongoing or repeated rounds of antibiotics. That does not mean that ingesting probiotics in any form or any kind is not good. It just means that the very high dose probiotics, again, typically found in prescription form or capsule pill form probably are best reserved to cases where of course your doctor prescribes them. You should always follow your doctor's advice. But in cases where perhaps you are jetlagged, you're traveling excessively for any reason, or working excessively, you're not getting enough sleep, or your diet is radically changed from normal. And we talked about how increasing the amount of fiber in your diet might be useful for increasing fiber digesting enzymes and the assimilation of fibrous foods but that it's really the ingestion of fermented foods and, in fact, getting anywhere from four or even up to six servings a day of fermented foods can be immensely beneficial for reducing inflammatory markers in the body and for improving microbiota diversity all along the gut and thereby improving signaling and outcomes along the gut-brain axis. So we went all the way from structure to function to the four kinds of signaling, mechanical, chemical, indirect, direct, probiotics, fiber, and fermented foods. And I tossed in a little bit at the end there also about ways that you can make your own fermented foods at home in order to try and offset some of the costs. Also, it's just kind of fun to do. And some of those actually taste quite good. I've actually found that the fermented sauerkraut that we're making at home actually rivals the sauerkraut that you can buy out of the refrigerated section at the grocery store. And I am by no means a skilled cook or chef and basically have no culinary skill whatsoever. So if I can do it, you can do it. I hope you found this information useful and perhaps also actionable. One of my motivations for doing this episode was, again, as a primer for the episode with Dr. Justin Sonnenburg where we go really deep into the gut microbiome, less so into the gut-brain axis, but really deep into the gut microbiome, what it is, what it does, what it doesn't do, and some of the emerging findings from his lab that are yet to be published. And I also was excited to do this episode because I think many of us have heard about the gut microbiome. We hear about these bacteria that live in our gut. We hear about the gut-brain axis or that 90% or more of the serotonin that we make is made in our gut. We hear about the gut as a second brain and so forth. But I think for many people, they don't really have a clear picture of what the gut microbiome is and the pathways and mechanisms by which it can signal to the brain and to the other parts of the body. So I hope that today's information at least improved the clarity around that topic and leaves you with a more vivid picture of this incredible system that is our gut-brain axis.

While supplements aren't necessary for everybody, many people derive tremendous benefit from them. One of the key issues with supplements, however, is that the quality of supplements can vary tremendously and oftentimes that relates to the precision, or I should say the lack of precision, with which companies put different amounts of supplements in the capsules and tablets that are listed on the bottle. For that reason, we partner with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E, because Thorne supplements have the highest degree of stringency in terms of the quality of ingredients and the specificity of the amounts of the ingredients. That is, what is listed on the bottle is actually what is contained in the capsules and tablets and powders. If you'd like to see the Thorne supplements that I take, you can go to Thorne, that's thorne.com/u/huberman and there you can see the Thorne supplements that I take. You can get 20% off any of those supplements. And if you navigate deeper into the Thorne site, you can get 20% off any of the other supplements that Thorne makes. That's thorne.com/u/huberman.

(energetic music) I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today's podcast episode is all about sleep, and we're also going to talk about the mirror image of sleep, which is wakefulness. Now, these two phases of our life, sleep and wakefulness, govern everything about our mental and physical health, and we're not just gonna talk about what's useful about sleep, we're also gonna talk about how to get better at sleeping, and that will include how to get better at falling asleep, timing your sleep, and accessing better sleep quality. In doing so, we're also gonna discuss how to get more focused and alert in wakefulness, so because sleep and wakefulness are related, we really can't have a conversation about one without the other. Now, in keeping with this theme, you may catch a few snores in the background. Unlike me, my bulldog, Costello, can fall asleep anywhere, anytime, and he happens to be sleeping over there in the corner, so if you hear snoring, that's what that's about. As always, I wanna just mention that this podcast is part of my effort to bring zero-cost-to-consumer public education about science and science-related tools, it is unrelated to my teaching and research roles at Stanford School of Medicine. Today's podcast is brought to us by Helix mattresses, having the proper sleep environment, both the environment you're sleeping in and the object you're sleeping on, is critically important to getting a good night's sleep. Helix mattresses are a little different than most because they're matched to your specific sleep needs, as well as whether or not you tend to run hot or cold as you sleep through the night, what position you sleep in, and so forth, so if you go to their website, they have a quiz that you can take that matches you to the particular mattress that's gonna be best for your sleep needs. I've always had a lot of trouble sleeping, I'm one of these people that can fall asleep easily, but then I wake up and I have a hard time getting back to sleep, and once I switched to a Helix mattress that was precisely matched to my sleep needs, I found I could sleep through the night, which has made a tremendous difference for me. If you wanna try Helix mattresses, you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman, and that will give you up to $200 off on a mattress order, as well as two pillows free with your mattress order, and of course, having the proper pillows is just as important as having the proper mattress. Today's podcast is also brought to us by Headspace, Headspace is a meditation app that teaches you how to meditate. It's fair to say that now there's a ton of research out there in peer-reviewed journals supporting the fact that mindfulness meditation can support mental and physical health, but many people find it hard to meditate, in fact, I'm one of these people. I started meditating in my teens, but then I would drop it every few weeks or so and then I'd get back to it maybe the following week or every year, I just was not very regular about my meditation practice, and then a few years ago I was flying a lot for work and I was on JetBlue flights, and they have Headspace as part of the choice of things that you can watch on the TV screen, and as I started meditating more regularly, what I found is my sleep was better, I would arrive feeling more rested, it was just a tremendous effects on my work performance and other aspects of my life. If you wanna try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer, if you do that, you'll get one month of all of Headspace's meditations for free, that's the best offer right now, so if interested, go to headspace.com/specialoffer. So let's talk about sleep, sleep is this incredible period of our lives where we are not conscious. We might dream, we might twitch, we might even wake up, but in sleep, we are only in relation to things that are happening within our brain and body. Outside sensory experience, in most cases, can't really impact us, and yet, sleep is this tremendously important period of life because it resets our ability to be focused, alert, and emotionally stable in the wakeful period, so we can't really talk about wakefulness, focus, motivation, mood, wellbeing without thinking about sleep, and that's why we're devoting this entire month to the discussion about sleep. Now, we also can't talk about sleep and think about sleep without thinking about wakefulness because it turns out that the period that we call sleep and the period we call wakefulness are tethered to one another. What we do in the waking state determines when we fall asleep, how quickly we fall asleep, whether or not we stay asleep, and how we feel when we wake up the next day, and today, we're going to talk mostly about how to get better at sleeping, and the reason for starting the conversation that way as opposed to just diving into a lot of biology about sleep, is because first of all, there's a lot of information out there already about the biology of sleep. We're gonna touch on a little bit of this, things like stages of sleep and sleep spindles, melatonin, and dreaming, but I think that by now, most people are aware that getting a really good night's sleep on a consistent basis is critically important, but most people don't know how to do that. In fact, I'm guessing that very few of you out there are consistently getting seven to nine hours of really terrific sleep, waking up feeling rested and like you're ready to attack the day, and being able to go through the day feeling focused and alert without dips in energy or focus, so if you're like most people, which includes me, you have some challenges with sleep at least every third or fifth night or so and maybe even more often, so we're really gonna go tool-heavy today and talk about tools that can help you fall asleep, sleep better, and emerge from sleep feeling more rested, and we're gonna do that by grounding our discussion of tools in peer-reviewed studies, mostly from the last 10 years, although some even more recent than that, and we're gonna start by discussing what is sleep and what governs the timing of the onset of sleep, in other words, what makes you get sleepy at a particular time of day. So what determines how well we sleep and the quality of our wakeful state? Turns out that's governed by two forces, the first force is a chemical force, it's called adenosine. Adenosine is a molecule in our nervous system and body that builds up the longer we are awake, so if you've just slept for 8, or 9, or 10 really deep, restful hours, adenosine is gonna be very low in your brain and body. If, however, you've been awake for 10, 15, or more hours, adenosine levels are going to be much higher. Adenosine creates a sort of sleep drive or a sleep hunger, and actually, hunger is the appropriate word here because for most of what we're gonna discuss today, we can think of it in an analogous way to nutrition. Your nutrition and how well you feel after you eat certain foods, your overall level of fitness and your cellular health and your heart health isn't governed by any one food item that you might eat or not eat, it's governed by a number of different factors, how often you eat, how much you eat, which items you eat, et cetera, and what works best for you. In the same way, your sleep and your wakefulness are the product of kind of the average of a number of different behaviors, how long you've been awake is a key one because of this molecule, adenosine. So the reason you get sleepy when you've been up for a while is because adenosine is creeping up steadily the longer you've been awake, and a good way to remember this and think about adenosine is to think about caffeine. Caffeine, for most people, except a very small percentage of people, wakes them up, it makes them feel more alert, in fact, some people are so sensitive to caffeine that they feel jittery if they drink it even in small amounts, other people can drink large amounts of caffeine and not feel jittery at all. Caffeine acts as an adenosine antagonist, what that means is that when you ingest caffeine, whether or not it's coffee or soda or tea, or in any other form, it binds to the adenosine receptor, it sort of parks there just like a car would park in a given parking slot, and therefore, adenosine can't park in that slot. Now, when caffeine parks in the adenosine receptor slot, nothing really happens downstream of that receptor, the receptor can't engage the normal cellular functions of making that cell and you feel sleepy. So the reason caffeine wakes you up is because it blocks the sleepiness receptor, it blocks the sleepy signal, and this is why when that caffeine wears off, adenosine will bind to that receptor, sometimes with even greater, what we call affinity, and you feel the crash, you feel especially tired. Now, I'm not here to demonize caffeine, I love caffeine, and I drink it in the morning and I drink it in the afternoon, but I'm one of these people that, either because of my tolerance or because of some genetic variations that exist among people in terms of their adenosine receptors, I can drink caffeine as late as 4:00 or 5:00 p.m. in the evening and still fall asleep just fine. Some people can't have any caffeine at all or can't have any caffeine past 11:00 a.m. or else their sleep is totally disrupted. All of this has to do with the relationship between adenosine and these adenosine receptors, genetic variation, things that are very hard to find out except experimentally, meaning each of you needs to decide and figure out for yourselves whether or not you can tolerate caffeine and at what times of day you can tolerate caffeine in order to still fall asleep easily and get good sleep, so rather than demonize caffeine, or say that everyone can drink caffeine until late, you need to figure out what's right for you. Caffeine has a lot of health benefits, it also, for some people, can be problematic for health, it can raise blood pressure, et cetera, caffeine increases this molecule that's a neuromodulator that we call dopamine, we discussed this in episode one, which tends to make us feel good, motivated, and give us energy because, as you may have learned in episode one, dopamine is related to another neuromodulator called epinephrine, which gives us energy, in fact, epinephrine is made from dopamine. So let's just take a step back and think about what we're talking about when we're talking about sleepiness, sleepiness is driven by increases in adenosine that happen naturally, caffeine prevents the adenosine from having its action of making us sleepy by blocking that receptor, so it gives us energy and it increases our dopamine levels, but some people can't tolerate caffeine very well, other people can tolerate it just fine, so you need to determine that experimentally. All the data say there's tremendous variation, and right now, the only way that I'm aware of for you to decide whether or not caffeine is a good or a bad thing for you, and whether or not you should ingest it at a given time of day or at all is really to figure that out on your own, in fact, there's a small subset of people that can drink caffeine until very late and they have no trouble falling asleep because they actually have a mutant form of the adenosine receptor, so in keeping with the theme of science and science-related tools, this is one of those cases where I can't give you a one-size-fits-all prescription except to say you need to experiment with caffeine in a way that's safe for you and explore that and figure out what works for you, and then stick with that. Okay, so adenosine is driving this sleep hunger, when adenosine is low, it's like we're well-fed, we're not very hungry, and when adenosine is high, it's like we're fasted for a long time and we tend to be very hungry, so that when adenosine is high, we really wanna fall asleep. If you want, I'm not suggesting you do this experiment, but you can do it, you can stay up for four more hours than you're used to staying up and you'll find that you're very, very sleepy. That's because adenosine is building up at levels higher and higher because you've been awake for those extra four hours. However, if you've ever pulled an all-nighter, you'll notice something interesting, as morning rolls around, you'll suddenly feel an increase in your energy and alertness again, even though adenosine has been building up for the entire night. Now, why is that? The reason that is is because there's a second force which is governing when you sleep and when you're awake, and that force is a so-called circadian force, circadian means about a day or about 24 hours, and inside all of us is a clock that exists in your brain and my brain, and the brain of every animal that we're aware of, that determines when we want to be sleepy and when we want to be awake. Just think about it, we don't go through the day wanting to fall asleep every 30 minutes and then feeling like we're wide awake, our sleep and our period of sleepiness tends to be condensed into one block, typically one 6- to 10-hour block, although there's also variation in terms of how much people want to sleep, and we're going to discuss how you can diagnose your absolute sleep need as well as how to recover sleep that you've lost. That block of sleep and when it falls within each 24-hour cycle is governed by a number of different things, but the most powerful thing that's governing when you want to be asleep and when you want to be awake is light, and in particular, it's governed by sunlight, and I can't emphasize enough how important and how actionable this relationship is between light and when you want to sleep. It's quite simple on the face of it and it's quite simple to resolve, but people tend to make a big mess of this whole circadian literature, frankly, so let's just break it down from the standpoint of what's going on in your brain and body as you go through one 24-hour day. Let's start with waking, so regardless of how well you slept at night or whether or not you were up all night, most people tend to wake up sometime around when the sun rises, maybe not right at sunrise, but within an hour or two or maybe three of sunrise. Now, I realize there are night-shift workers and there are people traveling and experiencing jet lag where this is not going to be the case, we are gonna deal with jet lag and shift work at the end of this podcast, but for most people, we tend to wake up about the time that the sun is rising or so, and as we do that, adenosine levels tend to be low if we've been asleep for reasons that you now understand, and our system generates an internal signal that is in the form of a hormone. Now, I've talked a lot about neuromodulators and neurotransmitters, I haven't talked a lot about hormones yet on this podcast. The definition of a hormone is it's a substance, a chemical that's released from one organ in your body that goes and acts on other organs elsewhere in your body, including your nervous system. When you wake up in the morning, you wake up because a particular hormone called cortisol is released from your adrenal glands, your adrenal glands sit right above your kidneys, and there's a little pulse of cortisol. There's also a pulse of some, and when I say a pulse, I just mean the release of a little bit, there's also a pulse of epinephrine, which is adrenaline, from your adrenals and also in your brain, and you feel awake. Now, that pulse of cortisol and adrenaline and epinephrine might come from your alarm clock, it might come from you naturally waking up, but it tends to alert your whole system in your body that it's time to increase your heart rate, it's time to start tensing your muscles, it's time to start moving about. It's very important that that cortisol pulse come early in the day, or at least, early in your period of wakefulness, I say that because some people are waking up at 8:00 p.m. and are sleeping all day, but it's very important that that pulse of cortisol occur early in the day and that it happens all at once, it sort of sets a rising tide of cortisol in your system. Now, many of you have probably heard about cortisol in relation to stress, and indeed, as we go through our day and our life, different stressors, different events happen in our life that make us feel more alert. Some of the more stressful ones might be looking at your credit card bill and seeing what seems to be a fraudulent charge, or looking at your phone and suddenly seeing a text that something you thought was gonna happen at a particular time is not gonna happen, or you're running late, those will tend to increase norepinephrine and epinephrine and adrenaline in your system, and if they're severe enough, you'll start getting some pulses of cortisol released from your adrenals throughout the day, but there's this normal, healthy rising tide of cortisol that happens early in the day, and I say healthy because it wakes you up, it makes you feel alert, and it makes you feel able to move and wanting to move and to go about your day for work, for exercise, for school, for social relations, et cetera. So when you wake up in the morning is when that cortisol pulse takes off, and something else important happens, a timer is set in your body and in your nervous system that dictates when a different hormone called melatonin, which makes you sleepy, will be secreted from a particular brain region, so let's talk about that. When you wake up in the morning and you experience that rise in cortisol, there's a timer that starts going, and these are cellular timers and they're dictated by the relation between different organs in your body, that says to your brain and body that in about 12 to 14 hours, a different hormone, this hormone we're calling melatonin, will be released from your pineal gland. So there's two mechanisms here, a wakefulness signal and a sleepiness signal, and the wakefulness signal triggers the onset of the timer for the sleepiness signal. Now, that sleepiness signal that we call melatonin that's released from the pineal comes only from the pineal. Unless you're taking exogenous melatonin, you're supplementing with melatonin, the only source of melatonin in your body is going to be this pineal gland, so let's talk about the pineal gland for a second. The pineal gland is a gland that sits kind of in the little structure near, for the aficionados out there, it's kind of near the fourth ventricle, it's about the size of a pea, Descartes, the philosopher, said that the pineal was the seat of the soul, he said that because it's one of the few structures in the human brain that there's only one of them, you know, most structures, there's one on either side of the brain, so-called bihemispheric, but the pineal, there's only one. I don't know anything about souls, really, certainly not the science of souls, but I think it's very unlikely that the pineal is the seat of the soul, but it is a very interesting organ because it's the only organ in our body that releases melatonin, and that melatonin makes us sleepy and lets us fall asleep. Now, I'm guessing that many of you are probably asking, \\\"Should I take melatonin?\\\" My personal bias on this is, except in rare cases, no, for the following reason, melatonin has a second function, which is that melatonin also suppresses the onset of puberty. In kids, and especially in babies, melatonin isn't just released in the evening 12 to 16 hours after we wake, melatonin is released chronically, or tonically, throughout the day and night, and that chronic or tonic release of melatonin is known to suppress some of the other hormones in other regions of the brain that trigger the onset of puberty. Now, if you or your child has been taking melatonin, don't freak out, as always, any kind of supplement or anything that you're going to take or think about taking, you really need to consult with your doctor, I've said this many times on this podcast and it's in the show notes, et cetera, but before you remove anything or add anything to what you're already doing, please do consult with a healthcare professional. However, melatonin is known to suppress the onset of puberty, so much so that regular, cyclic, cycled periods of melatonin release from the pineal really correlate with the onset of puberty and early adulthood, meaning as we start secreting melatonin only at night, that's also when we tend to transition out of puberty. Now, there are a lot of things that correlate in our nervous system, so that doesn't necessarily mean it controls it, but in this case we know, based on lots of data, endocrinology and so forth, that melatonin suppresses the onset of puberty, so supplementing melatonin could be problematic for that reason, but if you've already gone through puberty, it could also have some impact on other hormone systems in your body, so that's why I personally don't like to use melatonin to fall asleep. There's another reason, which is that melatonin will help you fall asleep but it won't help you stay asleep, and many people who take melatonin find that they wake up three to five hours later unable to fall back asleep. Part of the reason for that might be that melatonin purchased at, you can buy it over the counter in most areas of the world even though it's a hormone, which is a little unusual, you can't just go into a pharmacy, at least in the US, and buy testosterone or cortisol or estrogen, you need a prescription, but you can go buy melatonin for whatever reason, I don't know the reasons for that legality, but it's been shown many times, and now I'm borrowing from some items that were in Matt Walker's book, \\\"Why We Sleep,\\\" where he stated there is evidence that, in commercially available melatonin, the amount of melatonin has been tested for various brands, it can range anywhere from being 15% of what's listed on the bottle, okay, so if they list this as 100 milligrams, it would be a tremendously high dose, it turns out it's only 15 milligrams in that particular pill or capsule, or up to 400 times more than what's listed on the bottle, so it's completely unregulated, and so for those of you taking melatonin, I will discuss at the end of the podcast some other potential alternatives that are probably safer and don't have these issues. So should you take melatonin? My personal bias is no, but for many people, they find that it does help them, and so if you do find it helps you, then just consider what I'm saying in light of the other practices that you're doing and talk to your healthcare professional. Okay, so the rhythm of cortisol and melatonin is what we call endogenous, it's happening in us all the time without any external input, in fact, if we were in complete darkness, living in a cave with no artificial lights whatsoever, or we were in complete brightness where we never experienced any darkness, these rhythms of cortisol and melatonin would continue, you would have a bump in cortisol, or a pulse in cortisol, that would drop off with time, and then melatonin would come up about 12 to 14 hours later, but these endogenous systems of our body, which are both hormonal and neural, were set so that external things could govern when they happen. Now, this takes us back to episode one of the podcast that if you haven't listened to already, you might wanna listen to, where we talked about sensation and perception and all that, I'm not gonna review it again here, but there's one particular sensory event, one particular influence on your nervous system that determines when that cortisol is going to start to rise, so if you were in complete darkness, it would happen once per 24-hour cycle, but it would be somewhat later and later each day, whereas under normal circumstances, what happens is you wake up, and what happens when you wake up? You open your eyes. When your open your eyes, light comes into your eyes. Now, the way this system works is that you have a particular set of neurons in your eye, they're called retinal ganglion cells, you don't have to remember that if you don't want to, but these retinal ganglion cells are brain neurons, again, the retina is just the one piece of your brain, actually, two pieces because most of you have two retinas, that resides outside the skull, per se. When light comes into the eye, there's a particular group of retinal ganglion cells, or type of retinal ganglion cells, that perceives a particular type of light and communicates that to this clock that resides right above the roof of your mouth called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, okay? So I know this can get a little complicated, but these retinal ganglion cells, when you open your eyes, light comes in, and an electrical signal is sent to this central clock we call the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and the suprachiasmatic nucleus has connections with essentially every cell and organ of your body. Now, it's vitally important that we get light communicated to this central clock in order to time the cortisol and melatonin properly, and when I say properly, I can say that with confidence because we know based on a lot of evidence that if you don't get your cortisol and melatonin rhythms right, there are tremendously broad and bad effects on cardiovascular health, dementia, metabolic effects, learning, depression, dementia, in fact, there're so many negative effects associated with getting this wrong that I don't wanna get into it in too much detail, in fact, I feel like we've been bombarded with all this information about how we're not sleeping well, we're not sleeping at the right times, we're not sleeping enough, to the point where people now have sleep anxiety, if they can't sleep well for a night, they're feeling overwhelmed by that and it's sort of now they're stressed about not being able to sleep which is making it harder to sleep, et cetera. I really wanna focus on what we can do to anchor these systems properly, so let's think about what happens when we do this correctly and how to do it correctly. When we wake up, our eyes open, now, if we're in a dark room, there isn't enough light to trigger the correct timing of this cortisol-melatonin thing, these rhythms. You might say, \\\"Well, why won't any light do it?\\\" Well, it turns out that these neurons in our eye that set the circadian clock and then allow our circadian clock to set all the clocks of all the cells and organs and tissues of our body responds best to a particular quality of light and amount of light, and those are the qualities of light and amount of light that come from sunlight, so these neurons, what they're really looking for, although they don't have a mind of their own, is the sun at what we call low solar angle, the eye and the nervous system don't know anything about sunrises or sunsets, it only knows the quality of light that comes in when the sun is low in the sky, the system evolved so that when the sun is low in the sky, there's a particular contrast between yellows and blues that triggers the activation of these cells, so if you wake up and you look at your phone or your computer, or you flip on a bunch of artificial lights, will these cells be activated? And the answer is, sort of, they'll be activated but not in the optimal way. What you want to do is get sunlight in your eyes as close to waking as possible. Now, I wanna be really clear about this because I've talked about it on other podcasts when I was a guest and I talked about it on my Instagram feed, and there seemed to be the same questions coming up again and again, these neurons don't know sunlight, per se, they don't know sunrise or sunset, for that matter, they don't know artificial light from sunlight, what they respond best to, however, is the quality and amount of light that comes in when the sun is low in the sky, that means that if you can watch the sunrise, great, that's perfect for triggering activation of these cells, however, if you wake up a few hours after the sunrise, which I tend to most days, personally, you still wanna get outside and view sunlight, you don't need the sunlight beaming you directly in the eyes, there's a lot of photons, light energy, that's scattered from sunlight at this time, but the key is to get that light energy, from sunlight, ideally, into your eyes. Now, I know many of you are already asking, \\\"Well, I live in Scandinavia,\\\" or, \\\"I can't get sunlight, \\\"there's buildings around me,\\\" et cetera, we will get to all of that, but it's critically important that you get outside to get this light. I had a discussion with a colleague of mine, Dr. Jamie Zeitzer, who's in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford, a world expert in this, and he tells me that it's 50 times less effective to view this sunlight through a window, through a car windshield, or through the side window of a car than it is to just get outside with no sunglasses and view light early in the day. Now, if you can't see the sunrise, like I said, you can see this within an hour or two of sunrise, but it has to be low solar angle, once the sun is overhead, the quality of light shifts so that you miss this opportunity to time the cortisol pulse, and that turns out to be a bad thing to do, you really wanna time that cortisol pulse properly because, we'll get into this a little bit more later, but a late-shifted cortisol pulse, in particular, a 9:00 p.m. or 8:00 p.m. increase in cortisol is one of the consequences, and maybe one of the causes, of a lot of anxiety disorders and depression, so it's kind of a chicken-egg thing, we don't know whether or not it's correlated with, it's the cause, or the effect, but it's a signature of depression and anxiety disorder. Bringing that cortisol pulse earlier in your wakeful period, earlier in your day, has positive benefits ranging from blood pressure to mental health, et cetera, not gonna list them all off because there's just so many of them, but many, many positive things happen when you are getting the cortisol early in the day far away from your melatonin pulse. Okay, so how long should you be outside? Well, this is gonna vary tremendously because some people live in environments where it's very bright, so let's say it's Colorado in the middle of winter, there's a snowfield, there's no cloud cover, and you walk outside, there's going to be so much photon light energy arriving on your retina that it probably only takes 30 to 60 seconds to trigger the central clock and set your cortisol and melatonin rhythms properly and get everything lined up nicely, whereas if you're in Scandinavia in the depths of winter and you wake up at 5:00 a.m. and the sun is just barely creeping across the horizon and then goes back down again a few hours later, you probably are not getting enough sunlight in order to set these rhythms, so many people find that they need to use sunlight simulators in the form of particular lights that were designed to simulate sunlight, however, and I'm not out to attack the companies that produce those, there's another solution to that, you can simply go outside for longer, even if there's a lot of dense cloud cover, you're probably getting anywhere from 10,000 to 50,000 lux, L-U-X, which is just a measure of light energy, and that should be sufficient to set the circadian clock. You could say, \\\"Well, the lights in my house or my phone \\\"are really, really bright, right? \\\"Everyone's telling us to stay off our phones at night \\\"because they're really bright,\\\" but guess what, it turns out that early in the day, your retina is not very sensitive, which means you need a lot of photons, ideally coming from sunlight, to set these clock mechanisms, so looking at your phone or artificial lights is fine if you wake up before sunrise, but it's not going to work to set these clock mechanisms, and this is supported by dozens, if not hundreds, of quality peer-reviewed studies, so you wanna use sunlight, if you can't see sunlight because of your environment, then you are going to have to opt for artificial light, and in that case, you're going to want an artificial light that either simulates sunlight or has a lot of blue light. Now, without going off course here, you might be saying, \\\"Wait, I've heard blue light is bad for me.\\\" Actually, blue light is great for this mechanism during the day, we can talk about blue light and blue blockers, but you really want a lot of blue and yellow light arriving on the retina early in the day. Let me be clear about something, you never ever want to look at any light, sunlight or artificial light, that is painful to look at. If you find that your eyes are watering or you're having challenges maintaining, you know, looking at this thing for a while because it's painful, that light is too bright and you do not wanna damage your retina, so you don't wanna gaze at the sun refusing to blink and burn your retina, that's actually possible to do, you don't wanna do that. You have a proper blink reflex installed in you since birth, and if you feel like something's too bright and you need to blink, it means you need to blink, that it's too much light, so please don't beam your eyes with really bright light, but blue light, in particular, blue light and yellow light coming from sunlight is ideal, if you're going to get it from artificial light because you can't get enough sunlight, well, then, artificial lights that are rich in blue, blue wavelengths, are going to be ideal for setting this mechanism. A lot of people will say, \\\"Oh, I should be \\\"wearing blue blockers throughout the day.\\\" No, that's the exact wrong thing, if you're going to use blue blockers, we can talk about that, that should be reserved for late in the evening because light suppresses melatonin. I've been asked many times before about this pineal gland and there are a lot of ancient practices that map to some of the things that I'm saying, and people will always say, \\\"Oh, I heard that sunlight \\\"is great for the pineal.\\\" Well, perhaps, but we have to careful about that phrase, sunlight inhibits the pineal, it prevents it from releasing melatonin, darkness allows the pineal to release melatonin, so the pineal is not the gland or the organ of sunlight, it is the gland of darkness, in fact, melatonin can be thought of as a sleepiness signal that's correlated with darkness, so get up each morning, try and get outside, I know that can be challenging for people, but anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes of sunlight exposure is going to work well for most people, and you wanna do this on a regular basis and you don't have to do it exactly at sunrise, I realize I'm repeating myself, but somehow, despite barking at people about this for a couple years now, I keep getting the same questions, and somehow, it hasn't been sinking in, which could be related to some circadian disorder, I'm just kidding, if it's not sinking in, it's probably that I'm not being effective in communicating the information, but get that bright light early in the day from sunlight, and if you can't get it from sunlight, get it from artificial light. What kinds of artificial lights will work? Well, there are these sunrise simulators, but the ring lights that people use for selfies and this sort of thing, for posting on Instagram, those generate a lot of blue light. If wanna get experimental about this, there's a free app, I have no relationship to the app, but it's a great app called Light Meter that you can use your phone and you can measure the amount of photon energy in your environment, and it's kind of a fun experiment to do, you can go outside in the morning and you'll see that there's 10,000, 20,000 lux, even though it might seem like it's kinda dim or there's tree cover or cloud cover, you go inside and you shine an artificial light at your phone, press the button on Light Meter and you'll find that it's only 500 or 1,000 lux, and you realize that even though it seems really bright, the artificial light is very condensed, whereas the outside light is scattered in the atmosphere, and so you can think that you're not getting much sunlight but you're actually getting much more outside, so get outside, get that sunlight early in the day, and try and do it on a consistent basis. If you can't do it every day or you sleep through this period of the early day, low solar angle, don't worry about it, these systems in the body, these hormone systems and neurotransmitter systems that make you awake at certain periods of the day and sleepy at other times are operating by averaging when you view the brightest light. Now, that can immediately tell us that what most people are doing is terrible, they're waking up and they're looking at their phone, which isn't triggering activation of these cells in the eye and the central circadian clock, then a few hours later, they might get in their car with sunglasses and drive. Now, a note about sunglasses and prescription lenses, absolutely never, ever, ever compromise safety for the sorts of things I'm talking about, so if you need to wear sunglasses for safety reasons, wear them, absolutely, if you wear prescription lenses or contacts, wear them, they won't filter out the wavelengths of light that are necessary for setting these central clocks, so safety first, of course, if you have a retinal degenerative disorder, retinitis pigmentosa, macular degeneration, or glaucoma, or those run in your family, you want to avoid excessively bright light all the time, you wanna be very cautious about that, you're going to wanna get your light exposure through seeing dimmer light, including sunlight, but for longer periods of time, perhaps. You might immediately ask, \\\"What about low-vision or blind people, \\\"how do they set these central clocks?\\\" Well, turns out that low-vision and blind people, most of them, provided they still have eyes, that the eyes weren't removed because of a burn or a tumor or something like that, still maintain these neurons that set the circadian clock, which brings me to a really important point, it's not about seeing and perceiving the sun, this is a subconscious mechanism by which these neurons, which are called melanopsin ganglion cells, these neurons set your central clocks by getting activated by the particular wavelengths of light that are present in the atmosphere, even coming through cloud cover, and you don't need to see or perceive the sun in order to get this mechanism to start. Now, it's such a vitally important mechanism because it dictates how well and what time you will want to fall asleep later in the day, so for those of you that are night owls and you insist that you're a night owl and you have the genetic polymorphism that makes you a night owl, you may very well have that genetic polymorphism, those genes that make you want to stay up late and wake up late, but chances are, about half of you that think that you're night owls are just not getting enough sunlight early in the day. So viewing light early in the day, ideally sunlight, is key for establishing healthy sleep-wake rhythms and for allowing you to fall asleep easily at night. Now, it's not gonna make sure that all that happens every single time, but it is the foundation of proper sleep and what we call circadian health, it governs metabolism and so many other things that are supposed to exist on a regular 24-hour cycle. Some of you, many of you, might be asking, \\\"What else can help set this rhythm?\\\" Well, it turns out that light is what we call the primary zeitgeber, the time giver, but other things can help establish this rhythm of cortisol followed by melatonin 12 to 16 hours later as well. The other things besides light are timing of food intake, timing of exercise, as well as various drugs or chemicals that one might ingest, not illegal drugs, although those will impact circadian mechanisms as well, but the reason we focus so heavily on light is that light is the main way that this central clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, was supposed to be set, and we know that because it's the only direct input to the clock. These neurons in the eye that are also part of the brain that we call melanopsin ganglion cells that, not so incidentally, were discovered by my friend and colleague David Berson at Brown University, and others, Samer Hattar, King-Wai Yau, et cetera, worked out the mechanisms, the molecular mechanisms, but it was really David Berson that discovered these incredibly fascinating, you know, these are cells that aren't important for sight like pattern vision, but are for setting our clocks, David's really credited with making that discovery. Those cells are the main way and the only direct way to set the clock, in fact, it's fair to say that light viewed by these melanopsin cells, in particular, sunlight, is 1,000 to 10,000 times more effective than, say, getting up in darkness and just exercising. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't exercise early in the day in darkness if that's what you like to do, it will have somewhat an effect on raising your wakefulness early in the day and setting these rhythms, and this is because of some other pathways, for the aficionados out there who wanna know more neuroscience, here's how it goes, you've got this clock above the roof of your mouth that churns out this 24-hour rhythm and it's communicated to all the other organs and tissues of your body, but there's another structure, it has a cool name, it's called the intergeniculate leaflet, which sits a few millimeters away in the brain, and it's involved in regulating the clock output through what's called non-photic, non-light-type influences like exercise and feeding, et cetera. So if you are not feeling awake during the day and you're having trouble sleeping, get the sunlight exposure that we just talked about, but in addition to that, if you wanna become an early riser, for instance, and you wanna feel more awake during the early part of the day, by getting that light exposure and exercising early in the day, you will, after two or three days, you will naturally start to wake up earlier in the day, and that's because these clock mechanisms have shifted, it's like setting the clock earlier as opposed to delaying the clock, and that takes us to a somewhat complicated, but very important, aspect to all this, which is, what sets the clock and keeps it anchored? The main thing is that bright light early in the day, the other thing is sunset, when the sun is also at low solar angle, low, close to the horizon, by viewing sunlight at that time of day in the evening, or afternoon, depending on what time of year it is and where you are in the world, these melanopsin cells, these neurons in your eye, signal the central circadian clock that it's the end of the day, and there's a really nice study that was published last year, and I will put links to these references on a website not too long from now, there was a really nice study that showed that viewing sunlight around the time of the sunset, doesn't have to be just crossing the horizon, but circa sunset, within an hour or so of sunset, prevents some of the bad effects of light in preventing melatonin release later that same night, so let me repeat this, viewing light early in the day is key, viewing light later in the day when the sun is setting, or around that time, can help protect these mechanisms, your brain and body, against the negative effects of light later in the day, so let me talk about you would do that, you'd go view the sunset or you would go outside in the late afternoon or evening, again, if you safely can do that with sunglasses off, you will, if you need to wear sunglasses, fine, but it will take probably 100 to 1,000 times longer with dark sunglasses than if you take them off, again, if you wanna do this through a window at work, that's fine, but it'll take 50 times longer, so the best thing to do is just to get outside for a few minutes, anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes, also in the afternoon. Having those two signals arriving to your central clock that your body, your internal world, knows when it's morning and knows when it's evening, is tremendously powerful. Maybe think about it this way, every cell in your body needs glucose and energy, it needs, whether or not it gets that from meats or it gets it from ketones or it gets it from carbohydrates or fruit or vegetables, it doesn't matter, it is eventually converted into a certain form of energy that all your cells use, but you don't take glucose, you don't take bread or a steak or a nice orange and shove it in your ear, you put it in your mouth, it goes into your stomach, it's digested, and then that resource is distributed to all the cells of your body. Every cell in your body needs oxygen, and you don't put a hose you know, through your nostril or through your ear or through some other orifice in your body, you inhale air and it's then distributed via the lungs to the cells in your blood stream, and then it's distributed to all the organs of your body. Every cell and organ in your body needs light information, and the way to get that light information to all those cells, because you have a thick skull and the inside of you is dark inside your skin, there's no sunlight getting in there, is by viewing sunlight with your eyes at the two times of day that I'm referring to, okay? That's the only route. There was a study published in \\\"Science,\\\" an excellent journal, well over 10 years ago, that showed that light shone on the back of the knee could set these circadian rhythms, that study was retracted, and unfortunately, most people don't know that it was retracted, there were some experimental flaws, that people were actually viewing light through their eyes. That study was repeated, turns out, there is no extraocular photo reception in humans. Whatever somebody tells you that light to the skin or light to the wherever is beneficial for your health, we can talk about that, but there's no way that light information is setting your clocks, you need these cells in your eyes to perceive or to see light at the particular times of day that I'm referring to. Some animals, like snakes and other reptiles, actually have a hole in the top of their skull to get light information directly to their pineal to suppress melatonin. We don't have that hole, I mean, most of you don't have holes in your skull. These holes in your skull that we call the sockets for the eyes are actually there primarily to allow light information to this central clock, and then vision and pattern vision and color vision came much later in evolution, we know this on the basis of genetic studies we get to discuss in a future podcast. So get that light information to the cells of your brain and body by viewing sunlight at the two times of day that I referred to. There's always a lot of questions about, \\\"How long, how much, how do I know if I've had enough?\\\" You'll know because your rhythm will start to fall into some degree of normalcy, you'll start to wake up at more or less the same time each day, you'll fall asleep more easily at night, generally, it takes about two or three days for these systems to align, so if you've not been doing these behaviors, it's gonna take a few days, but they can have tremendous benefits, and sometimes rather quickly, on a number of different mental and physical aspects of your health. Now let's talk about the bad effects of light because light is not supposed to arrive in our system at any time, and nowadays, because of screens and artificial light, we have access to light at times of day and night that normally we wouldn't. Now, earlier I said that you need a lot of light, in particular, sunlight, to set these clock mechanisms, that's true, but there's a kind of diabolical feature to the way all of this works, which is the longer you've been awake, the more sensitive your retina and these cells are to light, so that if you've been awake for 10, 12, 14 hours, it becomes very easy for even a small amount of light coming from a screen or from an overhead light to trigger the activation of the clock and make you feel like you wanna stay up later, make it harder to fall asleep, and disrupt your sleep pattern, okay? So the simple way to think about this is you want as much light as is safely possible early in the day, morning and throughout the day, including blue light, so take those blue blockers off during the day unless you have a real issue with screen light sensitivity, and you want as little light coming into your eyes, artificial or sunlight, after, say, 8:00 p.m., and certainly, you do not want to get bright light exposure to your eyes between 11:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m., and here's why, David Berson, who I mentioned before, and another and friend and colleague, Samer Hattar, who's director of the chronobiology unit at the National Institutes of Mental Health published a paper in \\\"Cell,\\\" which is a journal, another excellent journal, very high stringency, showing that light that arrives to the eyes between 11:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m., approximately, suppresses the release of dopamine, this neuromodulator that makes us feel good, and it's sort of an endogenous antidepressant, and can inhibit learning and create all sorts of other detrimental effects, it does this through a mechanism, for those of you that wanna know the neural pathways, that involves light to the eyes that's then signaled to a structure called the habenula, the habenula looks like two little bat ears sitting right in the middle of a structure in your brain called the thalamus, don't worry about these names if you're not interested in this stuff, if you are, these are just avenues to explore, when that habenula gets activated it's actually called the disappointment nucleus because it actually makes us feel less happy and more disappointed, and can lead to certain forms of depression in the wakeful state. Now, if you wake up in the middle of the night and you need to use the bathroom or you're on an all-night flight and you're, you know, need to read or whatever it is, fine, every once in a while, it's not gonna be a problem to get bright light exposure to your eyes in the middle of the night, but if you think about our lifestyle nowadays and being up late looking at phones, even if you dim that screen, you're triggering this activation because your retinal sensitivity and the sensitivity of these neurons has gone up late in the day. Now, I'm not here to dictate what you should or shouldn't do, but for those of you that are experiencing challenges with mood, those of you that have anxiety, learning problems, issues focusing, the questions I usually get are, \\\"How can I focus better?\\\" Well, we will get to that, but one of the best ways you can support your mechanisms for good mood, mental health, learning, focus, metabolism, et cetera, is to take control of this light exposure behavior at night and not get much or any bright light exposure in the middle of the night. Red light won't trigger this pathway, but very few people have the kind of infrared lights that are set up, or floor lights, and that brings me to an important point, which is about the location of light, this hasn't been discussed much out there, I don't think, these cells in our eye, these neurons that signal the central clock, reside mostly, not exclusively, but mostly, in the bottom half of our retina, and because we have a lens in front of our retina, and because of the optics of lenses, that means that these cells are actually viewing our upper visual field, there's an inversion of the visual image, et cetera, you can look that up if you wanna learn more about retinal optics, it's fascinating, but not the topic for today. These cells are in the bottom half of your retina mostly, and so they're viewing the overhead visual space around you. This is probably not coincidental that these cells were essentially designed to detect sunlight, which is overhead, of course, so if you want to avoid improper activation of these neurons, it's better to place lights that you use in the evening low in your physical environment, so on desktops or even the floor, if you wanna go that way, as opposed to overhead lights, so overhead florescent lights would be the worst, that would be the worst case scenario, lights that are overhead that are a little bit softer, of the sort or yellow or reddish tints, would be slightly better, but dim lights that are set low in the room are going to be best because they aren't going to activate these neurons and therefore shift your circadian clock, so that's a goal. Some people, like Samer Hattar that I mentioned earlier, he turns his home basically into a cave in the evenings. Candlelight actually does not trigger activation of these cells, so candlelight and fireplaces and campfires are fine, dim lights, very dim lights are fine, and lights low in the physical environment, of course, the problem with candlelight and fireplaces is the fire hazard, but you're smart people, you know what to do about that. Don't burn down whatever structure you're in, including forests, please. So, keep the lights low in in your environment. What if you wake up in the middle of the night and you find yourself watching TV or on the computer? Well, in that case, you might wanna wear blue blockers, and you certainly would wanna dim the screen, but ideally, you're not doing that, it's remarkable the positive effects of getting that bit of sunlight early in the day, maybe even also around sunset, and avoiding bright lights, and especially overhead bright lights, between about 11:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.. Now, I'm not talking about shift work, I'm realizing that we're probably gonna have to have an entire discussion devoted just to shift workers because there's some good information there about how they can protect themselves against some of the very bad health effects of shift work, of getting light in the middle of the night, but we rely on shift workers and they're super important to culture and society and the economy, so I wanna acknowledge them and let you know that we will do a discussion about shift work and jet lag, but let's talk about what light can do in terms of shifting us in healthy ways. So the way to think about this whole system, again, is you've got adenosine building up depending on how long you've been awake and it's making you sleepy, and then you've got the circadian mechanisms that are timing your wakefulness and timing when you wanna be asleep, mainly through cortisol and melatonin, but there are a bunch of other things that are downstream of cortisol and melatonin, like, we tend to be hungrier during our wakeful period than late at night, some people like to eat late at night, but if you're finding that you can't become a day person or a morning person, shifting your light exposure, exercise, and food intake to the daytime will help. Some people like to stop eating around 6:00 or 8:00 p.m. because of metabolic reasons or they're trying to maintain their weight or lose weight, that's actually not supported so well by the literature, the literature around nutrition essentially says that it's best to restrict your feeding to a certain period of each 24-hour cycle to not be eating around the clock, and whether or not that's 4 hours or 8 hours or 16 hours is a much lengthier discussion than we have time for now, I would refer you to Satchin Panda's book, \\\"The Circadian Code,\\\" which talks all about that, he's an expert, a former colleague of mine from the Salk Institute in San Diego, you can explore intermittent and circadian fasting, so to speak, through Satchin's literature, we'll talk about that, we might even get Satchin in here if we're lucky at some point in the future, but you can actually use light to wake up earlier. Jamie Zeitzer and colleagues did a beautiful study showing that, if you turn on the lights before waking up, so around 45 minutes to an hour before waking up, even if your eyelids are closed, provided you're not under the covers, after doing that for a few days, that increases your total sleep time and shifts forward the time at which you feel sleepy, it makes you want to go to bed earlier each night. Now, in a kind of diabolical way, they did this with teenagers who are notorious for wanting to wake up late and stay up late, and what they found was bright light flashes, just turning on the lights in their environment, overhead lights, because they're trying to activate this system and that's why they're using overhead lights, even through the eyelids, before these kids woke up, then made those kids naturally wanna go to bed earlier and they ended up sleeping longer, so that's something you could try, you could put your lights on a timer to go on early in the day before you wake up, you could open your blinds so that sunlight is coming through, and again, if you curl up under the covers, then it's not gonna reach these neurons, but it's remarkable that light can actually penetrate the eyelids, activate these neurons, and go to the central clock. That study illustrates a really important principle of how you're built, which is, you have the capacity for what are called phase advances and phase delays, and I don't wanna complicate this too much, so the simplest way to think about phase advances and phase delays is that if you see light late in the day, and in particular, in the middle of the night, your brain and body, for reasons that now you understand, will think that that's morning light even though it's not sunlight because you have this heightened sensitivity, and it will phase delay, it will delay your clock, it will essentially make you want to get up later and go to sleep later, so if you get light exposure too late in the evening or in the middle of the night, it's going to make it hard to want to wake up that next morning early and to go to bed early. The opposite is also true, if you wake up early, say, 6:00 a.m. or 7:00 a.m., and get light exposure, or even earlier, 4:00 a.m., and get light exposure, it will phase-advance your clock, okay? It's gonna make your clock think it's earlier and you'll wanna wake up earlier, so the simple way to think about this is if you're having trouble waking up early and feeling alert early in the day, you're going to wanna try and get bright light exposure even before waking up because it will advance your clock, it's sort of like turning the clock forward, whereas if you are having trouble waking up early, you definitely don't want to get too much light exposure or any light exposure to your eyes late in the evening and in the middle of the night because it's just gonna delay your clock more and more, so rather than get into the specifics of everybody's situation because there are many of you out there with different situations and lifestyle requirements, et cetera, the way to think about this is that you have these internal mechanisms of adenosine and circadian clocks, and they're always operating, and what you're trying to do is provide them anchors, you're trying to provide them consistent, powerful anchors so that your cortisol, your melatonin, and then everything that cascades down from that, like your metabolism and your ability to learn and your sense of alertness, your dopamine, your serotonin, all that stuff is timed regularly, one of the reasons why there's so much challenge out there with focus and anxiety and depression, there are a lot of reasons for that, but one of the reasons is that people's internal mechanisms aren't anchored to anything regular. Now, this doesn't require being neurotically attached to getting up at a very specific time, going outside, viewing the sunlight at the same time every day, these systems, again, will average, but if you can provide them consistent light anchors early in the day and in the evening, and avoiding light at night, you will be amazed at the tremendous number of positive effects that can come from that at the level of metabolic factors, hormones, and just general feelings of wellbeing, in fact, most of us are familiar with what it is to not sleep well and all the terrible effects that has, maybe one night you're fine, two nights even, for the new parents out there, I sympathize with you, but most people are not familiar with what it is to sleep really, really well on a consistent basis, and when you start doing that by controlling your sleep environment, right, get the proper sleep surface, get the proper pillow, get the temperature in the room right, get your light exposure right, start timing your exercise at normal periods or times throughout the day and week, it's amazing how many other biological systems just naturally fall in line, and this is why whenever people ask me, \\\"What should I take?\\\" which is one of the most common questions I get, \\\"What supplement should I take? \\\"What drug should I be taking? \\\"What things should I be taking?\\\" The first question I always ask them is, \\\"How's your sleep?\\\" and 90% of the time, they tell me they either have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep or they don't feel rested throughout the day. A brief note about naps, naps, provided that they're less than one ultradian cycle, provided they're 20 minutes or 30 minutes or even an hour, can be very beneficial for a lot of people, you don't have to take them, but many people naturally feel a dip in energy and focus late in the afternoon, in fact, if we were gonna look at wakefulness, what we would find is that you get that morning light exposure, hopefully, your cortisol goes up, people will start feeling awake, and then around two, or three, or four in the afternoon, there's a spike in everything from alertness to ability to learn, some metabolic factors drop, and then it just naturally comes back up, and then it tapers off as the night goes on. So for some of you, naps are great, I love taking naps, some people, they wake up from naps feeling really groggy, that's probably because they're not sleeping as well as they should at night or as long as they should at night, and so they're dropping into REM sleep or deeper forms of sleep in the day time, and then they wake up and they feel kind of disoriented, other people feel great after a nap, so that's another case where, just like with caffeine, so sort of have to evaluate for yourself. As we discuss this, you're probably realizing this is a lot like nutrition where nowadays it's just crazy, I mean, if you go on social media, it's like you've got people who are pushing carnivore, you've got other people who are pushing vegan, other people who are pushing paleo, every variation of every diet, and there's a lot of data to support any and all of those and the arguments go on and on, and there's probably a lot of genetic variation and lifestyle variation that's going to dictate whether or not something is good for you, whether or not you like it, whether or not you'll stick to it. The same thing is true for circadian and sleep and wakefulness behaviors, except the light-viewing behavior that I talked about before, there's no way around that, that's hardwired into our system, the same way we could factually say that everybody needs some nutrition at some level from some source, everybody needs light information arriving in their system in some way at regular intervals, so that's really what this is about. Okay, so naps are gonna be good for some people, not for others, I have a colleague, a very accomplished neuroscientist, who likes to take naps just after lunch, I personally like to take a nap around 3:00 or 4:00 p.m., but there's a practice that I've adopted in the last 5 years that I've found to be immensely beneficial that is sort of like napping but isn't napping, it's a thing that they call yoga nidra, yoga nidra actually means yoga sleep, and it's a sort of meditation that you listen to, there are number of scripts, I've talked about this on podcasts before but I'm going to post a link to the two that I like most, that allows you to consciously bring your entire body and mind into a state of deep relaxation, and sometimes you fall asleep and sometimes you don't, this is done for 10 to 30 or even 60 minutes at a time. The other thing that works really well is meditation, so I'm talking about naps, but I'm also talking about yoga nidra, which is sort of a form of meditation, and then more standard forms of meditation, all three of those do something powerful which is that they bring our mind into a state of less so-called sympathetic nervous system activation, go back and listen to episode one if that doesn't make any sense, which is what governs your alertness, and instead, it activates cells and circuits in your body that promote the parasympathetic nervous system, or the calming system. A lot of people are not good falling asleep because they're not good at calming down, so some people have no trouble falling asleep, but many people have a hard time falling asleep, or at least every once in a while experience challenges falling asleep. I don't have problems falling asleep most nights, but I've noticed that if I'm working very hard or if the world is particularly stressful, my mind gets into a bit of a kind of OCD loop where I tend to ruminate on things, and I'm not even thinking about anything in particular, it's just challenging for me to disengage and fall asleep. Meditation and yoga nidra scripts have been immensely helpful for me in terms of accelerating the transition to sleep, so they involve taking a few minutes, 10 to 30 minutes or so, just like you would for a nap, and just listening to a script, almost passively, and it has you do some particular patterns of breathing and some other kind of body-scan-like things that can really help people learn to relax, not just in that moment, but get better at relaxing and turning off thinking in order to fall asleep when they wanna do that at night. There's another thing that's similar to this, which is certain forms of hypnosis for sleep, for that, I'll just refer you to the website of a colleague and collaborator of mine, David Spiegel, who's our associate chair of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford, he's developed a website, which is reverie, R-E-V-E-R-I-E, health.com, so reveriehealth.com, that has a lot of science-supported, clinically supported hypnosis scripts that essentially take the brain into states of deep relaxation for the sake of rewiring the brain and neuroplasticity, but one of those scripts that's there and is available free is for sleep, and we'll talk more about hypnosis at a later time because it has a ton of other effects that aren't just limited to sleep. So a period of time each day that you devote to getting better at falling and staying asleep is actually a really good practice to adopt. The other thing about these practices like meditation, yoga nidra, and hypnosis, is people would always say to me, \\\"Well, when should I do them?\\\" and I always say, \\\"Well, the best time of day to do it \\\"is when you first wake up in the morning, \\\"provided you've gotten your sunlight already, \\\"anytime you wake up in the middle of the night, \\\"or any time of day.\\\" In other words, they're always good for you because it's a training mechanism by which you self-train your nervous system to go from a state of heightened alertness that you don't want to heightened relaxation that you do want, and so it's really teaching you to hit the brake, and that brings us to an even more important point, perhaps, which is, we've all experienced that we can stay up if we want to, right? If we wanna stay up late on New Year's or we wanna push an all-nighter, some people can do that more easily than others, but we're all capable of doing that, but it's very hard to make ourselves fall asleep, and so there's a sort of asymmetry to the way our autonomic nervous system, which governs this alertness-calmness thing, the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system, there's an asymmetry there where we are more easily able to engage wakefulness and drive wakefulness, we can force ourselves to stay awake, than we are able to force ourselves to fall asleep, and one of the things that I say over and over again, and I'm gonna continue to say over and over again, is it's very hard to control the mind with the mind, when you have trouble falling asleep, you need to look to some mechanism that involves the body, and all the things I described, meditation, hypnosis, yoga nidra, all involve exhale-emphasized breathing, certain ways of lying down and controlling the body, we're gonna get into breathing in real depth at another time, but all of those involve using the body to control the mind rather than trying to, you know, wrestle your mind into a certain pattern of relaxation, so earlier in episode one, I talked about the Mobius strip, this continuous loop that is the brain-body relationship, or the mind-body relationship, and when we're having trouble controlling the mind, I encourage people to look towards the body, look toward sunlight, avoid sunlight and bright light if that happens to be late at night, so there's a theme that's starting to emerge which is, in order to control this thing that we call the nervous system, we have to look back to some of the things we discussed earlier, like sensation, perception, et cetera, but we have to ask, what can we control? Well, I'm talking about controlling light exposure, controlling your breathing and body, I'm not going into details right now but you can see the yoga nidra script or the reveriehealth.com, or Headspace would be a great place to adopt a meditation practice, any of those are really teaching you to use your body to control your mind, and to allow you to explore the mind-body relationship in a way that gives you more control over your mind and the mind-body relationship, okay? So we talked about light, we talked about activity and timing of light, we talked about the usefulness of naps, and these things that I'm calling non-sleep deep rest, which include meditation, yoga nidra, and hypnosis, non-sleep deep rest, or what I, hereafter, we will refer to as NSDR, not to be confused with EMDR, I don't think I've ever heard NSDR, so I'm planting a flag for NSDR, non-sleep deep rest, as a way to reset one's ability to be awake after you emerge from NSDR, so to get some more wakefulness and ability to attend, some emotional stability, reset, as well as make it better and easier to fall asleep when you wanna go to sleep at night. Now, the non-sleep deep rest does have some research to support it, there's a beautiful study done out of a university in Denmark, I will later provide a link to that study, that showed that this meditation and yoga nidra-type meditation allows dopamine and other neuromodulators in an area of the brain called the striatum that's involved in motor planning and motor execution, to reset itself, in other words, this NSDR can reset our ability to engage in the world in a way that's very deliberate, and not to throw in another acronym, but NSDR resets your ability to engage in DPOs, duration, path, and outcome, so now you're probably rolling your eyes like, \\\"Oh my goodness, the number of acronyms,\\\" but just bear with me because NSDR is so powerful, because first of all, it doesn't require that you rig yourself to any device, it doesn't require that you take much time out of your day, it doesn't require that you ingest anything, except air, and it can have so many positive effects right down to the neuromodulator level, so I think in the years to come, my lab's exploring this in a collaboration with David Spiegel's lab, but other labs are looking at this as well, I think NSDR is going to start to play a more prominent role in what we call wellness and health, both mental health and physical health, so I encourage you to explore those practices. Okay, so what about things that we can and maybe should or should not take in order to control and access better sleep and better wakefulness? We've talked about things you can do or not do, we've talked about nutrition and the timing of nutrition, now let's talk about compounds, those could be prescription drugs, those could be supplements, there are a number of different things that will affect your circadian timing and behavior, in fact, almost everything that you could take will affect your circadian timing and behavior, that's right. So years ago when I was in graduate school, I had a professor, unfortunately, he passed away now, but his name was Ted Jones, the late Edward Jones, who was a world-class neuroanatomist, he wrote the book on the thalamus, in fact, it's called \\\"The Thalamus,\\\" and an expert on patterns of activation in the brain during sleep, and I'll never forget that during one of these lectures, someone asked Ted the question, \\\"What is the effect of some drug \\\"on these waves of activity in the thalamus?\\\" or something, and his answer was incredible. Now, he was a pretty gruff guy, and so his answer was delivered in the form of a kind of aggressive direct statement, he said, \\\"A drug is a substance \\\"that when injected into a person, \\\"produces a scientific publication,\\\" and what he was saying is actually quite true, which is that most every compound will have some effect on some aspect of biology, this is why it's hard to sort through everything that's on PubMed, if you put any molecule or compound or drug into PubMed and then you put sleep next to it, or alertness next to it, you're likely to find a paper where there's an effect, but that's not necessarily telling you that that drug is helpful for that, what it's telling you is that anytime you change what you take or you stop taking something, say you're taking sleeping pills, Ambien or whatever it is, and you stop taking them, your sleep behavior will change. Let's stay you take an aspirin and you don't normally take aspirin, you will shift your circadian rhythm, now you might not shift it perceptibly, you might not create problems for yourself, but anytime you ingest a compound at high potency, you're going to provide some shift to your circadian rhythm. Now, that said, there are a couple things that are directly in line with the biology related to falling and staying asleep and directly in line with the biology of wakefulness, there's a whole category of things, like stimulants, cocaine, amphetamine, and prescription stimulants, that are, the prescription ones were designed for the treatment of narcolepsy, so things like modafinil or armodafinil that are designed to created wakefulness, they are all essentially chemical variants of things that increase epinephrine and dopamine. Now, of course, I'm of the standpoint that things like cocaine and amphetamine are just across the board bad, they have so many addictive and terrible effects, in the proper setting prescribed by the proper professional, things like modafinil for narcolepsy might be appropriate, I know that a lot of people out there take Adderall, even though they haven't been prescribed Adderall, in order to increase wakefulness, that is essentially, well, it's illegal for one, but also it's abusing the system in the sense that you're pushing back on the adenosine system slightly differently than you do caffeine, it will make you feel more alert, there tends to be a heavy rebound and they do have an addictive potential, there are also some other effects of those that could be quite bad, so we're gonna explore stimulants in a whole month related to drugs, but there are some supplements and some things that are safer, certainly safer, and that, in cases where you're doing all the right behaviors, you're exercising and eating correctly and you're still having trouble with sleep, that can be beneficial for falling and staying asleep. Now, I wanna be very clear, I am not pushing supplements, I am just pointing you toward some things that have been shown in peer-reviewed studies to have some benefit. The first one is magnesium, there are many forms of magnesium, but certain forms of magnesium can have positive effects on sleepiness and the ability to stay asleep, mainly by way of increasing neurotransmitters like GABA which help turn off the DPO, the kind of thinking about the future, duration-path-outcome analysis, and make one's mind kind of drift in space and time and make it easier to fall asleep, there are a lot of forms of magnesium out there, but in particular is magnesium threonate, T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E, which you have to check to see if this is right for you, check with your doctor, but magnesium threonate is associated with transporters in the body that bring more of it into cells that allow people to feel this kind of drowsiness and help them fall asleep, so I personally, I can only talk about what I personally do, I personally take 3 or 400 milligrams of magnesium threonate about 30 to 60 minutes before sleep, and it helps me fall asleep. The other thing is theanine, T-H-E-A, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine, 100 to 200 milligrams of theanine, for me, also helps me turn off my mind and fall asleep, I take it 30 to 60 minutes throughout the day. Interestingly, theanine is now being introduced to a lot of energy drinks in order to take away the jitters that are associated with drinking too much caffeine or with some other things that are in the energy drinks, energy drinks can be problematic, they can contain a lot of L-taurine, I'll just tell you an anecdote, when I was a postdoc, I was drinking a lot of a particular energy drink, it has a lot of taurine in it, and actually the whites of my eyes, the sclera, as it's called, of my eyes turned beet red, and I went to a friend who's an ophthalmologist, I said, \\\"Look, I'm not a marijuana smoker, \\\"I haven't been hit on the head, \\\"I don't know what's going on,\\\" and he looked and he said, \\\"I think you've got some microvascular damage,\\\" and we walked through what I was taking and doing, and he said, \\\"Oh, it's probably the taurine, \\\"excessive levels of taurine \\\"can create some microvascular damage.\\\" So if you're having microvascular damage in your eye, you probably have microvascular damage deeper in your skull, so I stopped, that's the reason why I don't take energy drinks, so just a consideration, again, I'm not here to tell you what to do or not do, but just wanna arm you with information. The thing about theanine and magnesium is taken together, they do, for some people, they can make them so sleepy and sleep so deeply that they actually have trouble waking up in the morning, so you have to play with these things and titrate them if you decide to use them, again, if you decide to go this route, I would not start by taking supplements, I would start by getting your light-viewing behavior correct, and then think about your nutrition and then think about your activity and then think about whether or not you wanna supplement, we already talked about melatonin earlier. There's another supplement that could be quite useful, which is apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, which is a derivative of chamomile, 50 milligrams of apigenin also can augment or support this kind of creation of a sleepiness to help fall asleep and stay asleep. A note about sleepwalkers and people with very vivid dreams, theanine can often make your dreams very vivid, sleepwalkers should be careful about taking theanine, everyone should be careful about taking anything, and don't take anything without consulting your board-certified M.D. or healthcare professional first, okay? Your health is your responsibility, I am not gonna take responsibility for what you decide to do experimentally in any case, but especially as it relates to supplementation and drugs. As a important point, apigenin is a fairly potent estrogen inhibitor, so women who want to keep their estrogen levels high, or at whatever levels they happen to be at, should probably avoid apigenin altogether, and men, take that into consideration as well, men need estrogen also, you don't wanna completely eliminate your estrogen, that it can create all sorts of bad effects on libido and cognition, et cetera, so apigenin in some people is gonna be a pretty strong estrogen inhibitor, so keep that in mind. There are other things you can take to help you sleep better, those are the legal ones that, at least I'm aware of, have pretty broad safety margins, but again, you need to explore your safety margins with any compound. I think a great website that I can refer you to is examine.com, examine, the word, just as it sounds, .com, is a website, I have no relation to them, but there, you can find links to peer-reviewed studies for any compound or supplement, as well as some important warnings related to the things I discussed, as well as any other thing that you might decide to supplement with or ingest to help improve your sleep. Okay, that was a lot of information about how to get better at sleeping, falling asleep, wakefulness, et cetera. An important feature of this podcast, as you know, is that we dive deep into topics for several episodes at a time, at least a month at a time, so by stopping here, I recognize that there are probably many more questions that you still have, and the great thing about that is that we have another episode coming up soon, I'm going to hold office hours where I'm going to answer your specific questions about episodes one and two, so if you have questions about this episode, you have questions about episode one, write them down, put them in the comments, I'll also do a post on Instagram where you can put them in the comments there, but put them in the comments to this episode as well, please recommend the podcast if you like it, please subscribe to it here on YouTube, please subscribe to it on Apple, we're now on Spotify as well, recommend it to a friend, the community that we're creating here around these topics of sleep and wakefulness and other neuroscience- and health-related themes is best supported by your involvement and your questions, and so I'm going to be reading all of your questions, distilling those into the most commonly asked questions and liked questions, so if you see something below that you are particularly interested in, you don't have to put that question in again, you can just give it a like, the little thumbs-up tab, and if you're listening to this on Spotify or Apple, please go to YouTube, subscribe, and put your question there, or check out the Huberman Lab Instagram and you can put your questions there so that next episode, I can answer those questions and then we can move forward even more deeply into these critical topics around sleep and wakefulness so that you can be armed with all the information and resources that you need. Last but not least, a number of you have very graciously asked how you can support the podcast, the best way to support the podcast is to subscribe on YouTube or one of the other platforms, we are now on Spotify and Apple, and the other way you can really support the podcast is to check out our sponsors, which were discussed at the beginning. So thank you so much for your time and attention, and above all, thank you for your interest in science. (energetic music)\",\n          \"- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. [cheerful music] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, we are discussing aggression. I'm going to explain to you that there are several different types of aggression, for instance, reactive aggression versus proactive aggression. Meaning sometimes people will be aggressive because they feel threatened or they are protecting those that they love, who also feel threatened. There's also proactive aggression where people go out of their way to deliberately try and harm others. And there is indirect aggression, which is aggression, not involving physical violence, for instance, shaming people and things of that sort. It turns out that there are different biological mechanisms underlying each of the different types of aggression. And today I will define those for you. I'll talk about the neural circuits in the brain and body that mediate each of the different kinds of aggression. Talk about some of the hormones and peptides and neurotransmitters involved. I promise to make it all accessible to you, even if you do not have any biology or science background, I will also discuss tools, psychological tools and biological tools that one can use to better control aggression. Now, right here at the outset, I want to acknowledge that any discussion about aggression has to have an element of context within it. To be fair, human beings invest a lot of money, a lot of time, and a lot of energy, and indeed can even derive pleasure from aggression. Later I'll talk about neural circuits in the brain and body that reinforce, in other words, reward through the release of chemicals that make people feel good. Acts of aggression. However, what I'm mainly referring to is the context in which human beings will pay money in order to derive what we call vicarious aggression, put it simply people spend an enormous amount of money and time and energy watching other people engage in, for instance, aggressive sports. And we know that observing your team winning over another team causes the release of neurochemicals in your brain and body that make you feel good. And yes, that can make you feel more aggressive. We also know of course that most governments invest many billions if not trillions of dollars in infrastructure, technologies and human beings in order to engage in aggression if needed, so-called military warfare, et cetera. So today's discussion will include a description of aggression in the pathological sense. We'll actually talk about an explosive aggressive disorder that most of you probably haven't heard of, but is actually far more common than perhaps, you know, we'll talk about the role of things like attention deficit, hyperactivity disorder, and how that can relate to aggression through the relationship between impulsivity and aggression. And we'll talk about verbal aggression, physical aggression, proactive aggression, as mentioned before, and reactive aggression. I'm certain that by the end of the episode, you will come away with a much more thorough understanding of what this thing that we call aggression really is. And when you see it in other people, I think it will make more sense to you. And when you observe it in yourself or the impulse to engage in aggression, verbal, or physical or otherwise, I hope that you'll understand it better as well. And of course, the tools that I will describe should allow you to modulate and control aggressive tendencies or predispositions to aggressiveness and just generally to be able to engage with people in a more adaptive way overall. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink that's designed to meet all your foundational health needs. I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or twice a day is that it covers all of my basic vitamin mineral and probiotic needs. The probiotics are especially important to me. There are now abundant data showing that the gut microbiome, which is basically a community of trillions of little bacteria that live in our guts are beneficial for our immune system, for brain function, for mood and many other aspects of our health. The gut microbiome thrives on probiotics and Athletic Greens contains the proper array of probiotics to optimize the gut microbiome. Athletic Greens also has adaptogens for recovery from physical and mental exertion, digestive enzymes for gut health, vitamin C, zinc, as I mentioned before, all the other vitamins and minerals that you need in order to cover your basic needs each day. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and claim a special offer. That'll give you five free travel packs that make it easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road and a year supply of Vitamin D3K2. There's now a wealth of data showing that vitamin D3 is important for many aspects of our immediate and long term health. Many people, even if they get out in the sunlight are not getting enough Vitamin D3, and the K2 is thought to be beneficial for calcium regulation and a number of other things important to our health. So again, if you go to athleticGreens.com/huberman, you can claim the special offer of the five free travel packs and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2. Today's episode is also brought to us by ROKA. ROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses that are the absolute highest quality. The company was founded by two All-American swimmers from Stanford and everything about their eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind, I've spent a lifetime working on the biology of the visual system, I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with some pretty tough challenges as you move throughout the day. For instance, if you go from a brightly lit region to a dimmer region, your visual system has to adjust. ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with those sorts of adjustments in mind. So for instance, if you're outside in the shade, you move into the sun and then back into the shade, you don't have to take your sunglasses on and off. Their glasses were initially designed for sports performance and the great thing is they could be used for that, but also they have a terrific aesthetic, so you can wear them to work or out to dinner. I wear readers at night and when I drive at night and I wear sunglasses, if I'm out a lot on really bright days. The terrific thing about ROKA glasses is that even if you get sweaty, they won't fall off. So you can run with them, you can cycle with them. Or as I mentioned before, you can just wear them out and about. If you'd like to try ROKA, you can go to roka.com, that's R-O-K-A.com and enter the code \\\"Huberman\\\" to save 20% off your first order. Again, that's ROKA roka.com and enter the code \\\"Huberman\\\" at checkout. Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep. Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows that in my opinion are the very best you'll find. I started sleeping on a Helix mattress a little over a year ago, and it's the best sleep I've had ever since. If you go to the Helix site, they have a terrific sleep quiz that just takes a few minutes, ask you questions like, \\\"Do you tend to sleep on your side, your back or your stomach?\\\" Maybe you don't know because you're asleep, but many people do know. And even if you don't know that's okay, it will also ask you questions like, \\\"Do you tend to run hot or cold?\\\" Do you tend to wake up in the middle of the night or not? And by taking that brief quiz, they will match you to the specific mattress that's ideal for you and your sleep needs. And that's really what sets Helix Sleep mattresses apart. Everybody's unique, and they know that. So if you take this quiz, you'll get matched to a particular mattress. For me, it was the \\\"Dusk\\\" mattress D-U-S-K, but again, that's just me, and you may match to that one, or you may match to a different one. If you're interested in upgrading your mattress and sleeping much better, go to helixsleep.com/huberman. Take that two minute sleep quiz and they'll match you to a customized mattress and you'll get up to $200 off any mattress order and two free pillows. I also love their pillows. I've always had this issue with pillows that they heat up too much. I'm always looking for the pillow that can cool itself. Somehow the pillows stay nice and cool. They're also not too big, so I'm not propped up, not getting the Text Neck in the middle of the night, where I'm letting my chin push my chest, nor am I falling back and having trouble breathing in the middle of the night. They're designed just right. They also have a 10 years warranty and you get to try it out for a hundred nights, risk free. They'll even pick it up for you if you don't love it. But I think that you will. Again, if you're interested, you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman for up to $200 off and two free pillows. Let's talk about aggression. I think that many people out there are put off by aggression, although others are drawn to aggression both in themselves and when observing it in others. The reason to talk about aggression is, that as mentioned before, the context of aggression really matters. So there are instances where aggression is adaptive. For instance, a mother protecting her children if she's being attacked, or if her children are being threatened. I think most people would agree that so-called maternal aggression of that sort, provided the context is right, is a great thing. Protecting our young is after all one of the primary adaptive drives of our species, and thank goodness it is. Of course, other forms of aggression like unprovoked, proactive aggression, somebody simply being violent to somebody else, even when unprovoked, most of us cringe when we see that kind of behavior, it can even evoke aggression in people when they observe that kind of behavior. So again, context really matters, but a more general and perhaps an even more important reason to think about and understand aggression is that by understanding the biology and psychology of aggression, you will be in a much better position to understand how all emotional states come to be, both in yourself and in others. For instance, many of you have probably heard the statement that I believe arises from pop psychology, not from formal academic psychology, that aggression is just sadness. It's a form of sadness that's amplified and it shows up as aggression. But when we look at the underlying biology and the peer reviewed literature on this, nothing could be further from the truth. We have distinct circuits in the brain for aggression versus grief and mourning, those are non-overlapping. Now that doesn't mean that you can't be sad and aggressive or in a state of mourning and aggressive at the same time, but the idea that sadness and aggression are one in the same thing is simply not true. And by understanding that, or perhaps by understanding that irritability and aggression are not the same thing, you'll be in a much better position to apply some of the tools that we will talk about in this episode in order to be able to reduce or eliminate, or if it's adaptive to you to modulate aggression. And yes, there are cases where modulating your aggression in some cases, even amplifying aggression can be adaptive. Now this of course is not the first discussion about the biology of aggression or the psychology of aggression. And we really can look to the beginning of the last century as the time in which the formal study of aggression really began. One of the names that's most associated with the formal study of aggression is none other than Konrad Lorenz. Some of you may be familiar with that name, others of you may not be familiar with that name. Konrad Lorenz studied so-called imprinting behaviors and fixed action pattern behaviors. He's most famous, at least in scientific circles, for getting geese to believe that he was their parent. And if you were to put into Google Conrad with a K, Lorenz, just as it sounds, Konrad Lorenz, geese, you're going to see a lot of photos of Conrad walking down roads with a lot of geese following him or swimming in lakes with a lot of geese following him. He had a habit of geese adopting him because of the behaviors that he partook in. So he would swim out on a lake in front of a bunch of little geese and then they would think that he was the parent and they would imprint on him. He even lived with these animals and they lived with him, sort of a strange character from what I hear. But nonetheless, all this work was deserving of a Nobel prize because what he discovered were fixed action patterns. That is patterns of behavior that could be evoked by a single stimulus. Okay. This is really important. The idea that you can get a whole category of behaviors, like swimming behind a parent, or looking to somebody for comfort, and only them, the idea that you could get a huge category of different behaviors in a bunch of different contexts triggered by just the presence of that person is remarkable, because what it suggested and what turns out to be true is that there are neural circuits, not just individual brain areas, but collections of brain areas that work together to engage a pattern of behaviors. And that's the first fundamental principle that we need to define today, that when we talk about aggression, we are talking about activation of neural circuits, not individual brain areas, but neural circuits that get played out in sequence like keys on a piano, but that playing out in sequence means that aggression is a verb. It has a beginning, a middle and an end, and it's a process. It's not an event. And as you'll see, that turns out to be very important in terms of thinking about how one can halt aggression, prevent it from happening before it's initiated, or maybe even prolonging aggression, if that's what's needed. Now, Konrad Lorenz had no real knowledge of neural circuits. I mean, obviously he knew there was this thing that we call a brain and a nervous system, and he knew that there were chemicals in the brain and hormones and things of that sort that were likely to play a role, but he really didn't take any measures to define what the neural circuits were, frankly, he didn't need to. He had his Nobel prize and he did all this beautiful work. He's known for an abundance of work, but he did think about what sorts of underlying processes could drive something like aggression. And he talked about one particular feature that's especially important, and that's this notion of a pressure. The idea that yes, certain hormones will bias somebody or an animal to be aggressive, certain neural transmitter states, and you'll learn what those are today will bias somebody to be more or less aggressive, maybe even submissive and passive, maybe outright proactively aggressive towards anyone or anything in front of them. And yes, of course there will be historical features based on their childhood, et cetera, et cetera. He understood that there will be a constellation of things that would drive people to be aggressive. And he described a so-called pressure, almost like a hydraulic pressure. Just think about fluid pressure in a small container being pushed, pushed, pushed until the can, or the container is ready to explode and how multiple features, multiple variables could impinge on that and create that pressure. It turns out that's exactly the way the system works. There is no single brain area that flips the switch for aggression. Although we'll soon talk about a brain structure that generally houses the propensity and the output of aggression. This notion of a hydraulic pressure that can drive us toward aggressive behavior or conversely can be very low pressure and keep us in a state of non-reactivity, maybe even passivity or submissiveness is a very important feature because it really captures the essence of how neural circuits work when we're talking about primitive behaviors generally. And you can start to notice this in yourself and in others, you can start to notice when you are veering toward aggression or when someone is veering toward aggression, verbal or physical. Now that veering is the buildup of this hydraulic pressure that Lorenz was referring to, and it really does have an underlying biological basis. Now it was some years later that the first experiments came along, which really started to identify the brain areas and the biological so-called pressures that can induce aggressive behavior. And the person that really gets credit for this is a guy by the name of Walter Hess, who at that time was working on cats. And I know that when say working on cats, a lot of people will cringe. A lot of people have cats as pets, and certainly cats can be delightful. Some people like them more, some people like them less. Most people cringe at the idea of doing experiments on cats. I should say that these days, very few laboratories work on cats. Most laboratories that work on animal models will work on flies, Drosophila fruit flies for their capacity to do genetics, on laboratory mice, sometimes rats, but usually mice. And occasionally you'll find a lab that still works on cats. Back in the time of Hess, very few laboratories worked on mice, most laboratories worked on cats or rats. And the reason for that is nowadays most laboratories use mice if they use animal models because of the genetic tools that exist in mice to knock out this gene or knock in this gene, et cetera, which can't be done in humans or non-human primates, at least not very easily at this point in history. So when I say he was working on cats, I realized that probably evokes some negative emotions in some of you, maybe even aggression in some of you, what we can do, however, is look at the data and make use of the data in terms of our understanding. What Hess did was he had cats that were awake and he was able to lower a stimulating electrode into their brain. Now keep in mind that the brain does not have any pain sensors. So after a small hole is made in the skull, electrodes are lowered into the brain. This is what's done commonly in human neurosurgery. And he was able to stimulate different brain areas and he was sort of poking around. And when I say sort of, he was doing this with some logical intent and purpose, he wasn't just poking around in there for fun. He was trying to identify brain regions that could generate entire categories of behavior, ALA Lorenz, right? These fixed action pattern behaviors. Eventually his electrode landed in a site and he provided electrical stimulation to the cat that caused this otherwise passive purring relaxing cat to suddenly go into an absolute rage. So arched back, hissing hair up. So called piloerection, where the hairs go up, animals try to make themselves as big as possible often when they're aggressive. Drooling, maybe even spitting, believe it or not, cats and other animals can do this. And the cat tried to attack him or anyone else, and anything else, even inanimate objects when he stimulated this particula brain area. So Hess obviously took notice of this incredible transformation in behavior. And the fact that when he turned off the stimulation of this particular brain area, the cat very quickly within seconds, went back to being passive calm kitty. Now, of course, he repeated this experiment in other animals because he had to confirm that it wasn't just happenstance, that there wasn't something unique about this one cat that perhaps he had stimulated an area that had been built up during the kittenhood of this cat and had been reactivated. Maybe this kitten had been traumatized early in life or scared and reactivation of a particular circuit, unique to that cat created this aggressive behavior. That wasn't the case, every cat that he looked at and stimulated this particular brain area, the cat would immediately go into an aggressive, almost rage type behavior. Now, of course we can't anthropomorphize. We don't know what the cat was feeling. For all we know the cat could be happy, although that seems pretty unlikely and later experiments done in mice, but also in humans confirm that indeed, stimulation of this brain area evoked not just behavioral aggression, but also subjective feelings of aggression and anger. So what was this incredible brain area, or rather, I should say, what is the brain area that harbored this incredible capacity to generate aggressive behavior in Hess's experiments? Well, for those of you that are regular listeners of this podcast, you'll probably be relieved to know that today we're going to talk about some new neural circuits, oftentimes we'll center back on the amygdala or the prefrontal cortex, and those names will come up. And for those of you that haven't heard them before, don't worry, I'll make it clear as to what those brain areas are and what they do. But today we're going to talk a lot about the so-called VMH or ventromedial hypothalamus. The ventromedial hypothalamus is a nucleus, meaning a small collection of neurons... What are neurons? Nerve cells, and that small collection of neurons that we call the ventromedial hypothalamus is truly small. It's only about 1,500 neurons on one side of your brain and a matching 1,500 neurons on the other side of your brain and that combined 3000 neurons or so, it's not exactly 3000, but 3000 neurons or so is sufficient to generate aggressive behavior of the sort that Hess observed in the cat, and believe it or not, when you see somebody who's in an act of rage or in an act of verbal aggression or in an act of defensive aggression, protecting their family or loved ones or country, et cetera, almost certainly those neurons are engaged in that behavior. Those neurons are perhaps even generating that behavior. And next I'll describe some experiments that were done just recently within the last 10 years or so, but leading right up until this year and even last month that keep confirming again and again and again, that it is the activity of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus that are both necessary and sufficient to generate the full catalog of aggressive behaviors. Now, before I go further to describe the beautiful recent studies on the VMH, the ventromedial hypothalamus, and the important role of testosterone, and more importantly, estrogen, in the activation of aggressive behavior, that's right. That's soon to be clear to you why that's the case. I want to emphasize that the ventromedial hypothalamus is something that we should all care about. Why? Well, it turns out that many categories of psychiatric disorders, developmental disorders, and psychological challenges, things like schizophrenia, PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, borderline personality disorder, and even certain forms of autism can include elements of aggression and even violence. Now it's certainly not the case that aggression and violence are present in all people who suffer from schizophrenia or PTSD or depression or autism or borderline personality disorder. I'm absolutely not saying that. However, it can be a feature of those. And it's a well described feature in terms of trying to understand the constellation of challenges that people suffer from when they have those. So thinking about the VMH goes way beyond just understanding basic aggression in the context of adaptive aggression. So, you know, when earlier I use the example, maternal aggression, that's one adaptive form of aggression. It also can be pathologic aggression, meaning it can harm ourselves or others. So keep this in mind as we go forward, because later we're going to talk about specific tools designed to modulate or prevent aggression in, for instance, people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and especially kids with ADHD. In the meantime, let's return to the VMH, this relatively small collection of neurons. And the reason I say relatively small is, well, your brain has many hundreds of billions of neurons, maybe even trillions of neurons, the exact number of neurons isn't really clear, but it's a lot. And it certainly is a lot relative to the number of neurons this 3000 or so neurons living in your hypothalamus that can evoke this aggressive response. Experiments done by David Anderson's lab at Caltech were really the first to parse the fine circuitry and to really show that the ventromedial hypothalamus is both necessary and sufficient for aggressive behavior. These are important experiments and they're worth knowing about. What they did was they identified, first of all, where the ventromedial hypothalamus was in the mouse, that was pretty straightforward to do was sort of known before they started these experiments. And then they analyzed which genes, meaning which DNA, which of course becomes RNA and RNA becomes protein, which DNA and therefore which proteins are expressed in particular cells of the ventromedial hypothalamus. And it turns out that there's a particular category of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus that make an estrogen receptor. And it is those neurons in particular that are responsible for generating aggressive behavior. How did they know this? Well, they used a tool that's actually been described by a previous guest of this podcast. We had an episode with the psychiatrist and bioengineer and my colleague at Stanford School of Medicine, Karl Deisseroth, he and others have developed tools that allow people to control the activity of neurons essentially by remote control, by shining light on those neurons. So in the context of an experiment on a mouse, which is what David's lab did, and these were the beautiful experiments of Dayu Lin who's now in her own laboratory at New York University, put a little fiber optic cable down into the brain into the hypothalamus that is of the mouse. The mouse is able to move around in its cage freely moving, even though it has a little tether, this little wire, it's a very thin wire. And that little thin wire is actually a little what we call optrode. And the experimentalist in this case, Dayu, was able to stimulate the turning on of a little bit of blue light and that blue light activated only those estrogen receptor neurons in only the ventromedial hypothalamus and the way she was able to do that, is she had introduced a gene that had been developed by our friend, Karl Deisseroth that allows light to trigger electrical activity in those neurons. So if any of that is confusing, or if all of that is confusing, here's the experiment. There's a mouse in a cage. It has a little wire coming out of its head. It doesn't notice, believe it or not. We know this 'cause it's still eating and mating and doing all the things that mics like to do on a daily basis and sleeping, et cetera. And the mere pressing of a button will activate a little bit of light released at the end of that wire, that light activates particular neurons in this case, it's the estrogen receptor containing neurons in only the ventromedial hypothalamus. When that mouse is in a cage with another mouse, a couple of things happen depending on what the other mouse is, or we could say who the other mouse is. If it's a male mouse and you put in there with a female mouse, the male mouse will attempt to mate with a female mouse provided that the male mouse has gone through puberty. He will try to mount and mate with the female mouse. Now female mice are either in a receptive phase or a non-receptive phase of their so-called estrous cycle. They don't have a menstrual 28 day cycle They have an estrous cycle. And on particular days of the estrous cycle, they are not happy to mate. They will basically keep their hindquarters away from the male mouse at all costs. They'll even attack the male mouse. On certain days of the estrous cycle, however, the female mouse will undergo what's called lordosis, which is an arching of her back and she'll allow the male to mount and mate with her. So a large number of experiments were done, but the first experiment really was to put the male mouse in with a female mouse who's in the so-called receptive phase of estrus. That is, she will allow mating and he starts mating with her and they go through the standard repertoire of mating behaviors that you observe in mice: mounting, thrusting, intromission as it's called in the mouse sex world. Well, I guess I don't know what the mice call it, but that's what the experimenters call it. And then afterwards that he will dismount, okay. So they observe this kind of mounting and sex behavior is very typical, but about halfway through the behavior, Dayu turned on the light to stimulate these estrogen receptor containing neurons only in the male mouse and what she observed was incredibly dramatic. The male mouse ceases from trying to mate with the female mouse and immediately tries to kill the female mouse. He starts attacking her. Then she turns off the light, the male stops and goes back to trying to mate with the female mouse. So I'm sure all of this was very confusing and disturbing to the female mouse. Nonetheless, that was the repertoire. They would mate. She would stimulate these ventromedial hypothalamus neurons. The male mouse would immediately try and attack and kill the female mouse. And then she would stop the stimulation and he would stop trying to attack and kill the female mouse, return to the attempt, at least, to mate with the female mouse. These are such dramatic shifts in behavior triggered only by the activation of only the small set of neurons within the ventromedial hypothalamus. And for those of you that think that you can watch this sort of thing without being disturbed, I encourage you to go to YouTube. We will provide a link where you can see a video of this type of behavior. It's incredibly dramatic. The shift in behavior is almost instantaneous, occurs within seconds, if not milliseconds, thousandths of a second. The next experiment that she did was to put a male mouse with this stimulation with light capability in its ventromedial hypothalamus into a cage alone, but with a rubber glove filled with air or water. Mouse, walking around sniffing, peeing, which is what male mice seem to do. They seem to urinate everywhere, that's actually an interesting, perhaps interesting feature of male mice and actually many male animals, perhaps even humans. We don't know, or maybe we do know, basically this has been an observed time and time again in experiments, mainly by Lisa Stowers's lab at the Scripps Institute, that's characterized this. If you put female mice into an arena or a cage, they always urinate in a very small corner of that cage. Whereas if you put mail mice into an arena or a cage, the urinate everywhere, they have this obsession with spraying their urine everywhere, you can transpose that to human behavior if you like. In any event, Dayu put the mouse in the cage alone, but with this rubber glove, the mouse is walking around urinating, et cetera, doing whatever is that mice do, then she stimulates the activation of these ventromedial hypothalamus neurons, and the mouse immediately tries to kill the glove. It goes into a rage, attacking the glove as if it were another mouse or some other animate object. But of course it's an inanimate object. It's just a rubber glove. She stops the stimulation and the mouse immediately goes back to being completely calm or at least not attacking. Again, we don't know what the mouse was feeling. So these are very dramatic videos. Again, you can see them by following the link that we'll provide in the caption. If that sort of thing is going to disturb you, by to see, for instance, the attack, one mouse attacking another, please just don't watch them. I'm not interested in traumatizing anybody or you traumatizing yourself, that is. A number of different variations were done on this experiment. For instance, stimulating the VMH in female mice, as opposed to male mice, putting the female mice in with other female mice or with other male mice, no matter what variation one carries out, so it doesn't matter if it's male with female, male with male, female with female, et cetera, stimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamus in a male mouse or a female mouse evokes this very dramatic, almost instantaneous aggressive behavior, physically aggressive behavior. Subsequent experiments done by Dayu Lin in her own laboratory and other laboratories have shown that the ventromedial hypothalamus connected with a bunch of other brain areas that are interesting, And I'll talk about some of those in a little bit, but one of them that I want to call out now is the so-called PAG, the periaqueductal gray nucleus. This is a large structure in the back of the brain that houses things like neurons that can create opioids. We all know of the opioid crisis, but these are neurons that can produce endogenous, means made by the body, chemicals that can cause pain relief. You could understand why that might occur in a circuit for aggression, right? Even if one is the aggressor, it's likely that they may incur some physical damage and they'd want some pain relief. The PAG also is connected to a number of neural circuits that eventually, through several processing stations, excuse me, arrive at things like the jaws. And in fact, stimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamus can evoke biting and aggressive biting behavior. Now aggressive biting behavior is particularly interesting because in humans and especially in human children, biting is something that, while young children might do as a form of aggression, tends to disappear pretty early in childhood. And if it doesn't, it's often seen as a mark of pathology. I have a story about this, actually, when I was a kid, I went to a summer sports camp and I'll never forget this, so we're playing soccer and in a rare stroke of luck or accident, I happened to score a goal. I wasn't a particularly good soccer player, especially not at that stage of my life. They later figured out that it was just better to make me a fullback, 'cause I could just wait there and do what fullbacks do. I was better at taking the ball or the person out than I was putting the ball in the goal. Nonetheless, I, again, by chance, scored a goal and I was trotting back to my side of the field, and all of a sudden I felt this sting in my back, a kid, not to be named, although I do remember your name, I'm not going to tell you what his name was. A kid jumped on my back and bit me on the top of my back. And this of course resulted in a discussion and a timeout and all the usual things and parents I think got involved. I don't recall, I didn't think much else of it, but I recall that this was considered especially troubling behavior because he bit me as opposed to hit me or shoved me down or something that sort, and it does seem as if the tendency to use biting as an aggressive behavior is associated with a more primitive circuitry. Now here I'm truly anthropomorphizing. I don't know what this other kid happened to be thinking or feeling at the time, how could I? And I certainly am not going to say that biting in every case reflects a pathology, although I think there is general agreement in the psychology community, in the psychiatric community that past a certain age, the using of one's teeth to impart aggression and damage on others is a particularly primitive and troubling or at least for the observer or the person experiencing is a pretty disturbing event. Dayu's lab has shown that activation of the ventromedial hypothalamus triggers a downstream circuit in the periaqueductal gray which then triggers a whole other set of circuits of fixed action patterns. Here we are back to Lorenz with fixed action patterns, including swinging of the limbs, right punching. And this wouldn't necessarily be controlled punching, but also biting behavior. So it's remarkable to me, at least that we have circuits in our brain that can evoke violent use of things like our mouth or violent use of things like our limbs. That of course could be used for things like singing or kissing or eating or, you know, gesticulating in any kind of polite or impolite way. The point here is that neural circuits, not individual brain areas evoke the constellation of behaviors that we call aggression. Now, many of you are probably puzzled or at least should be because I've been talking about this highly specialized brain area, the ventromedial hypothalamus and this highly specialized subcategory of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus, these neurons that make estrogen receptors. And yet the activation of those cells triggers dramatic and immediate aggression, both in males and in females and both against males and against females. So what's going on here? Most of us think about estrogen and we don't immediately think of aggression. Most of us hear testosterone and we might think about aggression, although other things as well. In order to understand this, I just want to briefly refer back to a conversation that I had on a previous episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast. And that was with my colleague, the great Robert Sapolsky of course, is a professor at Stanford who studied testosterone and its impacts on behavior as well as estrogen and other hormones and their impacts on behavior. To make a long story short and to dispel a still unfortunately very common myth. Testosterone does not increase aggressiveness, testosterone increases proactivity and the willingness to lean into effort in competitive scenarios. Sometimes this is referred to as the challenge hypothesis, but to make a long story short, if people are given testosterone, or if you look at people who have different levels, excuse me, of testosterone, endogenously that they naturally make. What you'll find is that testosterone tends to increase competitiveness, but not just in aggressive scenarios. So if somebody is already aggressive, giving them testosterone will have the tendency to make them more aggressive. If somebody however is very benevolent and altruistic, giving them testosterone will make them more benevolent and altruistic, at least up to a point. Now, of course there are certain forms of synthetic testosterones that are known in sports circles and in other circles to increase aggressiveness because of the way those particular forms of synthetic testosterones work. But in general, most of the experiments that I'm referring to have not been done using those, they've been done using the let's call them the more traditional biological forms of testosterone or that resemble the biological forms of testosterone. In fact, Robert Sapolsky described a really interesting experiment in which, if you look at testosterone levels or you administer additional testosterone to people who are doing philanthropy, giving money to organizations and so they're essentially doing good because these are organizations doing good. What you find is that increased testosterone or further increasing testosterone makes people more willing to compete, to give more money than the other person in the room in order, you know, to put it in air quotes, \\\"To Alpha out the other person,\\\" by giving more money. So this is an act of altruistic or benevolent philanthropy. It is not an act of aggression. Of course, we don't know what the people are feeling underneath all that. Again, we can't anthropomorphize or project onto other people what they're feeling. But the point is that testosterone itself does not make people more aggressive. And in the experiments that we've been talking about up until now, it's actually the activation of estrogen receptor containing neurons that makes these animals more aggressive. And it turns out there's evidence that in certain context, estrogen can make people more aggressive. So what's going on here? Well, what's going on is that testosterone can be converted into estrogen through a process called aromatization. There's an enzyme called aromatase. Anytime you have word that ends in A-S-E, at least if it's in the context of biology, it's almost always not always, but almost always an enzyme. So the aromatase enzyme converts testosterone into estrogen, and it is actually testosterone, aromatized, converted into estrogen and then binding to these estrogen containing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus that triggers aggression. I want to repeat that, it is not testosterone itself, that triggers aggression. It is testosterone aromatized into estrogen within the brain and binding to these estrogen receptor containing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus that evokes aggression and dramatic aggression at that. Now this effect of estrogen causing aggression in the brain is very robust, so much so that if you take a mouse that lacks the aromatase enzyme or a human that lacks the aromatase enzyme, and they do exist, then there is a reduction in overall aggression, despite high levels of testosterone. And if people who or mice who have the aromatase enzyme have that enzyme blocked, well, then it doesn't matter how much you increase testosterone or any of its other derivatives. You do not observe this aggression. So this runs counter to everything that we know and think about the role of testosterone. Again, testosterone increases competitiveness. It can increase the desire to work under challenge. I've said it before, and I ran this or pressure tested this against Robert Sapolsky who's been working on testosterone and it's role in the brain and behavior for many decades now. It is fair to say that testosterone has the net effect of making effort feel good, or at least increasing the threshold at which effort feels bad or unsustainable. And it does that by way of changing the activity or the threshold for activation of brain structures, like the amygdala and other brain structures associated with anxiety. So the next time somebody says, testosterone makes people aggressive. You can say, \\\"Ah, no, actually it's estrogen that makes people aggressive, and animals aggressive for that matter. Now of course it is the case that because males have relatively less estrogen circulating in their brain and body than females, right? Because they have testes, not ovaries, that testosterone is required in the first place in order to be converted into estrogen, to activate this aggressive circuit involving these estrogen receptor containing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus. But nonetheless, it is estrogen that is the final step. It is the hormone on which aggression hinges. And I think for most people, that's a quite surprising finding. And yet this is perhaps one of the more robust findings in both the animal and human literature, as it relates to hormones and psychological states and behavior. Now, of course it is the case that if testosterone is low, that a person or an animal will exhibit less aggressive behavior, but that's not because of reduced testosterone per se. It's because of the subsequent reduction in testosterone, meaning if there's no testosterone to aromatize into estrogen, estrogen will also be lower. So we've established that it's not testosterone, but testosterone converted into estrogen that activates these circuits for aggression. But nonetheless, it's still surprising, right? I mean, most of us don't think about estrogen as the hormone that stimulates aggression, but it turns out it's all contextual. There are beautiful data showing that whether or not estrogen stimulates aggression, can be powerfully modulated by whether or not days are short or days are long. In other words, whether or not here's a lot of sunshine or not. Now, obviously brain is encased in skull. So it doesn't really know if there's a lot of sunshine out there even though you can see the sun with your eyes, you can feel it on your skin. Day length is converted into hormonal signals and chemical signals and the primary hormonal and chemical signals involve melatonin and dopamine and also the stress hormones. So to make a very long story short, in the long days where we get a lot of sunlight, both in our eyes and on our skin, melatonin levels are reduced. Melatonin is a hormone that tends to produce states of sleepiness and quiescence. It also tends to activate pathways that tend to reduce things like breeding and sexual behavior. In long days, dopamine is increased. Dopamine is a molecule associated with feelings of wellbeing and motivation and the desire to seek out all sorts of things, all sorts of motivated behaviors. And in long days provided we're getting enough sunlight on our skin and to our eyes, the stress hormones, especially cortisol, and some of the other stress hormones are reduced in levels. If estrogen levels are increased experimentally under long day conditions, it does not evoke aggression. However, in short days, if estrogen is increased, there's a heightened predisposition for aggression. And that makes perfect sense. If you think about what short days do to the biology of your brain and body. In short days, the melatonin signal goes up. There's more melatonin circulating for more of each 24 hour cycle. Stress hormones are circulating more. Why? Short days tend to be associated with winter. In winter, we are bombarded with more bacterial viruses because bacterial viruses actually survive better in cold than they do in heat. In fact, in my laboratory, we work with a lot of viruses and bacteria and when we want to keep them alive, we put them in the freezer. If we want to kill them, if we want to inoculate them, we put them under UV light. Like you would see from the sunlight. So shorter days are conducive to aggression. Not because days are short per se, but because stress hormone levels are higher and because dopamine levels are lower. Now, here's where all of this starts to converge on a very clear biological picture, a very clear psychological picture, and indeed a very clear set of tools that we can think about and use. Under conditions where cortisol is high, where this stress hormone is elevated and under conditions where the neuromodulator serotonin is reduced there is a greater propensity for estrogen to trigger aggression. Now, again, I know I've said it before, but for males who make a lot of testosterone relative to estrogen, you have to swap in your mind this idea that if testosterone is high, that means that estrogen is low because while that can be true in the periphery in the body, if testosterone is high, there is going to be some aromatization, that conversion of testosterone to estrogen. So anytime you hear that testosterone is high, you should think testosterone is high in the body and perhaps estrogen is low in the body. But that means that there's going to be heightened levels of estrogen in the brain and therefore increased propensity for aggression. In females who generally make less testosterone relative to estrogen, there is sufficient estrogen already present to trigger aggression. So both males and females are primed for aggression, but that's riding on a context and that context of whether or not you get a tendency for aggression or not. depends on whether or not cortisol is high or low, and I'm telling you that if cortisol is relatively higher in any individual, there's going to be a tilt, an increase in that hydraulic pressure that Lorenz talked about toward aggression. And if serotonin, the neuromodulator that is associated with feelings of wellbeing and sometimes even of slight passivity, but certainly of wellbeing, if serotonin is low, there's also going to be a further shift towards an aggressive tendency. So if we return to Lorenz's hydraulic pressure model of aggression in other internal states, we realize that external stimuli, things that we hear, things that we see, for instance, someone saying something upsetting or us, seeing somebody do something that we don't like to others or to us, as well as our internal state, our subjective feelings of wellbeing, but also our stress level, our feelings of whether or not we have enough resources and are content with what we have. All of that is converging on this thing that we call internal state and creating this pressure of either to be more aggressive or less aggressive. And now we have some major players feeding into that final pathway. That question of whether or not will we hit the other, person, will we say the thing that is considered aggressive? Will we not say it? If somebody says something or does something aggressive to us, will we respond or will we be submissive or even passive? Again, there are many things funneling into that question and dictating whether or not the answer is, \\\"Absolutely I'll fight back,\\\" or, \\\"I'm going to attack them even unprovoked.\\\" Or if they say this, I'm going to do that, or no matter what they do, I'm not going to respond. These kinds of things are very complex. And yet we really can boil them down to just a few common elements. And I'm telling you that those elements are whether or not cortisol levels are relatively lower or relatively higher. Again, relatively higher is going to tend to make people more reactive. Why? Because reactivity is really a function of the autonomic nervous system, which is sort of like a seesaw that oscillates between the so-called sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system, which tends to put us into a state of readiness through the release of adrenaline. Cortisol and adrenaline when they're circulating the brain and body, make us more likely to move and to react and to speak. It's actually what will induce a kind of low level tremor, which is an anticipatory tremor to be able to move more quickly, right? A body in motion is more easily set into further motion, that is, and the neuromodulator serotonin is a neuromodulator that in general is associated with feelings of wellbeing in response to what we already have. So when we are well fed, serotonin tends to be released in our brain and body, in particular, well fed with carbohydrates, the precursor to serotonin is tryptophan. And indeed there are nice studies exploring the types of diets, nutritional programs that can reduce aggressive behavior, both in children and in adults and tryptophan-rich diets or supplementation with tryptophan. So for tryptophan rich diets, things like white turkey meat, but then there are also a number of carbohydrates you can look up. It's very easy to find foods that contain lots of tryptophan. Those foods contain the precursor to serotonin. Now it isn't simply the case that eating more foods with tryptophan will tend to reduce your aggression. I suppose it could do that, if you ate it in abundance, it could make you tired and then you're less likely to be aggressive, I don't recommend that strategy, but the idea here is that when it's been explored, increasing levels of tryptophan either by supplementation or by food or drugs, prescription drugs that increase serotonin. So for instance, fluoxetine sometimes called Prozac or Zoloft or any number of the other SSRIs tend to reduce aggressive behavior. Now, not always, but in general, that's the case. Similarly, because elevated cortisol tends to shift the whole system, again, create more of a hydraulic pressure towards aggressive states. If cortisol levels are reduced, well then the tendency for aggressive behavior is reduced. This is supported by a number of peer reviewed studies. We'll provide links to some of those in the caption show notes. And we're going to return to these a bit later in the context of specific studies that have looked at genetic variants in different individuals that cause them to make more or less serotonin, or at least to metabolize serotonin differently. This is also the case for so-called intermittent explosive disorder that can often be associated with gene variants that control how much serotonin is made or how it's metabolized or how much cortisol is made and how much it's metabolized. In thinking about tools that are a number of things that one could consider. First of all, there are a number of decent studies exploring how supplementation with the Omega-3 fatty acids, which are precursors of some of the transmitter systems, including serotonin that can modulate not directly mediate, but modulate mood and emotional tone supplementation with the omega 3 S has been shown to reduce impulsivity and aggressiveness in certain contexts in things like ADHD or in individuals who have a predisposition for aggressive type behavior or aggressive thinking. Now that doesn't necessarily mean that the omega 3 fatty acids are going directly to the ventromedial hypothalamus and changing the activity of neurons there more likely they are causing or modulating an overall shift in mood through the immune system, through hormone systems that are changing the overall tone or the propensity for neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus to be activated. How much omega 3 fatty acid, what source? Well, we've talked about this on the podcast before. You can, of course get omega 3 fatty acids from a number of different foods. Getting them from whole foods is probably the best way to do it, but many people, including people with depression will often supplement with one gram or more of omega 3 fatty acid per day. Some people including myself will take them every day as just a general mood enhancer. I don't suffer from depression, but I've found it be beneficial for my health. And so some people do that, and I've talked about before, how in double blind placebo controlled studies, people taking one to three grams of omega 3 fatty acids per day, typically in the form of a high quality fish oil, although there are other sources as well, algae and so forth, can experience improvements in mood that are on par with some of the SSRIs, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. And of course, if you're prescribed an SSRI by your psychiatrist or other doctor, please do take that and don't cease to take it just simply to take omega 3s. However you might mention to them, and you can find links to the studies in our previous episodes on depression that supplementation with omega 3 fatty acids of at this one gram or more of EPA specifically, so getting above that one gram threshold, as high as three grams per day of the EPA has allowed people to take lower doses of SSRIs and still keep their mood in a place that's beneficial for them. And in terms of keeping cortisol in a range that's healthy and doesn't bias someone toward high levels of aggression and irritability, that's again, going to be set by a number of larger modulators or contextual cues. And I've talked about some of those on the podcast, but I'll just briefly recap them now, obviously getting sunlight in your eyes early in the day, and as much sunlight as you safely can in your eyes throughout the day is going to be important. Again, because of this effect of estrogen in long days, not increasing aggression, however, in shorter days, estrogen increases aggression because of the increase in cortisol observed in short days. Another way to reduce cortisol was discussed in our episode on heat and the use of sauna and heat, but also hot baths. It turns out that hot baths and sauna can be very beneficial for reducing cortisol. All the details on that are included in the episode on heat and it's timestamped, so you can go directly to that if you want to learn about the temperatures and the various durations, but to just give a synopsis of that, a 20 minute sauna at anywhere from 80 to a hundred degrees Celsius is going to be beneficial for reducing cortisol. If you don't have access to a sauna, you could do a hot bath, adjust the temperature so you don't burn yourself. I think 80 to a hundred degrees Celsius is going to be too hot for many people if it's a hot bath, whereas many people who can't tolerate that hot bath can tolerate the sauna. So safety first always, and of course, but hot baths reduce cortisol, hot saunas, reduce cortisol of a duration about 20 or 30 minutes is going to be beneficial. And of course, some of you may be interested in exploring the supplementation route and for reductions in cortisol, really the chief player there is ashwagandha, which is known to decrease cortisol, fairly potently. I should just warn you that if you're going to use ashwagandha in order to reduce cortisol, first of all, check with your doctor or healthcare provider before adding or subtracting anything from your supplementation or health regimen. Of course, I don't just say that to protect us. I say that to protect you, you are responsible for your health, what you take and what you don't take. Chronic supplementation with ashwagandha can have some not so great effects of disruption of other hormone pathways and neurotransmitter pathways. So the limit seems to be about two weeks of regular use before you'd want to take a break of about two weeks. So ashwagandha again, a very potent inhibitor of cortisol, but with some other effects as well, don't use it chronically for longer than two weeks. But if your goal is to reduce cortisol, let's say you're going through a period of increased irritability and aggressive tendency, maybe you're also not getting as much light as you would like, and perhaps also, if there are other circumstantial things leading you towards more aggressiveness and your goal is to reduce aggressiveness, that can be potentially helpful. And in light of all this stuff about cortisol and estrogen and day length, I should mention that there are in fact, some people who have a genetic predisposition to be more irritable and aggressive, and there are a couple of different gene pathways associated with this. We never like to think about just one gene causing a specific behavior. The way to think about genes is that genes generally code for things within our biology. In the context of today's discussion, things like neural circuits or the amounts of neurotransmitters that are made, or the amounts of hormones that are made, or the amount of neurotransmitter hormone receptors or enzymes, et cetera, that shift the activity of our biology in a particular direction. They bias our biology. And in fact, there is a genetic variant present in certain people that adjusts their estrogen receptor sensitivity, and that estrogen receptor sensitivity can result in increased levels of aggression, sometimes dramatic increases, however, and also very interestingly, photo period, meaning day length, is a strong modulator of whether or not that aggressiveness turns up or not. Whether or not that person with the particular gene variant is more aggressive or not, depends on how long the day is and how long the night is. One particular study that I like that references this is Trainer, et al, the title of the study is \\\"Photo period reverses the effects of estrogens on male aggression, via genomic and non-genomic pathways.\\\" This was a paper published in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. We'll put a reference to this in the show notes, if you'd like to explore it further, but it really points to the fact that rarely, sometimes, but rarely, is it the case that just one gene will cause somebody to be hyper aggressive. Almost always there's going to be an interplay between genetics and environment and as environment changes such as day length changes and the length of night changes, so too, will the tendency for people with a given genetic variant to be more aggressive or not. Now, of course, in the absence of detailed genetic testing for this particular estrogen receptor variant, most people, I'm guessing you, are probably not walking around knowing that you have this gene or not. Regardless, I think it's important to pay attention to how you feel at different times of year, depending on whether or not summer, whether or not it's winter, whether or not you're getting sufficient sunlight, meaning viewing sufficient sunlight or not, whether or not you're getting sufficient sunlight exposure to your skin or not, whether or not you're indoors all the time. Generally those things correlate with season, but not always. You can go through long bouts of hard work in the summer months when days are long, but you're indoors a lot and getting a lot of fluorescent light exposure late in the evening. And perhaps that's when you're feeling more aggressive. So we have to be careful about drawing a one-to-one relationship between any biological feature and certainly psychological or behavioral feature like aggressiveness, but it's, I believe, helpful to know that these genetic biases exist, how they play out again, they shift our biology in a general thematic direction. They don't change one thing. They change a variety of things that bias us toward or away from certain psychological and behavioral outcomes and the various things that we can do in order to offset them. And we described those earlier in terms of trying to keep cortisol low by getting sufficient sunlight regardless of time of year, and regardless of whether or not you happen to have this particular genetic variant. So earlier I talked about how it is testosterone converted into estrogen that's activating aggression in the ventromedial hypothalamus, not testosterone itself. However, there are some studies carried out in humans that have evaluated the effects of testosterone and how levels of testosterone correlate with aggressiveness in the short term. I'm just going to detail a few of those studies because I think they are interesting and important. First of all, there is a study that has explored levels of testosterone in men of different professions. Now, before I tell you the data, I want to be very clear here, with a study such as this, one never knows whether or not these men went into a particular profession because they had a testosterone level of a given value or whether or not the work itself altered their testosterone levels or both. And I think it's fair to assume that it's probably both. So be very careful in assuming that a given testosterone level is causal for choosing a particular career or that a particular career is causal for creating a particular testosterone level. This study used salivary testosterone levels as the measure, which to be fair is not the best way to measure testosterone. Typically blood draw would be the best way to measure testosterone, but nonetheless, provided the appropriate methods are used, salivary testosterone can be a reasonable measure of testosterone. The different occupations that were looked at were, and here they just looked at men in this particular study were ministers, salesmen, they didn't say what particular types of salesmen, firemen, professors, of all things, physicians and NFL players. And what they discovered was that the testosterone levels were essentially in that order from low to highest. So minister, salesman, fireman, professor, physician, NFL player. Now we could micro dissect all the different stereotypes and all the different features of each of these jobs. For instance, we don't know whether or not the fact that the firemen happened, at least in this study to have lower testosterone levels on average than the professors or the physicians was because firemen have lower testosterone levels or because they have a much more stressful job and their cortisol levels are higher than the professor or the physician and cortisol and testosterone, not always, but generally are in somewhat antagonistic push-pull mode because they derive from the same precursor, et cetera. Typically, when cortisol is high, testosterone tends to be lower and vice versa. So we don't know what's causing these effects. And again, this is just one study and just six occupations, but I think it's relatively interesting given the fact that each of these professions involves different levels of competitiveness, right? So we don't necessarily just want to think about the level of physical exertion that's required, but also the level of competitiveness because it's known that competitive interactions can cause increases in testosterone, in particular, in the winners of competitive interactions, a topic for a future podcast. Meanwhile, studies that have analyzed also again, salivary testosterone in prisoners, in this case, female prisoners, so these are incarcerated individuals, have looked at levels of testosterone according to whether or not the person committed a non-violent or a violent crime in order to arrive in prison. And higher levels of salivary testosterone were related to those that had arrived in prison because of conviction of a violent crime, as opposed to a nonviolent crime. Likewise, when they analyzed prison rule violations, so an indirect measure of aggressiveness, but in this case, it was strongly associated with aggressiveness because they knew what the violations were, they found were for prisoners that had none, no prison violations, prison rule violations I should say, their testosterone levels tended to be lower than the testosterone levels of women that had some, even one, or more aggressive violations of prison rules. We'll provide links to these studies in the show notes if you'd like to go into them further, obviously studies like this need to be taken with a grain of salt because there are so many different factors, different prisons have different degrees of violence to begin with and competitiveness to begin with. But just as a final pass at examining the role between testosterone and aggressiveness, there was a very interesting study from Goetz, et al, G-O-E-T-Z published in 2014, that looked at serum, so in this case, blood levels of testosterone. 30 minutes after application of a gel-based testosterone that goes transdermal so that the testosterone can go very quickly into the bloodstream, and then did brain imaging to evaluate the activity of neurons in the so-called corticomedial amygdala, the cortico, the medial amygdala is one of the areas of the amygdala complex as we call it because it's complex, it's got a lot of different nuclei, you know, know what nuclei are, low clusters of neurons. It's got a lot of different ones, but that medial and that cortico medial amygdala in particular, is known to be associated with aggressive type behaviors. It's linked up with as part of the larger circuit that includes the ventromedial hypothalamus and other brain areas that we referred to earlier, such as the PAG. What is remarkable about this study is that it showed that just 30 minutes after application of this so-called AndroGel, this testosterone that seeps into the bloodstream, there was a significant increase in of course, testosterone and corticomedial amygdala activation. So testosterone can have acute effects, immediate effects on the pathways related to aggression. And I think this is something that's not often discussed because many of the effects of steroid hormones like testosterone, and estrogen are very slow acting. In fact, steroid hormones, because they have a certain biochemical composition can actually pass through the membranes of cells, so the outside of a cell and into the nucleus of the cell and change gene expression in the cell, you think about puberty, the kid that goes home for the summer and then comes back looking completely different. Well that's because of a lot of genes got turned on by steroid hormones like testosterone and estrogen, but the steroid hormones can also have very fast acting effects and with testosterone in particular, those can be remarkably fast acting and one of the most apparent and well documented fast acting effects is this effect: the ability to activate cells within the amygdala, so you might say, \\\"Well, I thought the amygdala was associated with fear?\\\" Wouldn't testosterone then cause fear? No. Turns out that the amygdala harbors, both cortisol, corticosteroid receptors and testosterone receptors, and they each adjust the activity in the amygdala differently, such that testosterone tends to activate amygdala circuitry for inducing states of mind and body that are more action based and indeed in animals and in humans, testosterone application and activation of this corticomedial amygdala pathway will make animals and humans lean into effort. This is why I say testosterone makes effort feel good, or at least biases the organism toward leaning into challenge. So if you recall, there's not just one type of aggression, there's reactive aggression, which is triggered when one is confronted with something that sometimes is inevitable, right? One needs to fight for their life or for somebody else's life, but also proactive aggression and proactive aggression involves activation of those go-pathways in the basal ganglia and a leaning into effort to overcome whatever state one happens to be in to begin with. And so this is very important because it points to the fact that yes, estrogen is activating aggression pathways that are in the ventromedial hypothalamus, but it's very likely the case that testosterone is acting to accelerate or to bias states of mind and body toward those that will lead to aggression. Again, aggression is not like a switch, on and off. It's a process. It has a beginning, a middle and an end. Remember that hydraulic pressure that Conrad Lorenz hypothesized? Well, think of testosterone as increasing the pressure toward an aggressive episode and then estrogen actually triggering that aggressive episode in the ventromedial hypothalamus. So if somebody tells you that testosterone, endogenous or exogenous makes people aggressive, tell them no, testosterone tends to make people lean into effort. And if that effort involves being aggressive, either reactively aggressive or proactively aggressive, well then it will indeed lead to aggression. But the actual aggression itself is triggered by estrogen, not testosterone. Now, thus far, we really haven't talked too much about the social context in which aggression occurs. And that's because there is a near infinite, if not infinite number of variables that will determine that. So for instance, violent aggression is entirely appropriate at a professional boxing match provided it's occurring inside the ring and only between the competitors and within the bounds of the rules of the sport, et cetera. However, there are some things that tend to bias certain social context toward being more aggressive or less aggressive and not always physical aggression. And those generally come in two forms that many of you are familiar with, which are alcohol and caffeine. Let's discuss caffeine first. Why would caffeine increase aggressive impulsivity? Well, the general effects of caffeine are to increase autonomic arousal. The activity of the so-called sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system, which is to put it very much in plain language it's the alertness arm of your nervous system. That is, it creates a sense of readiness in your brain and body and it does so by activating the so-called sympathetic chain ganglia. Again, as I always remind people, simpa and sympathetic does not mean sympathy. Simpa means together, we're all at ones. And caffeine tends to bias our brain and body to activate the sympathetic chain ganglia, which run from about the base of your neck until the top of your pelvis and deploy a bunch of chemicals that jut out into the rest of your body, activate adrenaline release. There's a parallel increase in of adrenaline in your brain, creating the state of alertness and readiness. That state of alertness and readiness can be for all sorts of things, not just aggression. However when we are in a state of increased sympathetic tone, meaning more alert, such as after drinking caffeine, we will bias all those brain and body systems, the hormones, the chemicals, et cetera that exist, toward action as opposed to inaction. So put simply, caffeine can increase impulsivity, no surprise there. On the opposite end of things, alcohol tends to decrease activity in the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system, tends to make us feel less alert. Now, initially it can create a state of alertness because of its effects in inhibiting the forebrain, our forebrain prefrontal cortex in particular has what's called top-down inhibition. It exerts a inhibitory or a quieting effect on some of the circuits of the hypothalamus, such as the ventromedial hypothalamus. The way to conceptualize this is that your forebrain is able to rationalize and think clearly and to suppress behavior and to engage the no-go pathways telling you, \\\"Don't say that mean thing.\\\" \\\"Don't do that violent thing,\\\" et cetera. Alcohol initially tends to increase our level of overall activity by reducing inhibition, not just in that forebrain circuit, but in other circuits. Tends to make us more active. We tend to talk more than we normally would, move more than we normally would, but very shortly thereafter starts acting as a sedative by way of reducing activity in the forebrain, releasing some of the deeper brain circuits that are involved in impulsivity, but also causing a somewhat sedative effect. And then of course, as alcohol levels increase even further, people eventually will pass out, blackout, et cetera. So what we've got with alcohol and caffeine is we've got two opposite ends of the spectrum, caffeine increasing arousal and readiness, and the tendency for impulsivity and alcohol also increasing impulsivity, but through a different mechanism. A really interesting study, and I should just mention that the title of the study is, \\\"Caffeinated and non-caffeinated alcohol use and indirect aggression at the impact of self-regulation.\\\" So the title is almost self-explanatory. This was a paper published in the Journal of Addictive Behavior in 2016, examining how ingestion of alcohol that's either caffeinated or non-decaffeinated alcohol drinks impacted what they call indirect aggression. And just to remind you what indirect aggression is, these are not physical acts of aggression. These are verbal acts of aggression, so embarrassing others or otherwise, somehow trying to reduce the wellbeing of others by saying certain things in particular in groups, this study examined both males and females. This was done on by way of a college campus study, subjects were 18 to 47 years old. I guess there's some older students on that campus, or maybe they use some non-students, but you know, these days you've also got some students that are in their thirties and forties. So they have a fairly broad swath of subjects included, fairly broad racial background as well, included, not at equal numbers, but at least they included a pretty broad spectrum of people with different backgrounds. They looked in particular people that ingested non-caffeinated alcohol drinks at a frequency of 9.18 drinks per week, okay. Again, there's a college campus, not that I encourage that. I'm one of these people that I don't, I've never really liked drugs or alcohol and sort fortunate in that way I can drink or not drink and tend to not drink. But so to me, 9.18, drinks per week sounds like a lot, but I know for some people that might actually be typical. And then others who are drinking at least one caffeinated alcoholic beverage per week. And those individuals end as high, I should say as 7.87 caffeinated alcohol beverages per week. So this would be energy drinks combined, typically with hard alcohol, that's fairly commonly available in bars and so forth. And some individuals drank as much as goodness, 20.36 alcoholic drinks per week, total, some that were caffeinated, some that were not caffeinated. The basic outcome of this study was that the more alcohol someone tended to consume, the more likely it was that they would engage in these indirect aggressive type behaviors. And in terms of the caffeinated alcoholic beverages, there, the effect was especially interesting. Here I'm just going to paraphrase or I'll actually read from the study, quote, \\\"With regard to caffeinated alcoholic beverage use, our findings indicated that heavier caffeinated alcohol beverage use was associated positively with indirect aggression, even after considering one's typical alcohol use and dispositional aggression.\\\" What this means is that even though alcohol can bias certain individuals to be more aggressive, and even though certain individuals already have a disposition toward being more aggressive, there was an effect that was independent, meaning above and beyond both alcohol and a predisposition, meaning if someone was consuming caffeinated alcoholic beverages, they had a particularly high likelihood of engaging in indirect aggressive behavior. Now this makes perfect sense in light of the model they propose, which is this self-regulation model, that basically self-regulation involves several things. It involves engaging in certain behaviors and suppressing other behaviors. So as described before, because alcohol tends to have a sedative suppressive effect on the autonomic nervous system, at least after the initial period, it's going to tend to reduce the likelihood that people will engage in any type of behavior. Whereas caffeine will increase autonomic arousal and increase the likelihood that someone will engage in a particular type of behavior, aggressive or otherwise. So the combination of caffeine and alcohol is really acting as a two prong system to bias people towards more impulsivity that is less self-regulation. So it's really yanking your volitional control, your ability to engage in prefrontal top down inhibition over your hypothalamus from two distinct and specific circuits. By now, you should be getting the impression that self-regulation is a key feature of whether or not somebody, maybe even you, is going to engage in aggressive speech or aggressive behavior. And we've talked about a number of tools that one can use to reduce the probability that that will happen. I suppose, if the context were appropriate, you could even take those tool recommendations and just invert them and increase the likelihood that aggressiveness would happen. But regardless, self-regulation is key. And in light of that, I want to share with you a study that's focused on kids, but that has important ramifications for adults as well. As you probably are already aware there are many kids out there that suffer from so-called attention deficit hyperactivity, disorder, ADHD. There are also many adults we are finding that are suffering from ADHD. And there's also an epidemic I would say of people that are concerned about whether or not they have ADHD. Now whether or not they have true, clinical ADHD or not, is not clear. We did an episode all about ADHD and tools for ADHD. I would encourage you to check out that episode and some of the diagnostic criteria. If you have the opportunity you can find at hubermanlab.com, as this study I'm about to share with you aptly points out, there is no objective diagnostic marker of ADHD. There's no biomarker or blood draw or blood test for ADHD, whether or not one has ADHD depends on their performance on a number of different cognitive tests and behavioral tests and self report. In any event, the study I'm about to share with you explored how a particular pattern of supplementation in kids with ADHD was able to reduce aggressive episodes and impulsivity and increased self-regulation. And the title of the study is, \\\"Efficacy of carnitine in the treatment of children with attention deficit, hyperactivity disorder.\\\" Even though they put carnitine in the title, that what they focused on was whether or not acetyl-L-carnitine supplementation could somehow adjust the behavioral tendency of these kids with ADHD and to make a long story short, indeed it did. There was a very significant effect of acetyl L-carnitine supplementation on improving some of the symptomology, excuse me, of ADHD. A few details about this study that might be relevant to you. This was a randomized double blind placebo controlled double crossover study, this was done as an outpatient study. So the kids weren't in a hospital, they were living out in the world. This again was done on younger kids. So this was six to six to 13 year old kids that were diagnosed with ADHD. They received either acetyl L-carnitine or placebo, and they did all the good practice stuff that good researchers do of making sure that the placebo and the acetyl L-carnitine had similar look and taste. It was consumed twice daily after meals. I should just mentioned that acetyl L-carnitine typically is taken in capsule form or occasionally an injectable form. Here, they they were using this as a drink, which essentially the same as capsule form, but the powders just going directly into liquid and the carnitine dosage was 100 milligrams per kilogram. So they're doing this according to the body weight of these kids with a maximum dosage of four grams per day, the quantity of the medication was supplied here. I'm reading for a period of eight weeks and every eight weeks a new quantity of medication was supplied. So basically this is a fairly long term study, exploring behavioral outcomes and psychological outcomes in week eight, 16 and 24. They also looked at blood things that you could only get through a blood draw, so things like hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, white blood cell count, et cetera, they, these are kids and even if it were adults, they were quite appropriately examining a lot of the physiological measures that one would want to carry out to make sure, first of all, that blood levels of carnitine are increasing. And indeed they confirmed that, but also that no negative effects are showing up in the physiology as well as the psychology of these kids. So, first I'll just tell you the basic outcome of the study, which was, here I'm paraphrasing, \\\"Here, given twice daily, carnitine appeared to be effective and well tolerated treatment for a group of children with ADHD.\\\" \\\"They showed significant, the abnormal behavior compared to these other boys.\\\" And now I'm moving to the table of results. They showed significant reductions in their so-called \\\"Total Problem Score.\\\" The total problem score is a well-established measure of behavioral problems in kids with ADHD. And I should say adults with ADHD, has to do with challenges in social and learning environments and how well or poorly an individual tends to perform. Reductions in intentional problems, overall reductions in delinquency, and most important for sake of today's discussion, significant reductions in aggressive behavior. Now what's especially nice about this study, I think, is that even though it's a relatively small number of subjects and certainly needs to be repeated in other studies and other laboratories, that they were able to confirm the shifts in L-carnitine within the bloodstream of these kids, that is they were able to correlate the physiology with the psychological changes, in studies like this. And frankly in all studies of human pharmacology, you have to worry about effects that show up, not just because of placebo effects, but because of so-called off target effects or related things, totally independent of the drug or the particular supplement that you happen to be looking at, to put in the words of a great neuroscientist. Unfortunately, he passed away some years ago, but he was a member of the national academy, extremely accomplished neuroscientist once turned to me and said, \\\"Never forget a drug is a substance that when injected into an animal or a human being creates a paper,\\\" meaning you can see effects of pretty much any drug or any supplement in most all conditions. However, it is in cases such as this study, where you can quite convincingly see that the particular feature of physiology that you expected to change, actually changed. And you see a psychological outcome that you can gain much greater confidence that the changes in delinquency, in this case reduced delinquency, improved attention, reduced aggressiveness and so forth was at least somehow related to the shift in blood physiology and levels of L-carnitine or acetyl L-carnitine and carnitine in the bloodstream of these children, as opposed to something else like L-carnitine going and affecting some downstream target that you have no knowledge of. Now, of course that's still entirely possible, but I think studies such as these increase our confidence that things like L-carnitine can be used perhaps in concert with things like omega 3 supplementation, diets that are biased towards increasing more tryptophan and therefore more serotonin, obviously avoiding things like alcohol and as it appears from the study I just described, reducing one's intake or not consuming any caffeinated alcoholic beverages seems like it would be a good idea if your goal is to reduce aggressiveness, to think about the hormone context and whether or not you tend to have higher testosterone, an estrogen or lower testosterone, an estrogen, maybe even think about the work environment, whether or not you are existing in a particularly competitive work environment and even day life, time of year and whether or not you're getting sufficient sunlight, whether or not you're avoiding light in the evening and so on. So studies such as this I think are useful because they point to the fact that very seldom, if ever, will there be one supplement or one nutritional change or even one behavioral change, that's going to completely shift in individual from being aggressive and impulsive, but rather that by combining different behavioral regimens, by paying attention to things like time of year and work conditions and school conditions and overall levels of stress and likely therefore levels of cortisol, et cetera, that you can use behaviors, diet, and supplementation as a way to shift that overall internal milieu from one of providing a lot of internal hydraulic pressure as it's been called throughout the episode toward aggressive impulsivity and relax some of that hydraulic pressure and reduce aggressive tendencies. So once again, and frankly, as always, we've done a deep dive into the neurobiology and the psychology of what I believe to be an important feature of our lives, in this case aggression. I want to point out that in a episode in the not too distant future, I'm going to be hosting Dr. Professor David Anderson from Caltech University, who is the world expert on the neurobiology of aggression. In fact, he is the senior author on many of the studies related to the ventromedial hypothalamus that I discussed today. Our discussion will touch on aggression, of course. So hearing today's episode will help you digest that information, but we are also going to talk about other emotional states. He is an expert, not just in aggression, but in motivated states related to sex and mating behavior, social relationships of all kinds and how those relate, not just to biology and psychology, but also certain forms of pathology, things like PTSD and the relationship for instance, between anger, fear, anxiety, and depression, and many other important topics that I know many of you, if not all of you will be interested in. In the meantime, I want to point you to his recently released and wonderful book entitled, \\\"The Nature of the Beast, How Emotions Guide Us.\\\" And again, the author is David Anderson from Caltech. This is a wonderful book. It serves as a tremendous introduction to the history of the study of these areas, the current science and discoveries being made in these areas, all made accessible to the scientist and non-scientist alike. It's a very engaging read and so much so that even though he was gracious in sending me a copy, I also purchased myself a copy to give to somebody who is a therapist, and I've purchased another copy to give to a high school kid that I mentor because he's very interested in the neuroscience of emotions. And I think we are all interested in emotions, not just fear and some of these negative states, not just aggression, but also the positive emotions of our lives. And so, \\\"The Nature of the Beast, How Emotions Guide Us,\\\" by David Anderson is a wonderful read. I can't recommend it highly enough.

During today's episode and on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discussed supplements. While supplements aren't necessary for everybody, many people derive tremendous benefit from them, for things like improving the transition time and the quality of your sleep and improving alertness and focus. And so on. Anytime you're considering taking supplements, there are several key considerations. First of all, those supplements should be of the very highest quality. And you want to make sure that what's listed on the bottle is actually what's in the bottle, which is a problem for any supplement companies out there. The Huberman Lab Podcast is pleased to announce that we are now partnered with Momentous supplements because we believe Momentous supplements to be of the very highest quality of any supplements out there. And we've been working very closely with them in order to direct them, to create supplements that are individual ingredient supplements of the particular quality and sources that we would like to see, and that relate to the science and studies covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast. If you'd like to see some of those supplements, you can go to livemomentous.com/huberman, and there you'll see some of the supplements that we've talked about on this podcast before such as magnesium threonate for augmenting sleep, things like L-tyrosine for augmenting dopamine and things like L-carnitine, which we've discussed on today's podcast. Right now, the list of supplements and the products that are there is only partial to what will soon be included in the future. So that's an ever expanding catalog of, again, what we believe to be the very highest quality supplements available to you. For those of you that are interested in behavioral, nutritional and supplementation based tools for neuroscience and other aspects of your biology, the impact, your health and performance, we have a newsletter. It is a zero cost newsletter. It's called \\\"The Neural Network Newsletter.\\\" You can go to hubermanlab.com and there in the menu, you'll find \\\"The Neural Network Newsletter\\\" sign-up. You can just put your email. We do not share your email with anybody else. You will also find examples of the newsletter that you can download right away without having to sign up and decide if signing up is right for you. And if you're not already following us on Twitter an Instagram, we are Huberman Lab on both Instagram and Twitter. And at both places, I describe science and science based tools, some of which overlaps with the content of the Huberman Lab Podcast, but much of which is distinct from the content of the Huberman Lab Podcast. Once again, thank you for joining me for our discussion about the biology, psychology and actionable tools around aggression, and as always, thank you for your interest in science.

I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, we are going to discuss the gut and the brain, and we are going to discuss how your gut influences your brain and your brain influences your gut. As many of you probably know, there is a phenomenon called your gut feeling, which tends to be something that you seem to know without really knowing how you know it. That's one version of the gut feeling. The other is that you sense something in your actual gut, in your body, and that somehow drives you to think or feel or act in a particular way, maybe to move towards something or to move away from something. Now, today, we aren't going to focus so much on the psychology of gut feelings but on the biology of gut feelings and how the gut and brain interact. Because indeed your gut is communicating to your brain both directly by way of neurons, nerve cells, and indirectly by changing the chemistry of your body, which permeates up to your brain and impacts various aspects of brain function. But it works in the other direction, too. Your brain is influencing your entire gut. And when I say entire gut, I don't just mean your stomach, I mean, your entire digestive tract. Your brain is impacting things like how quickly your food is digesting, the chemistry of your gut, if you happen to be stressed or not stressed. Whether or not you are under a particular social challenge or whether or not you're particularly happy will in fact adjust the chemistry of your gut and the chemistry of your gut in turn will change the way that your brain works. I'll put all that together for you in the context of what we call the gut microbiome. The gut microbiome are the trillions of little bacteria that live all the way along your digestive tract and that strongly impact the way that your entire body works at the level of metabolism, immune system, and brain function. And of course, we will discuss to tools, things that you can do in order to maintain or improve your gut health. Because as you'll also soon see, gut health is immensely important for all aspects of our wellbeing at the level of our brain, at the level of our body, And there are simple, actionable things that we can all do in order to optimize our gut health in ways that optimize our overall nervous system functioning. So we will be sure to review those today. This episode also serves as a bit of a primer for our guest episode that's coming up next week with Dr. Justin Sonnenburg from Stanford University. Dr. Sonnenburg is a world expert in the gut microbiome and so we will dive really deep into the gut microbiome in all its complexity. We'll make it all very simple for you. We will also talk about actionable tools in that episode. This episode is a standalone episode, so you'll get a lot of information and tools, but if you have the opportunity to see this episode first, I think it will serve as a nice primer for the conversation with Dr. Sonnenburg. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink. I've been using Athletic Greens, which is now called AG1, since 2012 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or twice a day is that it covers all of my foundational vitamin and mineral needs and also because it contains high quality probiotics and prebiotics, which is a topic that we're going to talk a lot about today. With Athletic Greens, I can be sure that I'm getting all the vitamins and minerals that I need. So if I'm missing anything in my diet, I can compensate for that with the Athletic Greens. Plus it has the probiotics and prebiotics that can also compensate for any deficiencies that I might have in creating the right environment for my gut microbiome. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman to claim a special offer. They'll give you five free travel packs, which make it very easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're in the car or on a plane or otherwise on the move, and they'll give year's supply of vitamin D3 K2. While not everyone needs additional vitamin D3, many people do even if they're getting sufficient sunlight. So you get the year's supply of vitamin D3, and it also has K2 in there. K2 has been shown to be important for various aspects of calcium regulation, cardiovascular health, and so on. Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman to claim this special offer. Today's episode is also brought to us by LMNT. LMNT is an electrolyte drink that contains no sugar. It does however contain sodium, magnesium, and potassium. I've talked about sodium on the podcast before. I think sodium can indeed be problematic for some people with hypertension or pre-hypertension, but for many people, sodium is a great thing. It can increase blood volume in ways that can be helpful to them. It can improve nerve cell function in ways that can be helpful to them, and for me, anytime I'm exercising and sweating a lot, I want to replace my electrolytes and that means replacing sodium for adequate neuron function, muscle function, and so on. LMNT is formulated to help anyone with their electrolyte needs and is perfectly suited for people who are following a ketogenic, low carbohydrate, or paleo diet. LMNT contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio of 1000 milligrams of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium. If you'd like to try LMNT, you can go to drinklmnt.com/huberman to claim a free LMNT sample pack. You only pay the cost of shipping. Again, that's drinklmnt.com/huberman to claim a free sample pack. Today's podcast is also brought to us by InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the things that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be assessed with a quality blood test. And nowadays with the advent of modern DNA tests, you can also get insights into, for instance, what your biological age is and how that compares to your chronological age. Now, one of the major problems with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests out there is that you get numbers back, they'll tell you if those numbers are in range and out of range but they don't tell you anything about what to do with that information. With InsideTracker, they make everything very simple in terms of directing you towards particular protocols. So these could be nutrition protocols, supplementation protocols, or lifestyle behavioral protocols to help you bring those numbers into the ranges that are best for you. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans. That's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off. Okay, let's talk about the gut and the brain and how your gut and your brain communicate in both directions. Because as I mentioned before, your gut is communicating all the time with your brain and your brain is communicating all the time with your gut. And so the two are in this ongoing dance with one another, that ordinarily is below your conscious detection although you're probably familiar with the experience of every once in a while getting a stomach ache or of eating something that doesn't agree with you, or conversely eating something that you find particularly delicious and that sensation or that experience rather being a whole body experience. Your mind is excited about what you're eating or just ate, your gut is excited about what you're eating or just ate, and it seems to be a kind of unified perception of both brain and body. Today, we're going to talk about how that comes about in the negative sense. Like, you know, when you meet someone you really dislike or when you have a stomach ache, and in the positive sense, when you interact with somebody that you really, really like and you'd like to spend more time with them, for instance, or when you eat something that you really, really like and you'd like to spend more time with that food, so to speak. Now, the gut and the brain represent what we call a biological circuit, meaning they include different stations. So station A communicates with station B, which communicates with station C, and so on. And as I mentioned earlier, it is bidirectional. It's a two-way street between gut and brain. I want to make the important point at the outset that when I say the word gut, when I refer to the gut, I am not just referring to the stomach. Most of us think that the gut equates to the stomach because we think of having a gut or not having a gut or having a gut feeling of some sort. But in the context of gut-brain signaling and the related microbiome, the gut includes the entire digestive tract. That's right, from start to finish the entire digestive tract so much so that today we're going to talk about, for instance, the presence of neurons, nerve cells, that reside in your gut that communicate to specific locations in the brain and cause the release of specific neurochemicals, such as the neurochemical dopamine or serotonin, that can motivate you to seek more of a particular food or type of interaction or behavior, or to avoid particular foods, interactions, and behaviors. And some of those neurons, many of those neurons, in fact, reside in your intestines, not in your stomach. They can be in the small intestine or the large intestine. In fact, you actually have taste receptors and neurons located all along your digestive tract. You have neurons that are located all along your digestive tract and they are communicating to your brain to impact what you think, what you feel, and what you do. Okay, so for the gut-brain axis, we need to deal with the brain part and then we need to deal with the gut part. Let's just quickly talk about the brain part because there the word brain is also a bit of a misnomer in that when we say the gut-brain axis, it does include the brain but includes a lot of other things as well. So as many of you probably know by now, if you're listeners of this podcast, and if you don't, that's fine, your nervous system includes your brain and your spinal cord and those together constitute what's called the central nervous system. Your neural retinas, which are lining the back of your eyes and are the light sensing portion of your eyes are also part of your central nervous system. So actually your eyes are part of your brain. They're the only parts of your brain that are outside the cranial vault. So your retinas, your brain proper, and your spinal cord make up the central nervous system. The other parts of your nervous system constitute what's called the peripheral nervous system, which are the components of your nervous system that reside outside the retinas, brain, and spinal cord. Now, this is very important because today we're going to talk a lot about how the gut communicates with the brain. And it does that by way of peripheral nervous system components, meaning nerve cells that reside in the gut and elsewhere in the body that communicate to the brain and cross into the central nervous system to influence what you think and what you feel, okay? So that's the nervous system part of what we call the gut-brain axis, brain, again, just being a shorthand for including all the elements I just described. Gut, as you now know, includes all the elements of the digestive tract. Let's talk about the architecture or the structure of the gut of your digestive system. Now, not surprisingly your digestive system, aka your gut, begins at your mouth and ends at your anus. And all along its length, there are a series of sphincters that cut off certain chambers of the digestive tract from the other chambers. Now, also along this tube that we call the digestive tract, there's great variation in the degree of acidity, or pH as it's sometimes called. That variation in acidity turns out to give rise to different little microenvironments in which particular microbiota, microbacteria, can thrive or fail to thrive. And so the way I'd like you to think about the digestive tract, this gut component of the gut-brain axis, is that it's not just one component. It's not just your stomach with a particular acidity and a bunch of microorganisms that work particularly well to make you feel good and make your digestive pathways work well. It's a series of chambers, little microenvironments, in which particular microbiota thrive and other microbiota do not. And certain behaviors that you undertake and certain experiences that you have will adjust those microenvironments in ways that make particular microbiota, certain bacteria, more likely to thrive and others less likely to thrive. We'll talk about how that was set up for you early in life. Actually from the moment that you came into the world, that microbiome was being established. It was actually strongly impacted depending on whether or not you were born by C-section or by vaginal birth. And it was strongly impacted by who handled you when you came into the world, literally the hands that were on you. How much skin contact you had, whether or not you were a preemie baby or not, whether or not you had pets at home, whether or not you were allowed to play in the dirt, whether or not you were allowed to eat snails or whether or not you were kept in a very antiseptic environment. All of those experiences shaped these little microenvironments and shaped what constitutes best or worst for those microenvironments, okay? So you have this long tube that we call the digestive tract and it's very, very long. In fact, if we were to splay it out, we were to take all the curves and turns out of the intestine, we would find that it is very long. It's approximately nine meters long. Now, the structure of that digestive tract turns out to be very important in terms of gut-brain signaling. Once again, it's a tube and the hollow of that tube is called the lumen, L-U-M-E-N. But the walls of the tube are not necessarily smooth, at least not for significant portions of the digestive tract. For much of the digestive tract, there are bumps and grooves that look very much like the folds in the brain, but these bumps and grooves are made up of other tissues. They're made up of what's called a mucosal lining, so there's a lot of mucus there. And if we were to look really closely, what we'd find is that there are little hairy-like cellular processes that we call microvilli that are able to push things along the digestive tract. The microbiota reside everywhere along the lumen of the digestive tract, starting at the mouth and all the way to the other end. And they reside within those microvilli and they reside within the lumen. And if we were to look really closely at the bumps and grooves along the digestive tract, what we would find is that there are little niches, little areas in which particular things can grow and reside best. Now, that might sound kind of gross, but it actually is a good thing, especially what's growing and residing there are microbacterial organisms that are good for your gut and that signal good things to your brain. And we will talk about what that signaling looks like and how that's done and accomplished in just a few moments. But I want you to get a clear mental picture of your gut, something that we don't often see. And often when we think about the gut, again, we just think about the hollow of the stomach, food going in there, and getting digested, but it's far more complex and actually far more interesting than that. Now, I've been referring to the gut microbiome and to the microbiota and these bacteria. Let me define those terms a little bit more specifically just to avoid any confusion. The microbiota are the actual bacteria. The microbiome is used to refer to the bacteria but also all the genes as bacteria make, because it turns out that they make some important genes that actually impact all of us. You have loads and loads of these little microbiota, these bacteria. In fact, right now you are carrying with you about two to three kilograms, so that's more than six pounds, of these microbiota, these bacteria. And if we were to look at them under a microscope, what we would see is these are relatively simple little organisms. Some remain stationary so they might plop down into the mucosal lining or they might hang out on a particular microvilli or they might be in one of those little niches, and others can move about, but they basically fill the entire lumen. They surround and kind of coat the surface of the microvilli and they're tucked up into any of those little niches that are available to them to tuck into. If you were to take the head of a pin and look at it under the microscope, you could fit many, many hundreds, if not thousands or more of these little microbacteria. And the reason I say many, many thousands or more, I'm giving a kind of broad range there, is that they do vary in size and, again, they vary as to whether or not they can move or they don't move. Now, they're constantly turning over in your gut, meaning they're being born so to speak and they're dying off. And some will stay there for very long periods of time within your gut and others will get excreted. About 60% of your stool, as unpleasant as that might be to think about, is made up of live and dead microbacteria. So you're constantly making and excreting these microbacteria. And which microbacteria you make and how many stay inside your gut and how many leave, meaning how many are excreted, depends a lot on the chemistry of your gut and depends very strongly on the foods that you eat and the foods that you do not eat. Now, just because what we eat strongly influences our microbiome, meaning our microbacteria, does not mean that there are not other influences on what constitutes our microbiome. Our microbiome is also made up by microbacteria that access our digestive tract through our mouth, through breathing, through kissing, and through skin contact. In fact, one of the major determinants of our microbiome is who we interact with and the environment that we happen to be in. And that actually includes whether or not we interact with animals. In a little bit, I'll talk about some data as to whether or not you grew up in a home that had animals, whether or not you grew up in the home, whether or not there was a lot of social contact, meaning skin contact, or whether or not you grew up in a more animal sparse, contact sparse environment and how that shapes your microbiome. But the simple point is that what you eat influences your microbiome, but also what you do, what you think, and what you feel, and many of the low microbacteria that get into your digestive tract do so by way of social interactions. In fact, if you ask a neurobiologist what the role of the microbiome is, they'll tell you almost certainly that it's there to impact brain function. But if you have friends that are microbiologists, such as I do, they'll tell you, well, maybe the brain and nervous system are there to support the microbiome. It's the other way around. You have all these little microorganisms that are taking residence in our body. They don't really know what they're doing as far as we know. We don't know that they have consciousness or they don't. We can't rule that out, but it seems pretty unlikely. Nonetheless, they are taking advantage of the different environments all along your digestive tract. They are taking advantage of the sorts of social interactions, for instance, the people you talk to and that breathe on you, the people that you shake hands with, the people that you kiss or don't kiss, the people that you happen to be romantically involved with or not, your dog, your cat, your lizard, your rat, whatever pet you happen to own is impacting your microbiome. There's absolutely no question about that. So hopefully now you have some sense of the architecture of the digestive pathway and you have some sense of the trillions of little microbacteria that are living all along the different components of that digestive pathway. But what we haven't talked about yet, and what I'd like to talk about now, is what those little microbiota are actually doing in your digestive tract. In addition to just living there for their own intents and purposes, they are contributing, for instance, to your digestion. Many of the genes that those microbiota make are genes that are involved in fermentation and genes that are involved in digestion of particular types of nutrients. And in a little bit, we will talk about how what you eat can actually change the enzymes that those microbiome components make, enzymes largely being things that are responsible for digestion. They catalyze other sorts of cellular events but in the context of the digestive pathway, we're talking about enzymes that help digest your food. So those microbiota are indeed helping you in many ways. And if you lack certain microbiota that can help you digest, it stands to reason that you would have challenges digesting certain types of foods. The other amazing thing that these microbiota do is they change the way that your brain functions by way of metabolizing or facilitating the metabolism of particular neurotransmitters. So one of the ways that having certain microbiota present in your gut can improve your mood or degrade your mood, for instance, is by way of certain microbiota being converted into or facilitating the conversion of chemicals, such as GABA. GABA is what we call an inhibitory neurotransmitter. It's involved in suppressing the action of other neurons. And that might sound like a bad thing, but all types of sedatives, for instance, alcohol, and a lot of neurons that naturally make GABA can help quiet certain circuits in the brain, for instance, circuits responsible for anxiety. In people who have epilepsy, the GABAergic neurons, as they're called, can all often be disrupted in their signaling, meaning they're not cranking out as much GABA and therefore the excitatory neurons, which typically release other molecules like glutamate can engage in what's called runaway excitation and that can give rise to seizures. So the simple message here is that the microbiota by way of making neurochemicals can influence the way that your brain functions. So you want to support those microbiota and we will give you tools to support those microbiota. But the takeaway at this point is that those microbiota are making things locally to help digest food. Other microbiota are helping to make certain neurotransmitters like GABA, and we'll also talk about dopamine and serotonin. And so the very specific microbiota that reside in your gut have a profound influence on many, many biological functions, especially immune system function, brain function, and digestion. So that should give you a fairly complete picture of your gut microbiome. Now I'd like to talk about how your microbiome and your brain communicate, or more accurately, how your microbiome and the rest of your nervous system communicate. Neurons, which simply means nerve cells, are the cells that do most of the heavy lifting in your nervous system. There are of course other cell types that are important. Glial cell, for instance, very, very important cell types. You have endothelial cells, which are responsible for blood flow, pericytes and other types of cells, but the neurons are really doing most of the heavy lifting for most of the things we think about in terms of nervous system function. You have neurons in your gut and that should not surprise you. Neurons reside in your brain, your spinal cord, your eyes, in fact, all over your body, and you've got them on your heart and in your heart, and you've got them in your lungs, and you've got them in your spleen, and they connect to all the different organs and tissues of your body. So that's not surprising that you have neurons in your gut. What is surprising, however, is the presence of particular types of neurons that reside near or in the mucosal lining just next to that lumen of the gut and that are paying attention, and I'll explain what I mean by paying attention, to the components of the gut, both the nutrients and the microbiota, and thereby can send signals up to the brain by way of a long wire that we call an axon, and can communicate what the chemistry and what the nutritional quality and what the other aspects of the environment are at the gut at a given location up to the brain in ways that can influence the brain to, for instance, seek out more of a particular food. Let me give you a sort of action-based picture of this. Let's say like most people, you enjoy sweet foods. I don't particularly enjoy sweet foods but there are a few that I like. I'm a sucker for a really good dark chocolate or really good ice cream or I got this thing for donuts that seems to just not quit although I don't tend to indulge it very often, I do like them. If I eat that particular food, obviously digestion starts in the mouth. There are enzymes there, it gets chewed up, the food goes down into the gut. These neurons are activated, meaning that causes the neurons to be electrically active when particular components, certain nutrients in those foods are present. And for the cell types, or I should say the neuron types that matter here, the nutrients that really trigger their activation are sugar, fatty acids, and amino acids. Now, these particular neurons have the name enteroendocrine cells but more recently they've been defined as neuropod cells. Neuropod cells were discovered by Diego Bohorquez's lab at Duke University. This is a phenomenal set of discoveries made mostly in the last 10 years. These neuropod cells, as I mentioned, are activated by sugar, fatty acids, or amino acids, but have a particularly strong activation to sugars. They do seem to be part of the sweet sensing system. And even though I'm focusing on this particular example, they represent a really nice example of how a particular set of neuro cells in our gut is collecting information about what is there at a particular location in the gut, and sending that information up to our brain. Now, they do that by way of a nerve pathway called the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve is part of the peripheral nervous system. And the vagus nerve is a little bit complex to describe if you're just listening to this. If you are watching this, I'll try and use my hands as a diagram but really the best thing to do if you want really want to learn neuroanatomy is to just imagine it in your mind as best you can and if you can track down a picture of it, terrific, but here's how it works. Neurons have a cell body that we call a soma, that's where all the DNA are contained. That's where a lot of the operating machinery of the cells are contained and a lot of the instructions for that cell of what to be and how to operate are contained. The cell bodies of these neurons or the relevant neurons are actually up near the neck. So you can think of them as a clump of grapes, 'cause cell bodies tend to be round or oval-ish. And then they send a process that we call an axon in one direction out to the gut and they'll send another process up into the brain. And that little cluster near the neck that's relevant here is called the nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E. The nodose ganglion is a little cluster of neurons on either side of the neck. It has a process that goes out to the gut and a process that goes up into the brain. And again, these are just one component of the so-called vagus nerve. The vagus nerve has many, many branches, not just to the gut. There are also branches to the liver, branches to the lungs, branches to the heart, branches to the larynx, and even to the spleen, and other areas of the body that are important. But right now we're just concentrating on the neurons that are in the gut that signal up to the brain. And what the Bohorquez lab has shown is that these neuropod cells are part of network. They're sensing several different nutrients, but in particular, when they sense sugar, they send signals in the form of electrical firing up to the brain in ways that trigger activation of other brain stations that cause you to seek out more of that particular food. Now, this brings us to some classic experiments that at least to me are incredible. And these are highly reproducible findings showing, for instance, that even if you bypass taste by infusing sweet liquid or putting sweet foods into the gut, and people can never taste them with their mouth, people will seek out more of that particular food. And if you give them the option to have a sweet food infused into their gut or a bitter food infused into their gut or a sweet versus sour, or a more sweet versus less sweet food, people have a selective preference for sweet foods even if they can't taste them. Now, this is important to understand in the context of gut-brain signaling because we always think that we like sweet foods because of the way they taste. And indeed that's still true, but much of what we consider the great taste of a sweet food also has to do with a gut sensation that is below our conscious detection. How do we know that? Well, the Bohorquez lab has performed experiments using modern methods and they're classic experiments showing that animals and humans will actively seek out more of a particular sweet food even if it bypasses this taste system. And the reverse is also true. There have been experiments done in animals and in humans that have allowed animals or humans to select and eat sweet foods, and indeed that's what they do if they're given the option. And yet to somehow eliminate the activation of these neurons within the gut that can sense sweet foods. Now, there are a couple different ways that those experiments ave been done. In classic experiments that date back to the '80s, this was done by what's called subdiaphragmatic vagotomy. So this means cutting off the branch of the vagus that enervates the gut below the diaphragm so that the other organs can still function because the vagus is very important, but basically cutting off the sweet sensing in the gut, still giving people the opportunity to taste sweet foods with their mouth, and they don't actively seek out quite as much of the sweet food when they don't have this gut sensing mechanism that we now know to be dependent on these neuropod cells. More recent experiments involve selective silencing of these neuropod cells. And there have been a lot of different derivations of this sort of thing, but the takeaway from it is that our experience of and our desire for particular foods has everything to do with how those foods taste. It also has to do, as you probably know, with their texture and the sensation of those foods in our mouth, and even indeed how they go down our throat sometimes can be very pleasing or very unpleasant. And it also has to do with this subconscious processing of taste that occurs in the gut itself. And again, when I say gut, I don't just mean in the stomach. There are actually neurons, neuropod cells, further down your digestive tract which are signaling to your brain about the presence of sweet foods, as well as foods such as amino acid rich foods or foods that are rich in particular types of fatty acids signaling up to your brain and causing you to seek out more of those foods or to consume more of those foods. Now, you're probably asking, what is the signal? How does it actually make me want more of those foods without me realizing it? Well, it does that by adjusting the release of particular neuromodulators. For those of you that are not familiar with neuromodulators, these are similar to neurotransmitters, but they tend to act more broadly. They tend to impact many more neurons all at once and they go by names like dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, epinephrine, and so forth. Sometimes people refer to those as neurotransmitters. Technically they are neuromodulators. I'll refer to them almost always as neuromodulators. The neuropod cells signal by way of a particular branch of the vagus through that nodose ganglion that we talked about before and through a number of different stations in the brain stem, eventually cause the release of the neuromodulator dopamine. Dopamine is often associated with a sense of pleasure and reward but it is more appropriately thought of as a neuromodulator that impacts motivation, craving, and pursuit. It tends to put us into modes of action, not necessarily running and moving through space, although it can do that too, but in the context of feeding, it tends to make us look around more, chew more, reach for things more, and seek out more of whatever it is that's giving us that sensation of delight or satisfaction. And again, that sense of delight and satisfaction, you might experience only consciously as the way that something tastes on your mouth but it actually is caused again by both the sensations in your mouth but also by the activation of these neuropod cells. So this is an incredible system of gut-brain signaling, and it is but one system of gut-brain signaling. It turns out it's the system that we know the most about at this point in time. There are other components of gut-brain signaling that we'll talk about in a moment, for instance, the serotonin system. But in terms of examples of gut-brain signaling for which we know a lot of the individual elements and how they work, I think this neuropod, neuron sensing of sweet foods, fatty acids, and amino acids in the gut and communicating that up to the brain by way of the vagus and causing us to seek out more of the foods that deliver those nutrients is an incredible pathway that really delineates the beauty and the power of this gut-brain axis. Let me talk about timescales. Here I'm talking about a particular type of neuron that is signaling up to the brain using electrical signals to cause us to want to seek out a particular category of foods. That's happening relatively fast compared to the hormone pathways of the gut which also involve neurons. So your gut is also communicating to your brain by way of neurons, nerve cells. But some of those nerve cells also release hormones. And those hormones go by names like CCK, glucagon-like peptide 1, PYY, et cetera. A good example of a hormone pathway, or what's sometimes called a hormone peptide pathway, that is similar to the pathway I've talked about before but a little bit slower is the ghrelin pathway. Ghrelin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N, increases with fasting. So the longer it's been since you've eaten, or if you're just eating very little food compared to your caloric needs, ghrelin levels are going to go up in your bloodstream and they go up because of processes that include processes within the gut and include the nervous system. So it's a slow pathway driving you to seek out food generally. As far as we know, the ghrelin system is not partial to seeking out of sweet foods or fatty foods or so on. Ghrelin increases the longer it's been since you've eaten sufficient calories and it stimulates a feeling of you wanting to seek out food. Well, how does it do that? It does that again by impacting neural circuits within the brain, neural circuits that include what we call the brain stem autonomic center. So it tends to make you feel alert and quite, we say, high levels of autonomic arousal. If you haven't eaten in a while, you might think that you just get really exhausted, right? Because we all hear that food is energy and caloric energy is what we need to burn, but you actually have a lot of energy stored in your body that you would be able to use if you really needed energy. But typically if we haven't eaten in a while, we start to get agitated and we get agitated by way way of release of the neuromodulator epinephrine, which causes us to look around more, move around more, and seek out food. That all occurs in brain stem autonomic centers and in the hypothalamus. We did an entire episode on feeding behavior and metabolism as well and you can find those episodes at hubermanlab.com so I don't want to go into a lot of detail about hypothalamic and brains stem centers. But there's a particular area of the brain called the nucleus of the solitary tract, the NST as it's called, that's very strongly impacted by these circulating hormones and tends to drive us toward feeding behavior. So the important point here is that we have a fast system that is paying attention to the nutrients in our gut or the absence of nutrients in our gut, and stimulating us to seek out food or to stop eating certain foods, and we have a slower hormone-related system that also originates in the gut and impacts the brain. But all of those converge on neural circuits for feeding. The neural circuits for feeding include things like the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, they include a bunch of other neurochemicals, but the point is that you've got a fast route and a slow route to drive you to eat more or eat less, right, to seek out food and consume it or to stop eating, to essentially kickstart the satiety mechanisms as they're called, and those are operating in parallel. It's not like one happens first then stops then the other. They're always operating in parallel. And I bring this up because there's a bigger theme here which we see over and over again in biology, which is the concept of parallel pathways. You've always got multiple accelerators and multiple brakes on a system. It's very, very rare to have just one accelerator and one brake on the system. And this will become important later when we talk about tools for optimizing your gut microbiome for healthy eating and for health healthy digestion and for healthy brain function. I want to take a moment and talk about glucagon-like peptide 1, which is also called GLP-1. GLP-1 is made by neurons in the gut and by neurons in the brain. This is a fairly recent discovery but it's an important one. GLP-1 tends to inhibit feeding and tends to reduce appetite. There are a number of drugs released on the market now, one for instance goes by the name semaglutide, which is essentially an GLP-1 agonist. It causes the release of more GLP-1. It's being used to treat type II diabetes, which is insulin resistant diabetes. This is different than type I diabetes where people don't actually make insulin. It's also being used as a drug to reduce obesity. And it seems pretty effective at least in certain populations. There are certain foods and substances that increase GLP-1. I've talked about a few of these on the podcast. One that I'm a particular fan of for entirely other reasons is yerba mate tea can stimulate the release of GLP-1. In South America, it's often used as an appetite suppressant, probably in large part because of its effect on GLP-1 release, but probably also because it does contain caffeine, which is a bit of a stimulant, which also can be involved in lipolysis, which is the utilization of fat stores for energy and so forth. A brief mention about yerba mate. There are some reports out there that yerba mate can increase certain types of cancers. The data that I've seen on this is that it tends to relate to whether or not those are smoked versions of the yerba mate tea, the amount of consumption, and the debate is still out. So I invite you to look at those papers. You can search for those online. Nonetheless, yerba mate is one source of GLP-1 stimulation. Semaglutide is another source. It also can be stimulated by various foods, nuts, avocados, eggs, and so forth. Certain high fiber complex grains will also stimulate GLP-1. I raise this as not necessarily a route that you want to take in order to reduce food intake. I don't even know that that's your goal. But that GLP-1 is another one of these gut-to-brain signaling mechanisms that adjusts appetite that is dependent on diet, depends on what you eat or drink, and that the GLP-1 pathway does seem particularly sensitive to the constituents of diet. There's at least one quality study I was able to find showing that the ketogenic diet for instance, which almost always involves ingestion of very low levels of carbohydrate can increase GLP-1. Although, as I mentioned before, there are other foods that fall outside the range of what we would consider ketogenic that can also stimulate GLP-1, and as I mentioned, there are prescription drugs, like semaglutide, there are other ones as well now, that stimulate GLP-1. So how does GLP-1 reduce appetite? It does that, in part, by changing the activity of neurons in the hypothalamus, this cluster of neurons just above the roof of our mouth, that themselves make GLP-1 and that cause the activation of motor circuits for reaching, chewing, all the things that we associate with feeding behavior. So I use GLP-1 as an example of a pathway that you might choose to tap into by ingestion of yerba mate or by ingestion of the foods I mentioned, or if it's something that interests you, ketogenic diet. But I also mention it simply because it's another beautiful example of how a hormone pathway can impact the activity of brain circuits that are directly involved in a particular behavior. So yet another example of how gut is communicating to brain in order to change what we think we want or to change what our actual behaviors are. So the next time you find yourself reaching for food, or you find yourself wanting a particular sweet thing or fatty thing or something that contains a lot of amino acids, a protein rich food, keep in mind that that's not just about the taste of the food, and it's not even necessarily about the nutrients that you need or don't need. It could be, but it's also about this subconscious signaling that's coming from your body all the time, waves of hormones, waves of nerve cell signals, electrical signals that are changing the way that your brain works. And this raises for me a memory of the episode that I did with Dr. Robert Sapolsky, who's a world expert colleague of mine at Stanford, who is expert on things like hormones and behavior. But we got into the topic of free will, which is a bit of a barbed wire topic as many of you know. It gets into the realm of philosophy, et cetera. And we were kind of batting back and forth the idea, I was saying, \\\"Well, I think there's free will, and can't there certainly be free will or certainly the idea that we can avoid certain choices?\\\" And Robert was saying, \\\"No.\\\" In fact, he said, \\\"Nah,\\\" he doesn't believe that we have any free will. He thinks that events in our brain are determined by biological events that are below our conscious detection and that occur seconds to milliseconds before we make decisions or assessments and, therefore, we just can't control what we do, what we think, and what we feel. And at the time I sort of didn't buy it. I thought, I don't know. I just, I guess I really wanted to believe in free will. And to some extent I still do but as we talk about how these neurons in our gut and these hormones in our gut are influencing our brain and the decisions that we are making, at the level of circuits, like the hypothalamus and the nucleus of the solitary tract, these are areas of the brain way below our frontal cortex and our conscious perception. Think these are examples that really fall in favor of what Dr. Sapolsky was arguing, which is that events that are happening within our body are actually changing the way our brain works. So we might think that we want the cupcake. We might think that we don't need to eat something or do need to eat something and that is entirely on the basis of prior knowledge and decision-making that we're making with our head, but in fact, it's very clear to me based on the work from the Bohorquez lab, classic work over the years dating back to the '80s, and indeed back to the '50s that we'll talk about in a moment, that our body is shaping the decisions that our brain is making and we're not aware of it at all. Now, the good news is that whether or not you believe in free will or not, the simple knowledge that this whole process is happening can perhaps be a benefit to you. You can perhaps leverage it to get some insight and understanding and perhaps even a wedge into your own behavior. You might think, ah, I think I want that particular food, or I think I want to avoid that particular food, but actually that's not a decision that I'm making on a purely rational basis. Has a lot to do with what my gut is telling my brain. So we've largely been talking about chemical communication between the gut and the brain. Chemical because even though these neuropod cells are communicating with the brain by way of electrical activity, what we call action potentials, and in neural language we call those spikes, spikes of action potentials, spikes of action potentials, meaning those neural signals, cause the release of chemicals in the brain like dopamine. So it's chemical transmission. Similarly, hormones, even though they act more slowly, hormones like neuropeptide Y like CCK, like ghrelin, they are signaling chemically. They're moving through the body, they're going in there affecting the chemical output of different cells, and they're changing the chemistry of those cells and the chemistry of the cells that those cells talk to. So that gives us one particular category of signaling from gut to brain, which is chemical signaling. But of course there are other forms of signals and those fall under the category of mechanical signaling. You're probably familiar with this. If you've ever eaten a very large meal or consumed a lot of fluid, you experience that as distension of the gut and that doesn't just have to be distension of the stomach, but distension of your intestines as well. That distension is registered by neurons that reside in your gut, the signals go up to your brain, and communicate with areas of the brain that are responsible for suppressing further consumption of food and/or fluid, and, under certain circumstances, can also be associated with the activation of neural circuits that cause vomiting or the desire to vomit. So if ever you've eaten too much or you've eaten something that doesn't agree with you, that information is communicated by way of mechanosensors that sense the mechanics of your gut, possibly also the chemistry of your gut, but mostly the mechanics of your gut, signal up to the brain, and activate brain centers that are involved in stopping the eating behavior, and activation of an area of the brain stem that is affectionately referred to as the vomit center among neuroanatomists. This is a area that more appropriately is called the chemoreceptor trigger zone, the CTZ, or area postrema and neurons in this area actually will trigger the vomiting reflex. So the way that the gut and the brain communicate is both chemical and mechanical, and it can be both for sake of increasing certain types of behavior. Today, we're talking mainly about feeding behavior up until now anyway but also ceasing to eat, closing your mouth, moving away from food, turning away from food, all behaviors that we're familiar with anytime we feel kind of sick on the basis of activation of this mechanosensor for gastric distress. So we've got chemical signaling and mechanical signaling. And I also want to emphasize that we have direct and indirect signaling from the gut to the brain. Direct signaling is the kind of signaling of the sort I've been talking about mainly up until now, which is neurons in the gut communicating with neurons in the brain stem that communicate with neurons in the hypothalamus. And, of course, those are also going to interact with neurons of the prefrontal cortex which is the area of a brain involved in decision making the, you know, I think it was the shrimp that made me sick. I'm going to, I just don't want any more of that. Or I'm never going back to that restaurant again because after I ate there about an hour later, I started feeling really not well. I felt, you know, kind of feverish, but my gut didn't feel well, my digestion was really off. All of that kind of information is handled in the prefrontal cortex at a conscious level, but the immediate decision to stop eating or to eat more of something to move towards something or away from it, that's made by neural circuits that reside at the, we would say, the subconscious level but what we really mean is below the level of the neocortex. Below the cortex means essentially below our level of conscious awareness. So we talked about two types of information within the gut that are communicated to the brain, chemical information, meaning information about the nutrients that happen to be there, and mechanical information, distention of the gut or lack of distention and so forth. And we talked about how these neuropod cells can signal the release of dopamine and circuits within the brain to cause you to seek out more of something. Now, in a very logically consistent way, dopamine is also involved in the whole business of vomiting. You might think, well, that doesn't make any sense. I thought dopamine was always a good thing. It's involved in moderation and reward, et cetera. But it turns out the area postrema, this vomit center in the brain stem, is chockablock full of dopamine receptors. And if dopamine levels go too high, it can actually trigger vomiting. And this we see in the context of various drugs that are used to treat things like Parkinson's. Parkinson's is a deficiency in dopamine or a lack of dopamine neurons typically that causes a resting tremor, difficulty in movement, because dopamine's also associated with a lot of the neural circuits for movement. Many drugs that are used to treat Parkinson's like L-DOPA increase levels of dopamine so much, or at least activate dopamine receptors to such a great degree in certain areas of the brain that they can cause activation of things like the trigger to vomit. Now, this should also make sense in the natural context of if you gorge yourself with food, gorge yourself with food, gorge yourself with food, the neurons in your gut that respond to that are simply detecting the presence of nutrients but they don't really make decisions themselves. They don't know to stop eating. Your brain knows to stop eating or to eject that food. And so it's a wonderful thing that those neurons are communicating with areas of the brain not just that stimulate consuming more food but that are communicating with areas of the brain, for instance, area postrema, that when dopamine levels get too high, cause us to either stop eating that food or in the case of vomiting to eject that food. So I raise this not to give you a kind of a disgusting counterexample to what we call appetitive behaviors, the things that we like to do more of, but simply to give you a sense of just how strongly even these reflexes that we think of as feeling sick and vomiting or the desire to seek out more food are really being controlled by a kind of push-pull system, by parallel pathways that are arriving from our gut and the same neurochemicals, in this case dopamine, are being used to create two opposite type behaviors, one behavior to consume more, one behavior to get rid of everything you've already consumed. So our brain is actually sensitive to the amount of signaling coming from our gut not just the path by which that signal arrives. Our brain is very carefully paying attention to whether or not the levels of dopamine that are being triggered are within a normal range for typical eating behavior or whether or not we've gorged ourselves to the point where enough already. Now, of course, mechanical signals will also play into area postrema and into the vomiting reflex. If we have a very distended gut, we feel lousy. It just, it actually can hurt very badly, and we will have the desire to vomit, or we will just simply vomit. Mechanical and chemical signals are always arriving in parallel. They never work in unison. And so now we have chemical signals, mechanical signals, and now I'd like to talk about direct and indirect signals because almost everything I've talked about up until now are direct signals, a neural pathway that converges in the brain to create a particular feeling, thought, or behavior, but there are also indirect pathways. And that's what takes us back to the gut microbiome and to these little microbiota. And to just give you the takeaway message at the front here and then I'll give you a little more detail as to how it comes about, you have neurotransmitters in your brain and in your spinal cord and in your eyes and in your peripheral nervous system. They cause the activation or the suppression of nerve activity, meaning they either electrically activate other nerve cells or they cause other nerve cells to be less electrically active. And they do that by way of neurotransmitters. But as it turns out, the gut microbiota are capable of influencing metabolic events and in some cases are capable of synthesizing neurotransmitters themselves. So what that means is that these little bugs, these little microbiota that are cargo in your gut, the six pounds of cargo, they actually can make neurochemicals that can pass into the bloodstream and into your brain and actually impact the other cells of your body and brain indirectly, so without involving these very intricate nerve pathways that we've been talking about. In other words, the foods you eat, the environment of your gut microbiome, can actually create the chemical substrates that allow your brain to feel one way or the other, to feel great or to feel lousy, to seek out more of a particular type of behavior or to avoid that behavior. And that would constitute indirect signaling. So I've been talking a lot about the structure and function of the gut-to-brain pathway, focusing mainly on feeding behaviors and in some cases avoiding feeding or even ejecting food from the digestive tract, I'd like to drill a little bit deeper into this indirect signaling pathway from the gut to the brain because it bridges us nicely from neuronal signals in the gut to the brain, hormonal signals from the gut to the brain, to what also includes the microbiome, which is what we started talking about at the beginning of the episode. As I mentioned a couple of minutes ago, certain gut microbiota can actually synthesize certain neurotransmitters that can go impact the brain. And we actually have some knowledge about which microbiota can synthesize particular neurotransmitters. For instance, the neuromodulator dopamine can be synthesized by or from bacillus and serratia. Now, these are just names of microbiota. I don't expect that any of you would necessarily recognize them. These aren't the sorts of things that you necessarily would run out and buy to get more dopamine. But the point is that particular gut microbiota can create dopamine in our gut that can get into our bloodstream and can generally change our baseline levels of dopamine within the brain and other areas of the body. I mentioned baseline levels of dopamine because as I talked about on an episode all about dopamine but I'll just repeat the basics here now, we have baseline levels of transmitters or neuromodulators that act as sort of the level of the tide, the overall level, and then we can have peaks of dopamine that are created by behaviors or by ingestion of particular foods or drugs, et cetera. So bacillus and serratia tend to increase our baseline levels of dopamine. So if it turns out that we are creating the right gut microbiome environment that these particular gut microbiota can thrive in, well, then our baseline levels of dopamine will be elevated and in general, that leads to enhancement of mood. Similarly, there are other gut microbiota, for instance, candida, streptococus, various enterococcus, these always have these kind of strange and not so attractive names, at least to me as a neurobiologist. Nonetheless, those particular microbiota support the production of or can even be metabolized into serotonin, which is a neuromodulator associated with mood, with social interactions, with a huge number of different types of events and behaviors. Again, these gut microbiota when present and allowed to thrive in our gut will increase our overall levels of serotonin and riding on top of that level of serotonin will be the serotonin that's specifically released in response to certain behaviors. And I really want to drive home this point of baselines and peaks. The baseline level of serotonin might set our overall mood, whether or not we wake up feeling pretty good or really lousy if our serotonin levels happen to be very, very low, whether or not we tend to be in a kind of a calm space or whether or not we tend to be somewhat irritable. But then of course individual events as we go about our day, maybe a compliment that we get or maybe somebody says something irritating to us, whatever it may be will also influence levels of serotonin, but those serotonin events are going to be related to events at particular neural circuits in the brain. And this is an important topic because I think that a lot of people hear quite accurately, oh, 90 to 95% of our serotonin is manufactured in the gut. And indeed that's true. It's manufactured from the sorts of microbiota that I just described. And there are many, many experiments now, mostly in animal models, but also some in humans that show that if the gut microbiome is deficient in some way to these particular bacteria, that serotonin levels drop and people's mood suffers, maybe even their immune system functions, maybe even it exacerbates certain psychiatric illnesses. However, a lot of people take that to mean that the serotonin of the brain all comes from the gut or mostly comes from the gut. That's not the case. It's still the case that you have neurons in the brain that are responsible for releasing serotonin directly in response to certain things like social touch or through other types of positive social experiences. So we've got gut microbiota that can literally be turned into dopamine and raise our baseline levels of dopamine. We've got gut microbiota that can literally raise our baseline levels of serotonin. And indeed there are other gut microbiota like lactobacillus or bifidobacterium, excuse me, hard complex names to pronounce, bifidobacterium that can give rise to increases in GABA levels, this inhibitory neurotransmitter that can act as a little bit of a mild sedative, can reduce irritability, et cetera, but that's just the baseline, the kind of tide of those neuromodulators. Again, I want to emphasize that we still have neurocircuits within the brain and body that are specifically releasing in a very potent way dopamine, serotonin, and GABA. So the two things act in concert. Even though the gut and the brain are acting both in parallel and directly influencing one another, it is a powerful synergistic effect. And there are now hundreds of studies, maybe even thousands by this point, mostly performed in animal models, typically mice, but also some studies in humans that show that creating the correct environment for these gut microbiota to thrive really does enhance mood and wellbeing. And that when our gut microbiome is not healthy, that it really can deplete our mood and sense of wellbeing. Now, there are two major phases to creating a healthy gut microbiome. One you can control and the other one is less under your control. I get into this in a lot of detail in the episode with Dr. Sonnenburg, which is coming out immediately after this one, the following Monday, that is. But for now I want to just capture a few of the main points about the early establishment of the gut microbiome. It turns out that the environment that we are exposed to, the things that come into contact with our skin and digestive tract and any other mucosal lining, even the urethra, the nasal passages, any opening to the outside world that brings in certain, excuse me, certain microbiota in the first three years of life is going to have a profound impact on the overall menu of microbiota that we will be able to carry within our body. And it really does seem that getting exposure to and building a diverse microbiome in those first three years is critical. There's a lot of speculation and some data as to cesarean delivered babies having less diverse microbiomes compared to vaginally delivered babies. There have been attempts, although not conclusive attempts, to link that to the presence of autism spectrum disorders, which at least by some statistics seem to be of higher probability in cesarean deliveries although there are other studies that refute that, and I want to make that clear. However, it's clear that babies do not get much, if any, exposure to microbiota inside of the womb, maybe a little bit, but not much. But that is during the birth process and in the days and weeks immediately after they arrive in the world that their gut microbiome is established, that those gut microbiota take residence within the gut. So it will depend on whether or not they were breastfed or bottle fed. It'll depend on whether or not they were exposed to a household pet or not, whether or not they were held by multiple caregivers or just by one, whether or not they were a preemie baby and were contained in a particularly restrictive environment in order to encourage their further development before they could be brought home or not. I don't want to give the picture that if you were isolated or you were delivered by C-section, that you're somehow doomed to have a poor microbiome. That's simply not the case. However, it is the case that the more diversity of microbiota that one can create early in life is really helpful for long-term outcomes in terms of brain-to-gut signaling, gut-to-brain signaling, and for sake of the immune system. There are some decent studies showing that if children are exposed to a lot of antibiotic treatment early in life, that can be very detrimental to establishment of a healthy gut microbiome. And fortunately that reestablishing a healthy gut microbiome can help rescue some of those deficits. So doctors nowadays are much more cautious about the prescription of antibiotic drugs to children in their early years, not just up to three years, but extending out to five and seven and 10 years. And even in adults, they're very, very careful about that, or they ought to be. One reason is the existence, or I would say, the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria that are becoming more common in hospitals and elsewhere and that can cause serious problems. But in addition to that, because of this understanding that the gut microbiome is influencing and actually creating neurotransmitters that can impact mood and mental health, impact immune health, and so on. As I mentioned earlier, there are hundreds if not thousands of studies emphasizing the key role of the microbiome on brain health, psychiatric health, et cetera. I want to just highlight a few of those studies and in particular, some recent studies that come from labs that have been working on this sort of thing for a very long time. One of the more exciting studies comes from the work of Mauro Costa-Mattioli's lab, which is at Baylor College of Medicine. Mauro's lab has been working on mouse models of autism spectrum disorder for a long time, and looking at social behavior using a mouse model for a long time. And they've been able to identify particular types of microbiota that when they take resonance in the gut can help offset some of the symptoms of autism, at least the symptoms of autism that exist in these mouse models, okay? So again, this is not human work. This is work being done on mouse models for the simple reason that you can do these kinds of manipulations, where basically they took mice that were in germ free-environments or non-germ-free environments, or they exposed mice to particular microbiota and not other microbiota and they discovered that a particular microbiota called L. reuteri, it's L. R-E-U-T-E-R-I. Treatment with L. reuteri corrects the social deficits present in these autism models and it does so by way of activating our old friend the vagus nerve, but not simply because the vagus nerve triggers the release of dopamine, but it turns out that this particular gut microbiota L. reuteri can correct the social deficits in this autism spectrum disorder model. It does that by way of a vagal nerve pathway that stimulates both dopamine release and oxytocin release. And they establish this really mechanistically by showing, for instance, if you get rid of the oxytocin receptor, you don't see this rescue. Now, those are mouse models so we have to take those with the appropriate grain of salt, but they're really exciting. And they come to us in parallel with other studies that are being done, taking the microbiomes of people who have one condition or lack of condition, and putting it into people who have one condition or another condition. Let me explain what I mean by that. The early discovery of the gut microbiome and its potential to impact health was not in the context of the gut-to-brain pathway but rather it was in the context of colitis. This dates back to studies in the '50s, whereby people with very severe intractable colitis for which no other treatment was going to work received fecal transplants. So yes, that's exactly as it sounds. Taking the stool of healthy people who do not have colitis, transplanting those stools into the lower digestive tract of people who do have colitis, and they saw significant improvement, if not rescue of the colitis. That was one of the first indications that something within stool, of all things, could actually rescue another individual from disease, which sounds kind of wild and crazy, and may even sound disgusting to some of you, but as I mentioned at the beginning of the episode, almost 60% of stool is live or dead bacteria, microbiota, and it really opened up this entire field of exploring how different microbiota might have therapeutic effects. And indeed, that has been shown to be the case also in fecal transplants for certain psychiatric illnesses. These are still ongoing studies. They vary in quality. These are hard studies to do for all sorts of reasons, getting the appropriate patient populations, getting agreement, et cetera, making sure that everything's handled properly. But what this involves is fecal transplants from individuals that lack a particular psychiatric condition or metabolic condition into people who have a particular metabolic condition and there has been tremendous success in some cases. One of the more powerful and salient examples is for obesity. There's some people for which even if they ingest very low numbers of calories, even if they go on a liquid protein diet, simply can't lose weight. These are somewhat rare disorders but these are people that would either get gastric bypass surgery. Some people are now getting these fecal transplants from people that have healthy weight and they take the stool from them, they put it into lower digestive tract, and they can see substantial improvement in weight loss in people that were otherwise unable to do that. In some cases, actually they can start eating relatively normal levels of food and still lose weight. So pretty remarkable and that tells us there's something in these microbiota that's really powerful. Now, how those effects are generated isn't clear. One idea is that it's impacting the metabolome, components of the metabolism, almost certainly that's going to be the case. Another idea is that it's impacting neurotransmitters which change behavior and food choices within the brain. Although, as I mentioned, some of these people are already eating very little food to begin with so that's a little bit harder of an argument to create. There are also some somewhat famous examples now of how fecal transplants can lead to negative outcomes. But those negative outcomes further underscore the power of the microbiome in impacting bodily health. One key example of this, for instance, is transfer of fecal matter into another person in order to treat something like colitis and it effectively does that, but if the donor of the stool, of the fecal matter happened to be obese or have some other metabolic syndrome, it's been observed that the recipient can also develop that metabolic syndrome simply by way of receiving that donor's particular microbiota. So these microbiota can create positive outcomes or they can create negative outcomes. Now, most of us of course, are not interested in or pursuing fecal transplants. Most people are interested in just creating a healthy gut microbiome environment for sake of immune system and brain function. And we will talk about how to do that in just a few minutes. But I just want to further underscore the power of the microbiota in shaping brain chemistry and in shaping things like mood or other aspects of mental health that typically we don't associate with our gut. There are several studies published in recent years, one that I'll just highlight now, first author is Tonya Nguyen, N-G-U-Y-E-N. The title of the paper is \\\"Association of Loneliness and Wisdom with Gut Microbial Diversity and Composition, an Exploratory Study\\\". It's an interesting study. Looked at 184 community dwelling adults, excuse me, ranging from 28 to 97 years old. They explored whether or not having enhanced microbial diversity somehow related to these variables that they refer to as loneliness and wisdom. They used a number of different tests to evaluate those. Those are common tests in the psychology literature, not so much in the biology literature, but nonetheless, there are ways of measuring things like loneliness and wisdom, wisdom in this case, being the opposite of loneliness, at least in the context of this study. And what they found was the more microbial diversity, the more diverse one's microbiome was, the lower incidence of loneliness. And they did this by taking fecal samples, profiling them for RNA. So essentially doing gene sequencing of the stool of these individuals, getting ratings of how lonely or not lonely they felt, and correlating those. And that's just but one study. I point it out because it's particularly recent and it looked like it was particularly well done. There is another study that I'll just refer you to. This was a study published in 2020 in \\\"Scientific Reports\\\". The title of the study is \\\"Emotional Wellbeing and Gut Microbiome Profiles by Enterotype\\\". What I particularly like about this study is that they were able to correlate the presence of certain microbiota with feelings of subjective wellbeing and lack of or presence of depressive symptoms. They did high-throughput gene sequencing of the microbiomes of individuals. So that meant measuring the microbiota, figuring out which microbiota were present, how diverse their microbiome was in general. Gut microbiome diversity is a good thing. And then to correlate that with what's called the PANAS score. PANAS stands for positive affect negative affect schedule. This is a test that my lab has used extensively, that other labs to use to evaluate mood and wellbeing. And they defined what were called three enterotypes, three different categories of people that ate very different diets that tended to fall into categories of having more or fewer emotional symptoms that were negative or more fewer emotional symptoms that were positive and whether or not they tend to be more depressed, anxious, or have more stress-related behaviors, et cetera. And what they were able to derive from this study was some strong indications about what types of things we should ingest in our diet, maybe even certain things that we should avoid, but certainly the types of things that we should ingest, that can enhance mood and wellbeing and can tend to shift people away from more depressive-like anxiety and stress-related symptoms. Before we get into what the particular food items were that lend themselves to a healthy microbiome, I want to raise a bigger and perhaps more important issue, which is what is a healthy microbiome. I think if you asked any number of world experts, and I certainly ask this of Dr. Sonnenburg, what is a healthy microbiome, they're all going to tell you it's a microbiome that has a lot of diversity, that includes a lot of different types of bacteria. And that makes sense because it logically would include the bacteria that produce GABA and dopamine and serotonin, and that support the immune system, and do a number of different things. But is it simply the case that adding microbiota diversity is always a good thing? Well, that doesn't seem to be the case. Probiotics and prebiotics, both of which can enhance microbiotal diversity, can improve mood, digestion, immune system, and so on. That's been established but it's mainly been established in the context of post-antibiotic treatment or people that are recovering from illness or people that have been very stressed or have been dealing with all sorts of challenges, mental or physical, and they are an attempt to replenish the gut microbiome. However, it's also clear that excessive microbiota brought about by excessive intake of probiotics can lead to things like brain fog. There's actually some good studies that point to the fact that certain metabolites of the microbiome, certain chemicals produced in the gut and in the body can actually lead to brain fog states. This is thought to come about through the lactate pathways of the gut that can then impact the brain. If you want to look more into this issue of whether or not probiotics taken in excess perhaps can lead to brain fog, I'd encourage you to look at a particular paper. This is a paper published in \\\"Clinical and Translational Gastroenterology\\\". And the title of the paper is \\\"Brain Fogginess, Gas, and Bloating, a Link Between SIBO Probiotics and Metabolic Acidosis\\\". It was published in 2018. We can provide a link to this study. And there are several other studies in the references that point to the fact that in some cases, excessive intake of probiotics and excessive proliferation of gut microbiota can actually be problematic. I mention this not to confuse you but because it is confusing out there. We all would think that just increasing microbiotal diversity is always a good thing but there are thresholds beyond which excessive microbiotal diversity might be problematic. I think everyone agrees that having too few microbial species living in us is not a good idea. Now, none of that answers the questions that I think everyone really wants answers to, which are, what should we do, what should we not do to improve our gut microbiome? I mean, clearly we can't time travel back to when we were zero to three years old and get a dog if we didn't have a dog, get breastfed if we weren't breastfed, be delivered vaginally as opposed to by C-section if we didn't have that opportunity. We just can't time travel and do that. All of us, however, should be seeking to improve the conditions of our gut microbiome because of the critical ways in which it impacts the rest of our brain and bodily health. So what should we do, what shouldn't we do? Clearly we know that stress can negatively impact the gut microbiome. However, some forms of stress that can quote unquote negatively impact the microbiome include fasting, long periods of fasts, which makes sense because a lot of microbiota need food in order to thrive. In fact, many if not all of them do at some point. There are other questions such as should we eat particular foods and how often should we eat those foods? We've all been told that fiber is incredibly important because of the presence of prebiotic fiber, which can essentially feed the microbiome, but is fiber really necessary and how necessary is it to encourage a healthy microbiome? Clearly, there are a number of people following relatively low fiber diets, such as ketogenic diets, and those can have, in some cases, anti-inflammatory effects and can sometimes also improve certain microbiota species. So it can all be rather confusing. And for that matter, I asked our resident expert, Dr. Justin Sonnenburg at Stanford, all of these questions. And he answers them very systematically in the episode that comes out after this one. But I don't want to withhold anything from you so I'll just give a very top contour version of those answers and then you'll get more in-depth answers during that episode. I asked about fasting. And the reason I asked about fasting is that years ago, I was at a meeting as part of the Pew Biomedical Scholars Meeting and one of the other Pew Biomedical Scholars was an expert in gut microbiome and I said, \\\"Hey, are probiotics good for the microbiome? And if so, which ones should I take?\\\" And his answer was very interesting. He said, \\\"You know, in certain cases they can be, especially if you're traveling or you're stressed, but it turns out that the particular bacteria that they put in most probiotics don't actually replenish the microbiota that you need most.\\\" And I thought, \\\"Oh, well, why don't they make ones that replenish the microbiota that you need most?\\\" And his answer was, \\\"Well, they don't replenish those but they replenish other ones that then in turn encourage the development of the microbiota that you do want once you start eating the appropriate foods. So they change the environment which makes the environment better, which indirectly supports the proliferation of quote unquote good microbiota.\\\" Okay, so that was a somewhat convoluted answer but I did appreciate his answer. Then I asked him about fasting. I said, \\\"Well, a lot of people are getting interested in intermittent fasting now. People are spending a significant portion of each 24-hour cycle avoiding food for sake of time restrictive feeding. What does that do to the gut microbiome? Does it make it healthier or does it make it unhealthier?\\\" Well, my colleague from Yale and Dr. Sonnenburg both confirmed that during periods of fasting, especially prolonged periods of fasting, we actually start to digest away much of our digestive tract. Now, the whole thing doesn't start to disappear but there's thinning of the mucosal lining or the least disruption of the mucosal lining. A lot of the microbiota species can start to die off. And so it was surprising to me, but nonetheless interesting that fasting may actually cause a disruption to certain healthy elements of the gut microbiome. But again, there's a caveat. The caveat is that when people eat after a period of fast, there may be a compensatory proliferation, meaning an increase in healthy gut microbiota. So you start to get the picture that fasting is neither good nor bad. You start to get the picture that particular diets, meaning certain restriction diets or macronutrient-rich diets may not be good or bad for the microbiome. And yet there are some answers that arrive to us from Dr. Sonnenburg, but from other experts in the field, that there are certain foods and certain things that we can ingest which definitely enhance the microbiome and make it healthier than it would be were we to not ingest those foods. So next I'd like to talk about what I think is a really pioneering and important study in this area. This is a study that was carried out by the Sonnenburg lab in collaboration with Chris Gardner's lab, also at Stanford, where they compared two general types of diets in humans, diets that were fiber rich, which has been proposed time and time again to enhance microbiota diversity and to enhance gut-brain signaling even and to enhance the immune system perhaps, and diets that were enriched in so-called low-sugar fermented foods. Before I dive into that study and what the conclusions were because they are very interesting and very actionable for all of us, I do want to touch on probiotics because I want to avoid confusion. It is not the case that ingestion of probiotics will always lead to brain fog. I want to make that clear. It is the case that ingestion of probiotics, even if those probiotics don't directly contain the microbiota species that one is trying to proliferate, can be useful for improving microbiotal diversity. In general, it seems that maintaining a healthy gut microbiome involves ingesting certain types of foods, and we'll talk about those in a moment, but perhaps also augmenting the microbiota system through prebiotics or probiotics at a fairly low level on a consistent basis. So these are not high dose probiotics except under conditions of dysbiosis where, for instance, if somebody has done a round of antibiotics and they need to replenish their gut microbiome, there are foods and there are pill form and powder form prebiotics and probiotics that can be very useful. Or in cases where people have been very stressed or are undergoing excessive travel or have shifted their diet radically, maybe that's due to travel, maybe that's due to illness, maybe that's due to stress. But when there are a number of different converging events that are stressing or depleting microbiotal diversity, that's when at least I believe it can be useful to support the gut microbiome through the ingestion of quality probiotics or prebiotics. So it would be under conditions where people are stressed or their system is generally stressed for environmental or illness-related reasons that it might be useful to lean towards higher doses of prebiotics or probiotics than one might normally use but that under normal conditions, that one would focus on quality nutrients through diet and focus on ingestion of probiotics at a fairly low to moderate level, and/or prebiotics at a fairly low to moderate level. That just seems like the logical approach based on the experts that I've spoken to. But certainly if your doctor prescribes or suggests that you take high levels of probiotics for any reason, you should definitely pay attention to your physician, and you should obviously pay attention to your physician in any a case. You should never add or remove anything from your nutritional plan or supplementation plan without consulting a physician. So what should we do in order to maximize the health of our gut-brain axis as it's called? How should we support the diversity of the good microbiota that help us create all these neurotransmitters that we want, improve our immune system function, and so on and so forth? Well, some of that is going to be through the basics. When I say the basics, I mean the foundational things that really set us up for overall health. So this is going to be getting deep sleep of sufficient duration 80 plus percent of the time. I mean, if you could get a hundred percent of the time, that'd be great but very few people accomplish that. It's going to be proper hydration. It's going to be proper social interactions. It's going to be proper nutrition. And we'll talk more about nutrition in a moment. It's going to be limiting excessive, prolonged stressors or stress. And indeed we've done episodes about, just about all of those things but certainly about stress we have an episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast that you can find at hubermanlab.com all about mastering stress, how to avoid long periods of intense stress, what to do to offset those. Given that stress can disrupt the microbiome, whether or not you're fasting or not, those tools ought to be useful. Now, in what I consider to be a landmark study exploring the relationship between the gut microbiome, food intake, and overall health is this paper from Justin Sonnenburg's lab and Chris Gardner's lab, both of which are at Stanford. And the paper entitled \\\"Gut Microbiome-Targeted Diets Modulate Human Immune Status\\\" was published in the journal \\\"Cell\\\", which is among the three top journals perhaps in the world, \\\"Nature\\\", \\\"Science\\\", and \\\"Cell\\\" really being the apex journals for overall science, and especially for biomedical sciences. Now, this is a very interesting study. It was done on humans. There were two major groups. One group of humans was instructed to increase the amount of fiber in their diet and in fact ate a high fiber diet. The other group was instructed to eat a high fermented food diet. Now, both groups started off not having eaten a lot of fiber or a lot of fermented foods and were told to increase the amount of either fiber or fermented foods that they were ingesting over a four-week ramp up period and that was to avoid any major gastric distress. It turns out that if you're not already accustomed to eating a lot of fiber, increasing your amount of fiber dramatically can cause some gastric distress but if you ease into it over time, as we'll see, there's a mechanism behind this, which was unveiled in this study, but if you ease into it over time, then the system can tolerate it. Likewise high fermented foods can be readily tolerated if there's a ramp up phase of ingesting maybe one serving a day, then maybe two servings, and ramping up in this case as high as six servings per day. However, after this ramp up period, the group assigned to the high fiber condition maintained high fiber intake for six weeks and the high fermented food group maintained high fermented food intake for six weeks after which they went off either the high fiber or the high fermented food diet and there was a four-week follow up period during which they gradually returned to baseline. Throughout the study their gut microbiome was evaluated for the diversity of gut microbiota. And there were also a number of measures of immune system function, in particular measures of the so-called inflammatome. The immune system has a lot of different molecules involved. I did a whole episode about the immune system if you're interested in learning what some of those molecules are, various cytokines and signaling molecules that reflect either high inflammation states or reduced inflammation states in the brain and body. You're welcome to check that episode. It's also at hubermanlab.com. Regardless, in this study, they explored the sorts of immune markers that were expressed in either of the two groups and compared those. The basic takeaway of this paper was that contrary to what they predicted, the high fiber diet did not lead to increased microbiota diversity, at least not in all cases. And that was somewhat surprising. You know, the idea is that prebiotic fiber and a lot of the material in fruits and vegetables and grains and so forth are supposed to support microbiotal diversity and the proliferation of existing microbiota. And that is not what they observed, although I want to be very clear in pointing out that the results do not indicate that fiber is not useful for health overall, but it does point to the fact that increasing fiber intake did not increase microbiota diversity, which in general, as I mentioned before, is associated with improvements in microbiota function, health, and overall wellbeing. Now, the high fermented food diet condition was very interesting. It resulted in increased microbiome diversity and decrease inflammatory signals and activity. So there was a twofer. Basically by ingesting high fermented foods in fair abundance, right? You know, four to six servings or more per day is a lot of fermented food intake. We'll talk about what some of those foods were. But the outcome was very positive. There was a clear increase in microbiome diversity and decreased inflammatory signals. So things like interleukin-6, a number of other interleukins and cytokines that are associated with increased inflammation in the brain and body were reduced significantly. Now, let's talk a little bit about this notion of number of servings, et cetera. One somewhat minor point of the study, but I think is useful in terms of taking an actionable stance with this is that the number of servings of fermented foods was not as strong a predictor of improvements in the inflammatome, meaning reduced inflammation and improvements in microbiota diversity, as was the duration of time that the individuals were ingesting fermented foods. In other words, the longer that one is consistently ingesting fermented foods on a daily basis, the better the outcomes in terms of the gut microbiome and for reducing inflammation. So I think that's an important point. And I make that point, especially because for a lot of people, even if you do this ramp up phase, six servings per day of fermented foods can seem like quite a lot. So what are these fermented foods? I think many of us are familiar with certain cheeses and being fermented and beer being fermented and kombucha is fermented. In this study, they focus specifically on low-sugar fermented foods. So this would be plain yogurt, in some cases, kimchi or sauerkraut. An important consideration, however, is that it needs to contain what are called live active cultures, which means there actually have to be microbiota that are alive inside the sauerkraut. One way you know whether or not that's happening is if you purchase sauerkraut or pickles or kimchi from a jar or a container that's on the non-refrigerated shelf or the non-refrigerated section of your grocery store, it is not going to contain live active cultures of microbiota. And likewise, if you consume yogurt that has a lot of sugar or other components added to it, it's not going to have the same positive effect on the microbiome, at least that's the prediction given some of the relationship between the sorts of microbiota that live in sugar versus plain type yogurts. They gave people the option of consuming any number of different low-sugar fermented food. So that again that could be sauerkraut, kimchi, things like kefir, natto. In Japan, they consume natto which is a fermented food. Beer was not one of the fermented foods that was included in the fermented food list. And when we say six servings per day, that is indeed six, six ounce servings, or six, four to six ounce servings. It was not six servings of what's listed on the package. So again, that turns out to be a fair amount of fermented foods. How should you gauge whether or not you're getting enough of this? Well, if you decide to take on this protocol of ingesting more fermented foods, which at least by my read of this study and some of the follow up work that's being done, sounds like a terrific idea if you want to improve your gut microbiome for all the great reasons that one would want to, brain-body health, reduced inflammation, and on and on, well then you definitely want to focus on fermented foods that you enjoy consuming. So for you if that's kefir, or for you that's plain yogurt, or for you that's sauerkraut, which happens to be my personal favorite, then you want to make sure that it's going to be something that you are going to enjoy ingesting quite a lot of and that you're going to be okay with ingesting probably throughout the day. Now, people follow different meal schedules, of course, but this does require not just eating all the fermented foods just before bedtime or at one meal. I suppose you could do that, but in general, it's going to work best in terms of limiting gastric distress by spreading it out throughout the day. I also want to mention brine. Brine is the liquid that surrounds sauerkraut. It's that very salty fluid. And that contains a lot of active live cultures. And they did include or they allowed people to include brine in this study. And in discussions with Dr. Sonnenburg, which we'll go into in more detail on the episode that comes out next week, we talk a lot about the particular value that brine might hold in terms of bringing about microbiota diversity because of the richness of live cultures that it contains. I do want to focus for a moment on the high fiber condition because there were some interesting observations about the people that were placed into that condition. First of all, increasing the amount of fiber definitely increased the number of enzymes that can be used to digest fiber. This is in keeping with this idea of this ramp up phase where accumulation of more fiber intake can over time lead to less gastric distress but also to more utilization of fiber which overall should be a good thing. So while they didn't observe an increase in immune system function or an increase in microbiota diversity, there was an increase in these fiber digesting enzymes. They also observed what they called personalized immune responses. There were some subgroups within the high fiber group that had interesting changes in terms of their reactions to, or I should say their inflammatome, meaning the inflammatory markers they expressed, as well as their microbiota diversity. So there were essentially three groups. One group actually showed an increase in inflammatory markers. So that was quite surprising and probably not wonderful for the message that fiber is always good for us but that was a small cohort within the fiber intake group. Another group and still another group, both showed reductions in baseline microbiota diversity although to varying degrees. So I don't want to paint the picture that fiber is bad but fiber certainly did not have the positive effects on microbiota diversity that the high fermented food diet did. So my read of this study, and I think the stance that many others have taken as a consequence of these data, is that we should be increasing our fermented food intake, that that's simply a good thing to do in order to support our gut microbiome and to reduce inflammatory signals in our brain and body. And there are a number of different ways to do that. I mentioned some of the particular foods. However, anytime you're talking about ingesting fermented foods, especially the high quality ones that come from the refrigerated section of the grocery store, and that have low sugar content, et cetera, we do have to be considerate of cost because certain things like kombuchas, for instance, can be quite costly. I should also mention some kombuchas actually contain alcohol, some do not, or contain very little amounts of alcohol. One way to avoid the high cost of fermented foods while still being able to accumulate a lot of fermented food intake is to simply make those fermented foods yourself. And this is something that we've started exploring and experimenting with in our home. One simple way to do this is to just make your own sauerkraut. It involves very few ingredients. It basically involves cabbage, water, and salt, but there's a specific process that you need to follow in order to create these large volumes of sauerkraut at home using that low cost method. The best resource that I know of in order to follow a great recipe to make homemade sauerkraut would be the recipe for homemade sauerkraut that's contained in Tim Ferriss's book, \\\"The 4-Hour Chef\\\". There's an excellent protocol there. It involves chopping up the cabbage, putting into a bowl, mashing it up with your hands, which can be fun, putting water in there, some salt, covering it, and then keeping it in a particular environment, and then routinely scraping off some of the material from the surface. You have to do that in order to make sure that you're not getting microbes and things growing in it that are bad for you. So you definitely want to pay careful attention to the protocol, but that's a very, very low cost way of generating lots and lots of fermented foods so you don't go broke trying to improve your microbiome. The other thing that you can do if you're really obsessed with kombucha or something like that, to avoid the high cost of kombucha is there are ways that you can get the scoby, which basically allows you to make your own kombucha at home. I've never tried this, but when I was a post doc, there was an undergraduate in the lab, I think, well, I won't out him, but he's now gone on to medical school and I think he's passed his residency and is a practicing doctor, but nonetheless, he was always making kombucha at home. He told me it was exceedingly easy, but then again, he had a number of other skills and attributes that made me think that he could do pretty much anything with ease, whereas I tend to struggle with even basic cooking. So maybe if you're feeling a little more adventurous, you could explore making your own kombucha. But there are a number of different protocols and recipes out there for making your own low-sugar fermented foods. So you needn't run out and buy fresh sauerkraut all the time. I should also mention for those of you that are interested in getting your fermented intake from pickles, jarred pickles rarely if ever contain ferment. Mostly they're just soaked in vinegar, water, and with some spices, but there are some that contain ferment. You actually have to look for that on the container. And I don't know, maybe someone out there knows how to make natto and knows how to make kimchi well and things of that sort. It certainly is the case based on the data from the study that ingesting more servings of fermented food per day ought to be beneficial for our gut microbiome. And since this is an episode not just about gut microbiome but gut-brain health, I should mention that one form of signaling between the gut microbiome and the brain which we did not discuss and I'll just touch on briefly is that when the inflammatome or the genes and markers of inflammation are kept in a healthy range, there's an active signaling of that immune system status to the brain. There's an intermediate cell type that communicates immune status to the brain. And that cell type is the microglial cell. It's a type of glia as the name suggests. When there's a lot of inflammation in the body, these microglia actually get activated and can start eating away at various components of the brain and nervous system. And I don't mean massive eating away. They're not going to digest the whole brain but these microglia are sort of the resident macrophages of the brain. Macrophages are in the periphery and they gobble up debris and things of that sort. The microglia on a regular basis are eating up debris that accumulates across waking cycles and in response to micro-damage to the brain that occurs on a daily basis. So they have a lot of important basic everyday what we call housekeeping functions. But when there's a lot of inflammation in the body, when there's a massive immune response, the microglia can be hyperactivated and that's thought to lead to any number of different cognitive defects or challenges thinking, or maybe even some forms of neurodegeneration over time, although that last point is more of a hypothesis than a well tamped down fact at this point. There's still a lot of investigation to be done in humans. The animal data, however, are very, very strong that when the immune system is activated or chronically activated or hyperactivated that neural tissue, meaning brain tissue and other central nervous system tissue can suffer. So there are a lot of reasons to want to not just improve microbiome diversity, but to also improve immune system function and to limit the number of inflammatory markers that are present in the body because of the way those inflammatory markers can signal deleterious events in the brain. And while eating fermented foods and making your own fermented foods and buying high quality fermented foods might seem like an inconvenience, I would say that from the perspective of cost-benefit or effort-benefit, it's actually quite a good situation where if you can just ramp up the number of fermented foods or servings of fermented foods that you're eating per day over a period of a few weeks so that you're tolerating that well, that ought to have a very positive effect on your microbiome diversity and indeed on gut-brain function. And I'll be the last to suggest that people completely forego on fiber. I think there's some debate out there as to how much fiber we need and whether or not certain forms of fiber are better than others. I'm not going to get into that debate. It's barbed wire enough without me injecting my own views into that debate. But I think there's ample evidence to support the fact that for most people ingesting a fair amount of fiber is going to be a good idea. I would just say that make sure that you're also ingesting a fair amount of fermented foods. And along the lines of fiber, in an accompanying article published in \\\"Cell\\\", which was sort of a what we call a news and views piece about the Sonnenburg and Gardner paper, they make a quite good point, which is that the increase in fiber intake that led to the increase in carbohydrate active enzymes, these CAZymes as they're called, these are enzymes that help digest fiber, quote, \\\"indicating an enhanced capacity for the microbiome to degrade complex carbohydrates present in fibrous foods\\\". So in other words, eating more fiber and fibrous foods allowed for an increase in these enzymes that allow you to eat still more fibrous foods or to better digest fibrous foods that are coming in through other sources. So there is at least one utility for increasing fiber even though it's separate from the gut microbiotal diversity and reducing inflammation. And I'd be remiss if I didn't touch on some of the data and controversy about artificial sweeteners and the gut microbiome. I want to be very clear that what I'm about to tell you has only been established in animal models, in a mouse model, at least to my knowledge. What the studies have shown, and there were several, but one published in the journal \\\"Nature\\\" a few years back is the one that got the most amount of attention is that animals that consume large amounts of artificial sweeteners. in particular things like saccharin or sucralose show disruptions in their gut microbiome. I'm not aware of any studies in humans that show the equivalent effect. And I'm not aware of any studies in humans that show the equivalent effect for things like plant-based, low-calorie sweeteners, things like Stevia, monk fruit, and things of that sort. And at least by my exploration, I couldn't find any data specifically related to the sweetener aspartame. So right now it's somewhat controversial and actually this is kind of a third rail topic out there. When one group will come out saying that artificial sweeteners are bad because they disrupt the gut microbiome, the response generally from a number of people as well, that's only been shown in animal models. And indeed that's true. So right now I don't think that there's a strong case one way or the other. I think that people should basically ask themselves whether or not they like artificial sweeteners or not, whether or not they're willing to risk it or not, and obviously that's an individual choice. I also want to point out a recent study from Diego Bohorquez's lab, which actually shows, however, that neurons in the gut, those neuropod cells, are actually capable of distinguishing between real sugars and artificial sweeteners. This is a really interesting body of work. It was published just now, just recently, I should say, February 2022. The title of the paper is \\\"The Preference for Sugar over Sweetener Depends on a Gut Sensor Cell\\\". And to make a long story short, what they showed was there's a category of neuropod cells that recognize sugar in the gut and signal that information about the presence of sugar in the gut to the brain via the pathways we talked about before, the nodose ganglia, the vagus, dopamine, et cetera, et cetera. Interestingly, the very same category of neurons can respond to artificial sweeteners and signal that information to the brain, but the pattern of signaling and indeed the signature pattern that is conveyed to the brain and received by the brain is actually quite a bit different when these same neurons are responding to artificial sweeteners versus actual sugar. And this is very interesting because what it means is first of all that neurons have incredible specificity in terms of what they are signaling from the gut to the brain. And it also means that there may be a particular signal that the brain receives that says I'm receiving some intake of food or drink that tastes sweet but doesn't actually offer much nutrients in the direction of sweetness, meaning that it doesn't have calories despite being sweet. Now, again, this is all subconscious processing. And like with the previous studies we were just discussing about artificial sweeteners generally and the gut microbiome generally, it's unclear how this relates to humans at this point in time. But given the similarity of cellular processes and molecular processes at the level of gut-brain in mice, I think it stands to reason that these neuropod cells very likely are capable of signaling sweet presence of real sweetener versus artificial sweetener in humans as well, although that still remains to be determined empirically. So I'd like to just briefly recap what I've covered today. I started off by talking about the structure and function of the gut-brain axis. I described the basic structure and function of the digestive pathway, and how that digestive pathway harbors microbiotal species, meaning many, many little bacteria that can signal all sorts of things to the rest of the brain and body. And indeed, we talked about the various ways they do that. We talked about direct pathways, literally nerve networks that extend from the gut up to the brain and from the brain back to the gut. And we talked about indirect pathways, how some of the gut microbiota can actually synthesize neurotransmitters that get out into the bloodstream, can impact the body, can impact the immune system, and can get into the brain and act as neurotransmitters in the brain just as would neurotransmitters that originate from within the brain. We also talked about what constitutes a healthy versus unhealthy microbiome. And it's very clear that having a diverse microbiome is healthier than having a non-diverse microbiome. But as I pointed out, there's still a lot of questions as to exactly what microbiota species you want to enhance and which ones you want to suppress in the gut in order to achieve the best gut-brain axis function. We talked about how things like fasting might impact the microbiome and how some of that might be a little bit counterintuitive based on some of the other positive effects of fasting, or if we're not just discussing fasting, some other types of somewhat restrictive diets either restrictive in time or restrictive in terms of macronutrient intake, how those may or may not improve the health of gut microbiome. And the basic takeaway was that because we don't know exactly how specific diets impact the gut microbiome, and we don't know how fasting either promotes or degrades the microbiome, we really can't say whether or not they are improving or degrading the microbiome at this time. However, it is clear that stress, in particular chronic stress, can disrupt the gut microbiome. It's also clear, of course, that antibiotics can disrupt the gut microbiome. And that brings us to the topic of prebiotics and probiotics. And I emphasized the fact that for most people, ingesting high quality non-processed foods that includes some prebiotic fiber but also that includes some probiotics will probably be healthy but not excessive levels of probiotics. High levels of supplemented probiotics of the sort that would come in a probiotic pill or even prescription probiotics would probably lend themselves best to when people were under severe chronic stress or had just come off a serious round or an ongoing or repeated rounds of antibiotics. That does not mean that ingesting probiotics in any form or any kind is not good. It just means that the very high dose probiotics, again, typically found in prescription form or capsule pill form probably are best reserved to cases where of course your doctor prescribes them. You should always follow your doctor's advice. But in cases where perhaps you are jetlagged, you're traveling excessively for any reason, or working excessively, you're not getting enough sleep, or your diet is radically changed from normal. And we talked about how increasing the amount of fiber in your diet might be useful for increasing fiber digesting enzymes and the assimilation of fibrous foods but that it's really the ingestion of fermented foods and, in fact, getting anywhere from four or even up to six servings a day of fermented foods can be immensely beneficial for reducing inflammatory markers in the body and for improving microbiota diversity all along the gut and thereby improving signaling and outcomes along the gut-brain axis. So we went all the way from structure to function to the four kinds of signaling, mechanical, chemical, indirect, direct, probiotics, fiber, and fermented foods. And I tossed in a little bit at the end there also about ways that you can make your own fermented foods at home in order to try and offset some of the costs. Also, it's just kind of fun to do. And some of those actually taste quite good. I've actually found that the fermented sauerkraut that we're making at home actually rivals the sauerkraut that you can buy out of the refrigerated section at the grocery store. And I am by no means a skilled cook or chef and basically have no culinary skill whatsoever. So if I can do it, you can do it. I hope you found this information useful and perhaps also actionable. One of my motivations for doing this episode was, again, as a primer for the episode with Dr. Justin Sonnenburg where we go really deep into the gut microbiome, less so into the gut-brain axis, but really deep into the gut microbiome, what it is, what it does, what it doesn't do, and some of the emerging findings from his lab that are yet to be published. And I also was excited to do this episode because I think many of us have heard about the gut microbiome. We hear about these bacteria that live in our gut. We hear about the gut-brain axis or that 90% or more of the serotonin that we make is made in our gut. We hear about the gut as a second brain and so forth. But I think for many people, they don't really have a clear picture of what the gut microbiome is and the pathways and mechanisms by which it can signal to the brain and to the other parts of the body. So I hope that today's information at least improved the clarity around that topic and leaves you with a more vivid picture of this incredible system that is our gut-brain axis.

While supplements aren't necessary for everybody, many people derive tremendous benefit from them. One of the key issues with supplements, however, is that the quality of supplements can vary tremendously and oftentimes that relates to the precision, or I should say the lack of precision, with which companies put different amounts of supplements in the capsules and tablets that are listed on the bottle. For that reason, we partner with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E, because Thorne supplements have the highest degree of stringency in terms of the quality of ingredients and the specificity of the amounts of the ingredients. That is, what is listed on the bottle is actually what is contained in the capsules and tablets and powders. If you'd like to see the Thorne supplements that I take, you can go to Thorne, that's thorne.com/u/huberman and there you can see the Thorne supplements that I take. You can get 20% off any of those supplements. And if you navigate deeper into the Thorne site, you can get 20% off any of the other supplements that Thorne makes. That's thorne.com/u/huberman.

(energetic music) I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today's podcast episode is all about sleep, and we're also going to talk about the mirror image of sleep, which is wakefulness. Now, these two phases of our life, sleep and wakefulness, govern everything about our mental and physical health, and we're not just gonna talk about what's useful about sleep, we're also gonna talk about how to get better at sleeping, and that will include how to get better at falling asleep, timing your sleep, and accessing better sleep quality. In doing so, we're also gonna discuss how to get more focused and alert in wakefulness, so because sleep and wakefulness are related, we really can't have a conversation about one without the other. Now, in keeping with this theme, you may catch a few snores in the background. Unlike me, my bulldog, Costello, can fall asleep anywhere, anytime, and he happens to be sleeping over there in the corner, so if you hear snoring, that's what that's about. As always, I wanna just mention that this podcast is part of my effort to bring zero-cost-to-consumer public education about science and science-related tools, it is unrelated to my teaching and research roles at Stanford School of Medicine. Today's podcast is brought to us by Helix mattresses, having the proper sleep environment, both the environment you're sleeping in and the object you're sleeping on, is critically important to getting a good night's sleep. Helix mattresses are a little different than most because they're matched to your specific sleep needs, as well as whether or not you tend to run hot or cold as you sleep through the night, what position you sleep in, and so forth, so if you go to their website, they have a quiz that you can take that matches you to the particular mattress that's gonna be best for your sleep needs. I've always had a lot of trouble sleeping, I'm one of these people that can fall asleep easily, but then I wake up and I have a hard time getting back to sleep, and once I switched to a Helix mattress that was precisely matched to my sleep needs, I found I could sleep through the night, which has made a tremendous difference for me. If you wanna try Helix mattresses, you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman, and that will give you up to $200 off on a mattress order, as well as two pillows free with your mattress order, and of course, having the proper pillows is just as important as having the proper mattress. Today's podcast is also brought to us by Headspace, Headspace is a meditation app that teaches you how to meditate. It's fair to say that now there's a ton of research out there in peer-reviewed journals supporting the fact that mindfulness meditation can support mental and physical health, but many people find it hard to meditate, in fact, I'm one of these people. I started meditating in my teens, but then I would drop it every few weeks or so and then I'd get back to it maybe the following week or every year, I just was not very regular about my meditation practice, and then a few years ago I was flying a lot for work and I was on JetBlue flights, and they have Headspace as part of the choice of things that you can watch on the TV screen, and as I started meditating more regularly, what I found is my sleep was better, I would arrive feeling more rested, it was just a tremendous effects on my work performance and other aspects of my life. If you wanna try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer, if you do that, you'll get one month of all of Headspace's meditations for free, that's the best offer right now, so if interested, go to headspace.com/specialoffer. So let's talk about sleep, sleep is this incredible period of our lives where we are not conscious. We might dream, we might twitch, we might even wake up, but in sleep, we are only in relation to things that are happening within our brain and body. Outside sensory experience, in most cases, can't really impact us, and yet, sleep is this tremendously important period of life because it resets our ability to be focused, alert, and emotionally stable in the wakeful period, so we can't really talk about wakefulness, focus, motivation, mood, wellbeing without thinking about sleep, and that's why we're devoting this entire month to the discussion about sleep. Now, we also can't talk about sleep and think about sleep without thinking about wakefulness because it turns out that the period that we call sleep and the period we call wakefulness are tethered to one another. What we do in the waking state determines when we fall asleep, how quickly we fall asleep, whether or not we stay asleep, and how we feel when we wake up the next day, and today, we're going to talk mostly about how to get better at sleeping, and the reason for starting the conversation that way as opposed to just diving into a lot of biology about sleep, is because first of all, there's a lot of information out there already about the biology of sleep. We're gonna touch on a little bit of this, things like stages of sleep and sleep spindles, melatonin, and dreaming, but I think that by now, most people are aware that getting a really good night's sleep on a consistent basis is critically important, but most people don't know how to do that. In fact, I'm guessing that very few of you out there are consistently getting seven to nine hours of really terrific sleep, waking up feeling rested and like you're ready to attack the day, and being able to go through the day feeling focused and alert without dips in energy or focus, so if you're like most people, which includes me, you have some challenges with sleep at least every third or fifth night or so and maybe even more often, so we're really gonna go tool-heavy today and talk about tools that can help you fall asleep, sleep better, and emerge from sleep feeling more rested, and we're gonna do that by grounding our discussion of tools in peer-reviewed studies, mostly from the last 10 years, although some even more recent than that, and we're gonna start by discussing what is sleep and what governs the timing of the onset of sleep, in other words, what makes you get sleepy at a particular time of day. So what determines how well we sleep and the quality of our wakeful state? Turns out that's governed by two forces, the first force is a chemical force, it's called adenosine. Adenosine is a molecule in our nervous system and body that builds up the longer we are awake, so if you've just slept for 8, or 9, or 10 really deep, restful hours, adenosine is gonna be very low in your brain and body. If, however, you've been awake for 10, 15, or more hours, adenosine levels are going to be much higher. Adenosine creates a sort of sleep drive or a sleep hunger, and actually, hunger is the appropriate word here because for most of what we're gonna discuss today, we can think of it in an analogous way to nutrition. Your nutrition and how well you feel after you eat certain foods, your overall level of fitness and your cellular health and your heart health isn't governed by any one food item that you might eat or not eat, it's governed by a number of different factors, how often you eat, how much you eat, which items you eat, et cetera, and what works best for you. In the same way, your sleep and your wakefulness are the product of kind of the average of a number of different behaviors, how long you've been awake is a key one because of this molecule, adenosine. So the reason you get sleepy when you've been up for a while is because adenosine is creeping up steadily the longer you've been awake, and a good way to remember this and think about adenosine is to think about caffeine. Caffeine, for most people, except a very small percentage of people, wakes them up, it makes them feel more alert, in fact, some people are so sensitive to caffeine that they feel jittery if they drink it even in small amounts, other people can drink large amounts of caffeine and not feel jittery at all. Caffeine acts as an adenosine antagonist, what that means is that when you ingest caffeine, whether or not it's coffee or soda or tea, or in any other form, it binds to the adenosine receptor, it sort of parks there just like a car would park in a given parking slot, and therefore, adenosine can't park in that slot. Now, when caffeine parks in the adenosine receptor slot, nothing really happens downstream of that receptor, the receptor can't engage the normal cellular functions of making that cell and you feel sleepy. So the reason caffeine wakes you up is because it blocks the sleepiness receptor, it blocks the sleepy signal, and this is why when that caffeine wears off, adenosine will bind to that receptor, sometimes with even greater, what we call affinity, and you feel the crash, you feel especially tired. Now, I'm not here to demonize caffeine, I love caffeine, and I drink it in the morning and I drink it in the afternoon, but I'm one of these people that, either because of my tolerance or because of some genetic variations that exist among people in terms of their adenosine receptors, I can drink caffeine as late as 4:00 or 5:00 p.m. in the evening and still fall asleep just fine. Some people can't have any caffeine at all or can't have any caffeine past 11:00 a.m. or else their sleep is totally disrupted. All of this has to do with the relationship between adenosine and these adenosine receptors, genetic variation, things that are very hard to find out except experimentally, meaning each of you needs to decide and figure out for yourselves whether or not you can tolerate caffeine and at what times of day you can tolerate caffeine in order to still fall asleep easily and get good sleep, so rather than demonize caffeine, or say that everyone can drink caffeine until late, you need to figure out what's right for you. Caffeine has a lot of health benefits, it also, for some people, can be problematic for health, it can raise blood pressure, et cetera, caffeine increases this molecule that's a neuromodulator that we call dopamine, we discussed this in episode one, which tends to make us feel good, motivated, and give us energy because, as you may have learned in episode one, dopamine is related to another neuromodulator called epinephrine, which gives us energy, in fact, epinephrine is made from dopamine. So let's just take a step back and think about what we're talking about when we're talking about sleepiness, sleepiness is driven by increases in adenosine that happen naturally, caffeine prevents the adenosine from having its action of making us sleepy by blocking that receptor, so it gives us energy and it increases our dopamine levels, but some people can't tolerate caffeine very well, other people can tolerate it just fine, so you need to determine that experimentally. All the data say there's tremendous variation, and right now, the only way that I'm aware of for you to decide whether or not caffeine is a good or a bad thing for you, and whether or not you should ingest it at a given time of day or at all is really to figure that out on your own, in fact, there's a small subset of people that can drink caffeine until very late and they have no trouble falling asleep because they actually have a mutant form of the adenosine receptor, so in keeping with the theme of science and science-related tools, this is one of those cases where I can't give you a one-size-fits-all prescription except to say you need to experiment with caffeine in a way that's safe for you and explore that and figure out what works for you, and then stick with that. Okay, so adenosine is driving this sleep hunger, when adenosine is low, it's like we're well-fed, we're not very hungry, and when adenosine is high, it's like we're fasted for a long time and we tend to be very hungry, so that when adenosine is high, we really wanna fall asleep. If you want, I'm not suggesting you do this experiment, but you can do it, you can stay up for four more hours than you're used to staying up and you'll find that you're very, very sleepy. That's because adenosine is building up at levels higher and higher because you've been awake for those extra four hours. However, if you've ever pulled an all-nighter, you'll notice something interesting, as morning rolls around, you'll suddenly feel an increase in your energy and alertness again, even though adenosine has been building up for the entire night. Now, why is that? The reason that is is because there's a second force which is governing when you sleep and when you're awake, and that force is a so-called circadian force, circadian means about a day or about 24 hours, and inside all of us is a clock that exists in your brain and my brain, and the brain of every animal that we're aware of, that determines when we want to be sleepy and when we want to be awake. Just think about it, we don't go through the day wanting to fall asleep every 30 minutes and then feeling like we're wide awake, our sleep and our period of sleepiness tends to be condensed into one block, typically one 6- to 10-hour block, although there's also variation in terms of how much people want to sleep, and we're going to discuss how you can diagnose your absolute sleep need as well as how to recover sleep that you've lost. That block of sleep and when it falls within each 24-hour cycle is governed by a number of different things, but the most powerful thing that's governing when you want to be asleep and when you want to be awake is light, and in particular, it's governed by sunlight, and I can't emphasize enough how important and how actionable this relationship is between light and when you want to sleep. It's quite simple on the face of it and it's quite simple to resolve, but people tend to make a big mess of this whole circadian literature, frankly, so let's just break it down from the standpoint of what's going on in your brain and body as you go through one 24-hour day. Let's start with waking, so regardless of how well you slept at night or whether or not you were up all night, most people tend to wake up sometime around when the sun rises, maybe not right at sunrise, but within an hour or two or maybe three of sunrise. Now, I realize there are night-shift workers and there are people traveling and experiencing jet lag where this is not going to be the case, we are gonna deal with jet lag and shift work at the end of this podcast, but for most people, we tend to wake up about the time that the sun is rising or so, and as we do that, adenosine levels tend to be low if we've been asleep for reasons that you now understand, and our system generates an internal signal that is in the form of a hormone. Now, I've talked a lot about neuromodulators and neurotransmitters, I haven't talked a lot about hormones yet on this podcast. The definition of a hormone is it's a substance, a chemical that's released from one organ in your body that goes and acts on other organs elsewhere in your body, including your nervous system. When you wake up in the morning, you wake up because a particular hormone called cortisol is released from your adrenal glands, your adrenal glands sit right above your kidneys, and there's a little pulse of cortisol. There's also a pulse of some, and when I say a pulse, I just mean the release of a little bit, there's also a pulse of epinephrine, which is adrenaline, from your adrenals and also in your brain, and you feel awake. Now, that pulse of cortisol and adrenaline and epinephrine might come from your alarm clock, it might come from you naturally waking up, but it tends to alert your whole system in your body that it's time to increase your heart rate, it's time to start tensing your muscles, it's time to start moving about. It's very important that that cortisol pulse come early in the day, or at least, early in your period of wakefulness, I say that because some people are waking up at 8:00 p.m. and are sleeping all day, but it's very important that that pulse of cortisol occur early in the day and that it happens all at once, it sort of sets a rising tide of cortisol in your system. Now, many of you have probably heard about cortisol in relation to stress, and indeed, as we go through our day and our life, different stressors, different events happen in our life that make us feel more alert. Some of the more stressful ones might be looking at your credit card bill and seeing what seems to be a fraudulent charge, or looking at your phone and suddenly seeing a text that something you thought was gonna happen at a particular time is not gonna happen, or you're running late, those will tend to increase norepinephrine and epinephrine and adrenaline in your system, and if they're severe enough, you'll start getting some pulses of cortisol released from your adrenals throughout the day, but there's this normal, healthy rising tide of cortisol that happens early in the day, and I say healthy because it wakes you up, it makes you feel alert, and it makes you feel able to move and wanting to move and to go about your day for work, for exercise, for school, for social relations, et cetera. So when you wake up in the morning is when that cortisol pulse takes off, and something else important happens, a timer is set in your body and in your nervous system that dictates when a different hormone called melatonin, which makes you sleepy, will be secreted from a particular brain region, so let's talk about that. When you wake up in the morning and you experience that rise in cortisol, there's a timer that starts going, and these are cellular timers and they're dictated by the relation between different organs in your body, that says to your brain and body that in about 12 to 14 hours, a different hormone, this hormone we're calling melatonin, will be released from your pineal gland. So there's two mechanisms here, a wakefulness signal and a sleepiness signal, and the wakefulness signal triggers the onset of the timer for the sleepiness signal. Now, that sleepiness signal that we call melatonin that's released from the pineal comes only from the pineal. Unless you're taking exogenous melatonin, you're supplementing with melatonin, the only source of melatonin in your body is going to be this pineal gland, so let's talk about the pineal gland for a second. The pineal gland is a gland that sits kind of in the little structure near, for the aficionados out there, it's kind of near the fourth ventricle, it's about the size of a pea, Descartes, the philosopher, said that the pineal was the seat of the soul, he said that because it's one of the few structures in the human brain that there's only one of them, you know, most structures, there's one on either side of the brain, so-called bihemispheric, but the pineal, there's only one. I don't know anything about souls, really, certainly not the science of souls, but I think it's very unlikely that the pineal is the seat of the soul, but it is a very interesting organ because it's the only organ in our body that releases melatonin, and that melatonin makes us sleepy and lets us fall asleep. Now, I'm guessing that many of you are probably asking, \\\"Should I take melatonin?\\\" My personal bias on this is, except in rare cases, no, for the following reason, melatonin has a second function, which is that melatonin also suppresses the onset of puberty. In kids, and especially in babies, melatonin isn't just released in the evening 12 to 16 hours after we wake, melatonin is released chronically, or tonically, throughout the day and night, and that chronic or tonic release of melatonin is known to suppress some of the other hormones in other regions of the brain that trigger the onset of puberty. Now, if you or your child has been taking melatonin, don't freak out, as always, any kind of supplement or anything that you're going to take or think about taking, you really need to consult with your doctor, I've said this many times on this podcast and it's in the show notes, et cetera, but before you remove anything or add anything to what you're already doing, please do consult with a healthcare professional. However, melatonin is known to suppress the onset of puberty, so much so that regular, cyclic, cycled periods of melatonin release from the pineal really correlate with the onset of puberty and early adulthood, meaning as we start secreting melatonin only at night, that's also when we tend to transition out of puberty. Now, there are a lot of things that correlate in our nervous system, so that doesn't necessarily mean it controls it, but in this case we know, based on lots of data, endocrinology and so forth, that melatonin suppresses the onset of puberty, so supplementing melatonin could be problematic for that reason, but if you've already gone through puberty, it could also have some impact on other hormone systems in your body, so that's why I personally don't like to use melatonin to fall asleep. There's another reason, which is that melatonin will help you fall asleep but it won't help you stay asleep, and many people who take melatonin find that they wake up three to five hours later unable to fall back asleep. Part of the reason for that might be that melatonin purchased at, you can buy it over the counter in most areas of the world even though it's a hormone, which is a little unusual, you can't just go into a pharmacy, at least in the US, and buy testosterone or cortisol or estrogen, you need a prescription, but you can go buy melatonin for whatever reason, I don't know the reasons for that legality, but it's been shown many times, and now I'm borrowing from some items that were in Matt Walker's book, \\\"Why We Sleep,\\\" where he stated there is evidence that, in commercially available melatonin, the amount of melatonin has been tested for various brands, it can range anywhere from being 15% of what's listed on the bottle, okay, so if they list this as 100 milligrams, it would be a tremendously high dose, it turns out it's only 15 milligrams in that particular pill or capsule, or up to 400 times more than what's listed on the bottle, so it's completely unregulated, and so for those of you taking melatonin, I will discuss at the end of the podcast some other potential alternatives that are probably safer and don't have these issues. So should you take melatonin? My personal bias is no, but for many people, they find that it does help them, and so if you do find it helps you, then just consider what I'm saying in light of the other practices that you're doing and talk to your healthcare professional. Okay, so the rhythm of cortisol and melatonin is what we call endogenous, it's happening in us all the time without any external input, in fact, if we were in complete darkness, living in a cave with no artificial lights whatsoever, or we were in complete brightness where we never experienced any darkness, these rhythms of cortisol and melatonin would continue, you would have a bump in cortisol, or a pulse in cortisol, that would drop off with time, and then melatonin would come up about 12 to 14 hours later, but these endogenous systems of our body, which are both hormonal and neural, were set so that external things could govern when they happen. Now, this takes us back to episode one of the podcast that if you haven't listened to already, you might wanna listen to, where we talked about sensation and perception and all that, I'm not gonna review it again here, but there's one particular sensory event, one particular influence on your nervous system that determines when that cortisol is going to start to rise, so if you were in complete darkness, it would happen once per 24-hour cycle, but it would be somewhat later and later each day, whereas under normal circumstances, what happens is you wake up, and what happens when you wake up? You open your eyes. When your open your eyes, light comes into your eyes. Now, the way this system works is that you have a particular set of neurons in your eye, they're called retinal ganglion cells, you don't have to remember that if you don't want to, but these retinal ganglion cells are brain neurons, again, the retina is just the one piece of your brain, actually, two pieces because most of you have two retinas, that resides outside the skull, per se. When light comes into the eye, there's a particular group of retinal ganglion cells, or type of retinal ganglion cells, that perceives a particular type of light and communicates that to this clock that resides right above the roof of your mouth called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, okay? So I know this can get a little complicated, but these retinal ganglion cells, when you open your eyes, light comes in, and an electrical signal is sent to this central clock we call the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and the suprachiasmatic nucleus has connections with essentially every cell and organ of your body. Now, it's vitally important that we get light communicated to this central clock in order to time the cortisol and melatonin properly, and when I say properly, I can say that with confidence because we know based on a lot of evidence that if you don't get your cortisol and melatonin rhythms right, there are tremendously broad and bad effects on cardiovascular health, dementia, metabolic effects, learning, depression, dementia, in fact, there're so many negative effects associated with getting this wrong that I don't wanna get into it in too much detail, in fact, I feel like we've been bombarded with all this information about how we're not sleeping well, we're not sleeping at the right times, we're not sleeping enough, to the point where people now have sleep anxiety, if they can't sleep well for a night, they're feeling overwhelmed by that and it's sort of now they're stressed about not being able to sleep which is making it harder to sleep, et cetera. I really wanna focus on what we can do to anchor these systems properly, so let's think about what happens when we do this correctly and how to do it correctly. When we wake up, our eyes open, now, if we're in a dark room, there isn't enough light to trigger the correct timing of this cortisol-melatonin thing, these rhythms. You might say, \\\"Well, why won't any light do it?\\\" Well, it turns out that these neurons in our eye that set the circadian clock and then allow our circadian clock to set all the clocks of all the cells and organs and tissues of our body responds best to a particular quality of light and amount of light, and those are the qualities of light and amount of light that come from sunlight, so these neurons, what they're really looking for, although they don't have a mind of their own, is the sun at what we call low solar angle, the eye and the nervous system don't know anything about sunrises or sunsets, it only knows the quality of light that comes in when the sun is low in the sky, the system evolved so that when the sun is low in the sky, there's a particular contrast between yellows and blues that triggers the activation of these cells, so if you wake up and you look at your phone or your computer, or you flip on a bunch of artificial lights, will these cells be activated? And the answer is, sort of, they'll be activated but not in the optimal way. What you want to do is get sunlight in your eyes as close to waking as possible. Now, I wanna be really clear about this because I've talked about it on other podcasts when I was a guest and I talked about it on my Instagram feed, and there seemed to be the same questions coming up again and again, these neurons don't know sunlight, per se, they don't know sunrise or sunset, for that matter, they don't know artificial light from sunlight, what they respond best to, however, is the quality and amount of light that comes in when the sun is low in the sky, that means that if you can watch the sunrise, great, that's perfect for triggering activation of these cells, however, if you wake up a few hours after the sunrise, which I tend to most days, personally, you still wanna get outside and view sunlight, you don't need the sunlight beaming you directly in the eyes, there's a lot of photons, light energy, that's scattered from sunlight at this time, but the key is to get that light energy, from sunlight, ideally, into your eyes. Now, I know many of you are already asking, \\\"Well, I live in Scandinavia,\\\" or, \\\"I can't get sunlight, \\\"there's buildings around me,\\\" et cetera, we will get to all of that, but it's critically important that you get outside to get this light. I had a discussion with a colleague of mine, Dr. Jamie Zeitzer, who's in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford, a world expert in this, and he tells me that it's 50 times less effective to view this sunlight through a window, through a car windshield, or through the side window of a car than it is to just get outside with no sunglasses and view light early in the day. Now, if you can't see the sunrise, like I said, you can see this within an hour or two of sunrise, but it has to be low solar angle, once the sun is overhead, the quality of light shifts so that you miss this opportunity to time the cortisol pulse, and that turns out to be a bad thing to do, you really wanna time that cortisol pulse properly because, we'll get into this a little bit more later, but a late-shifted cortisol pulse, in particular, a 9:00 p.m. or 8:00 p.m. increase in cortisol is one of the consequences, and maybe one of the causes, of a lot of anxiety disorders and depression, so it's kind of a chicken-egg thing, we don't know whether or not it's correlated with, it's the cause, or the effect, but it's a signature of depression and anxiety disorder. Bringing that cortisol pulse earlier in your wakeful period, earlier in your day, has positive benefits ranging from blood pressure to mental health, et cetera, not gonna list them all off because there's just so many of them, but many, many positive things happen when you are getting the cortisol early in the day far away from your melatonin pulse. Okay, so how long should you be outside? Well, this is gonna vary tremendously because some people live in environments where it's very bright, so let's say it's Colorado in the middle of winter, there's a snowfield, there's no cloud cover, and you walk outside, there's going to be so much photon light energy arriving on your retina that it probably only takes 30 to 60 seconds to trigger the central clock and set your cortisol and melatonin rhythms properly and get everything lined up nicely, whereas if you're in Scandinavia in the depths of winter and you wake up at 5:00 a.m. and the sun is just barely creeping across the horizon and then goes back down again a few hours later, you probably are not getting enough sunlight in order to set these rhythms, so many people find that they need to use sunlight simulators in the form of particular lights that were designed to simulate sunlight, however, and I'm not out to attack the companies that produce those, there's another solution to that, you can simply go outside for longer, even if there's a lot of dense cloud cover, you're probably getting anywhere from 10,000 to 50,000 lux, L-U-X, which is just a measure of light energy, and that should be sufficient to set the circadian clock. You could say, \\\"Well, the lights in my house or my phone \\\"are really, really bright, right? \\\"Everyone's telling us to stay off our phones at night \\\"because they're really bright,\\\" but guess what, it turns out that early in the day, your retina is not very sensitive, which means you need a lot of photons, ideally coming from sunlight, to set these clock mechanisms, so looking at your phone or artificial lights is fine if you wake up before sunrise, but it's not going to work to set these clock mechanisms, and this is supported by dozens, if not hundreds, of quality peer-reviewed studies, so you wanna use sunlight, if you can't see sunlight because of your environment, then you are going to have to opt for artificial light, and in that case, you're going to want an artificial light that either simulates sunlight or has a lot of blue light. Now, without going off course here, you might be saying, \\\"Wait, I've heard blue light is bad for me.\\\" Actually, blue light is great for this mechanism during the day, we can talk about blue light and blue blockers, but you really want a lot of blue and yellow light arriving on the retina early in the day. Let me be clear about something, you never ever want to look at any light, sunlight or artificial light, that is painful to look at. If you find that your eyes are watering or you're having challenges maintaining, you know, looking at this thing for a while because it's painful, that light is too bright and you do not wanna damage your retina, so you don't wanna gaze at the sun refusing to blink and burn your retina, that's actually possible to do, you don't wanna do that. You have a proper blink reflex installed in you since birth, and if you feel like something's too bright and you need to blink, it means you need to blink, that it's too much light, so please don't beam your eyes with really bright light, but blue light, in particular, blue light and yellow light coming from sunlight is ideal, if you're going to get it from artificial light because you can't get enough sunlight, well, then, artificial lights that are rich in blue, blue wavelengths, are going to be ideal for setting this mechanism. A lot of people will say, \\\"Oh, I should be \\\"wearing blue blockers throughout the day.\\\" No, that's the exact wrong thing, if you're going to use blue blockers, we can talk about that, that should be reserved for late in the evening because light suppresses melatonin. I've been asked many times before about this pineal gland and there are a lot of ancient practices that map to some of the things that I'm saying, and people will always say, \\\"Oh, I heard that sunlight \\\"is great for the pineal.\\\" Well, perhaps, but we have to careful about that phrase, sunlight inhibits the pineal, it prevents it from releasing melatonin, darkness allows the pineal to release melatonin, so the pineal is not the gland or the organ of sunlight, it is the gland of darkness, in fact, melatonin can be thought of as a sleepiness signal that's correlated with darkness, so get up each morning, try and get outside, I know that can be challenging for people, but anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes of sunlight exposure is going to work well for most people, and you wanna do this on a regular basis and you don't have to do it exactly at sunrise, I realize I'm repeating myself, but somehow, despite barking at people about this for a couple years now, I keep getting the same questions, and somehow, it hasn't been sinking in, which could be related to some circadian disorder, I'm just kidding, if it's not sinking in, it's probably that I'm not being effective in communicating the information, but get that bright light early in the day from sunlight, and if you can't get it from sunlight, get it from artificial light. What kinds of artificial lights will work? Well, there are these sunrise simulators, but the ring lights that people use for selfies and this sort of thing, for posting on Instagram, those generate a lot of blue light. If wanna get experimental about this, there's a free app, I have no relationship to the app, but it's a great app called Light Meter that you can use your phone and you can measure the amount of photon energy in your environment, and it's kind of a fun experiment to do, you can go outside in the morning and you'll see that there's 10,000, 20,000 lux, even though it might seem like it's kinda dim or there's tree cover or cloud cover, you go inside and you shine an artificial light at your phone, press the button on Light Meter and you'll find that it's only 500 or 1,000 lux, and you realize that even though it seems really bright, the artificial light is very condensed, whereas the outside light is scattered in the atmosphere, and so you can think that you're not getting much sunlight but you're actually getting much more outside, so get outside, get that sunlight early in the day, and try and do it on a consistent basis. If you can't do it every day or you sleep through this period of the early day, low solar angle, don't worry about it, these systems in the body, these hormone systems and neurotransmitter systems that make you awake at certain periods of the day and sleepy at other times are operating by averaging when you view the brightest light. Now, that can immediately tell us that what most people are doing is terrible, they're waking up and they're looking at their phone, which isn't triggering activation of these cells in the eye and the central circadian clock, then a few hours later, they might get in their car with sunglasses and drive. Now, a note about sunglasses and prescription lenses, absolutely never, ever, ever compromise safety for the sorts of things I'm talking about, so if you need to wear sunglasses for safety reasons, wear them, absolutely, if you wear prescription lenses or contacts, wear them, they won't filter out the wavelengths of light that are necessary for setting these central clocks, so safety first, of course, if you have a retinal degenerative disorder, retinitis pigmentosa, macular degeneration, or glaucoma, or those run in your family, you want to avoid excessively bright light all the time, you wanna be very cautious about that, you're going to wanna get your light exposure through seeing dimmer light, including sunlight, but for longer periods of time, perhaps. You might immediately ask, \\\"What about low-vision or blind people, \\\"how do they set these central clocks?\\\" Well, turns out that low-vision and blind people, most of them, provided they still have eyes, that the eyes weren't removed because of a burn or a tumor or something like that, still maintain these neurons that set the circadian clock, which brings me to a really important point, it's not about seeing and perceiving the sun, this is a subconscious mechanism by which these neurons, which are called melanopsin ganglion cells, these neurons set your central clocks by getting activated by the particular wavelengths of light that are present in the atmosphere, even coming through cloud cover, and you don't need to see or perceive the sun in order to get this mechanism to start. Now, it's such a vitally important mechanism because it dictates how well and what time you will want to fall asleep later in the day, so for those of you that are night owls and you insist that you're a night owl and you have the genetic polymorphism that makes you a night owl, you may very well have that genetic polymorphism, those genes that make you want to stay up late and wake up late, but chances are, about half of you that think that you're night owls are just not getting enough sunlight early in the day. So viewing light early in the day, ideally sunlight, is key for establishing healthy sleep-wake rhythms and for allowing you to fall asleep easily at night. Now, it's not gonna make sure that all that happens every single time, but it is the foundation of proper sleep and what we call circadian health, it governs metabolism and so many other things that are supposed to exist on a regular 24-hour cycle. Some of you, many of you, might be asking, \\\"What else can help set this rhythm?\\\" Well, it turns out that light is what we call the primary zeitgeber, the time giver, but other things can help establish this rhythm of cortisol followed by melatonin 12 to 16 hours later as well. The other things besides light are timing of food intake, timing of exercise, as well as various drugs or chemicals that one might ingest, not illegal drugs, although those will impact circadian mechanisms as well, but the reason we focus so heavily on light is that light is the main way that this central clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, was supposed to be set, and we know that because it's the only direct input to the clock. These neurons in the eye that are also part of the brain that we call melanopsin ganglion cells that, not so incidentally, were discovered by my friend and colleague David Berson at Brown University, and others, Samer Hattar, King-Wai Yau, et cetera, worked out the mechanisms, the molecular mechanisms, but it was really David Berson that discovered these incredibly fascinating, you know, these are cells that aren't important for sight like pattern vision, but are for setting our clocks, David's really credited with making that discovery. Those cells are the main way and the only direct way to set the clock, in fact, it's fair to say that light viewed by these melanopsin cells, in particular, sunlight, is 1,000 to 10,000 times more effective than, say, getting up in darkness and just exercising. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't exercise early in the day in darkness if that's what you like to do, it will have somewhat an effect on raising your wakefulness early in the day and setting these rhythms, and this is because of some other pathways, for the aficionados out there who wanna know more neuroscience, here's how it goes, you've got this clock above the roof of your mouth that churns out this 24-hour rhythm and it's communicated to all the other organs and tissues of your body, but there's another structure, it has a cool name, it's called the intergeniculate leaflet, which sits a few millimeters away in the brain, and it's involved in regulating the clock output through what's called non-photic, non-light-type influences like exercise and feeding, et cetera. So if you are not feeling awake during the day and you're having trouble sleeping, get the sunlight exposure that we just talked about, but in addition to that, if you wanna become an early riser, for instance, and you wanna feel more awake during the early part of the day, by getting that light exposure and exercising early in the day, you will, after two or three days, you will naturally start to wake up earlier in the day, and that's because these clock mechanisms have shifted, it's like setting the clock earlier as opposed to delaying the clock, and that takes us to a somewhat complicated, but very important, aspect to all this, which is, what sets the clock and keeps it anchored? The main thing is that bright light early in the day, the other thing is sunset, when the sun is also at low solar angle, low, close to the horizon, by viewing sunlight at that time of day in the evening, or afternoon, depending on what time of year it is and where you are in the world, these melanopsin cells, these neurons in your eye, signal the central circadian clock that it's the end of the day, and there's a really nice study that was published last year, and I will put links to these references on a website not too long from now, there was a really nice study that showed that viewing sunlight around the time of the sunset, doesn't have to be just crossing the horizon, but circa sunset, within an hour or so of sunset, prevents some of the bad effects of light in preventing melatonin release later that same night, so let me repeat this, viewing light early in the day is key, viewing light later in the day when the sun is setting, or around that time, can help protect these mechanisms, your brain and body, against the negative effects of light later in the day, so let me talk about you would do that, you'd go view the sunset or you would go outside in the late afternoon or evening, again, if you safely can do that with sunglasses off, you will, if you need to wear sunglasses, fine, but it will take probably 100 to 1,000 times longer with dark sunglasses than if you take them off, again, if you wanna do this through a window at work, that's fine, but it'll take 50 times longer, so the best thing to do is just to get outside for a few minutes, anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes, also in the afternoon. Having those two signals arriving to your central clock that your body, your internal world, knows when it's morning and knows when it's evening, is tremendously powerful. Maybe think about it this way, every cell in your body needs glucose and energy, it needs, whether or not it gets that from meats or it gets it from ketones or it gets it from carbohydrates or fruit or vegetables, it doesn't matter, it is eventually converted into a certain form of energy that all your cells use, but you don't take glucose, you don't take bread or a steak or a nice orange and shove it in your ear, you put it in your mouth, it goes into your stomach, it's digested, and then that resource is distributed to all the cells of your body. Every cell in your body needs oxygen, and you don't put a hose you know, through your nostril or through your ear or through some other orifice in your body, you inhale air and it's then distributed via the lungs to the cells in your blood stream, and then it's distributed to all the organs of your body. Every cell and organ in your body needs light information, and the way to get that light information to all those cells, because you have a thick skull and the inside of you is dark inside your skin, there's no sunlight getting in there, is by viewing sunlight with your eyes at the two times of day that I'm referring to, okay? That's the only route. There was a study published in \\\"Science,\\\" an excellent journal, well over 10 years ago, that showed that light shone on the back of the knee could set these circadian rhythms, that study was retracted, and unfortunately, most people don't know that it was retracted, there were some experimental flaws, that people were actually viewing light through their eyes. That study was repeated, turns out, there is no extraocular photo reception in humans. Whatever somebody tells you that light to the skin or light to the wherever is beneficial for your health, we can talk about that, but there's no way that light information is setting your clocks, you need these cells in your eyes to perceive or to see light at the particular times of day that I'm referring to. Some animals, like snakes and other reptiles, actually have a hole in the top of their skull to get light information directly to their pineal to suppress melatonin. We don't have that hole, I mean, most of you don't have holes in your skull. These holes in your skull that we call the sockets for the eyes are actually there primarily to allow light information to this central clock, and then vision and pattern vision and color vision came much later in evolution, we know this on the basis of genetic studies we get to discuss in a future podcast. So get that light information to the cells of your brain and body by viewing sunlight at the two times of day that I referred to. There's always a lot of questions about, \\\"How long, how much, how do I know if I've had enough?\\\" You'll know because your rhythm will start to fall into some degree of normalcy, you'll start to wake up at more or less the same time each day, you'll fall asleep more easily at night, generally, it takes about two or three days for these systems to align, so if you've not been doing these behaviors, it's gonna take a few days, but they can have tremendous benefits, and sometimes rather quickly, on a number of different mental and physical aspects of your health. Now let's talk about the bad effects of light because light is not supposed to arrive in our system at any time, and nowadays, because of screens and artificial light, we have access to light at times of day and night that normally we wouldn't. Now, earlier I said that you need a lot of light, in particular, sunlight, to set these clock mechanisms, that's true, but there's a kind of diabolical feature to the way all of this works, which is the longer you've been awake, the more sensitive your retina and these cells are to light, so that if you've been awake for 10, 12, 14 hours, it becomes very easy for even a small amount of light coming from a screen or from an overhead light to trigger the activation of the clock and make you feel like you wanna stay up later, make it harder to fall asleep, and disrupt your sleep pattern, okay? So the simple way to think about this is you want as much light as is safely possible early in the day, morning and throughout the day, including blue light, so take those blue blockers off during the day unless you have a real issue with screen light sensitivity, and you want as little light coming into your eyes, artificial or sunlight, after, say, 8:00 p.m., and certainly, you do not want to get bright light exposure to your eyes between 11:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m., and here's why, David Berson, who I mentioned before, and another and friend and colleague, Samer Hattar, who's director of the chronobiology unit at the National Institutes of Mental Health published a paper in \\\"Cell,\\\" which is a journal, another excellent journal, very high stringency, showing that light that arrives to the eyes between 11:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m., approximately, suppresses the release of dopamine, this neuromodulator that makes us feel good, and it's sort of an endogenous antidepressant, and can inhibit learning and create all sorts of other detrimental effects, it does this through a mechanism, for those of you that wanna know the neural pathways, that involves light to the eyes that's then signaled to a structure called the habenula, the habenula looks like two little bat ears sitting right in the middle of a structure in your brain called the thalamus, don't worry about these names if you're not interested in this stuff, if you are, these are just avenues to explore, when that habenula gets activated it's actually called the disappointment nucleus because it actually makes us feel less happy and more disappointed, and can lead to certain forms of depression in the wakeful state. Now, if you wake up in the middle of the night and you need to use the bathroom or you're on an all-night flight and you're, you know, need to read or whatever it is, fine, every once in a while, it's not gonna be a problem to get bright light exposure to your eyes in the middle of the night, but if you think about our lifestyle nowadays and being up late looking at phones, even if you dim that screen, you're triggering this activation because your retinal sensitivity and the sensitivity of these neurons has gone up late in the day. Now, I'm not here to dictate what you should or shouldn't do, but for those of you that are experiencing challenges with mood, those of you that have anxiety, learning problems, issues focusing, the questions I usually get are, \\\"How can I focus better?\\\" Well, we will get to that, but one of the best ways you can support your mechanisms for good mood, mental health, learning, focus, metabolism, et cetera, is to take control of this light exposure behavior at night and not get much or any bright light exposure in the middle of the night. Red light won't trigger this pathway, but very few people have the kind of infrared lights that are set up, or floor lights, and that brings me to an important point, which is about the location of light, this hasn't been discussed much out there, I don't think, these cells in our eye, these neurons that signal the central clock, reside mostly, not exclusively, but mostly, in the bottom half of our retina, and because we have a lens in front of our retina, and because of the optics of lenses, that means that these cells are actually viewing our upper visual field, there's an inversion of the visual image, et cetera, you can look that up if you wanna learn more about retinal optics, it's fascinating, but not the topic for today. These cells are in the bottom half of your retina mostly, and so they're viewing the overhead visual space around you. This is probably not coincidental that these cells were essentially designed to detect sunlight, which is overhead, of course, so if you want to avoid improper activation of these neurons, it's better to place lights that you use in the evening low in your physical environment, so on desktops or even the floor, if you wanna go that way, as opposed to overhead lights, so overhead florescent lights would be the worst, that would be the worst case scenario, lights that are overhead that are a little bit softer, of the sort or yellow or reddish tints, would be slightly better, but dim lights that are set low in the room are going to be best because they aren't going to activate these neurons and therefore shift your circadian clock, so that's a goal. Some people, like Samer Hattar that I mentioned earlier, he turns his home basically into a cave in the evenings. Candlelight actually does not trigger activation of these cells, so candlelight and fireplaces and campfires are fine, dim lights, very dim lights are fine, and lights low in the physical environment, of course, the problem with candlelight and fireplaces is the fire hazard, but you're smart people, you know what to do about that. Don't burn down whatever structure you're in, including forests, please. So, keep the lights low in in your environment. What if you wake up in the middle of the night and you find yourself watching TV or on the computer? Well, in that case, you might wanna wear blue blockers, and you certainly would wanna dim the screen, but ideally, you're not doing that, it's remarkable the positive effects of getting that bit of sunlight early in the day, maybe even also around sunset, and avoiding bright lights, and especially overhead bright lights, between about 11:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.. Now, I'm not talking about shift work, I'm realizing that we're probably gonna have to have an entire discussion devoted just to shift workers because there's some good information there about how they can protect themselves against some of the very bad health effects of shift work, of getting light in the middle of the night, but we rely on shift workers and they're super important to culture and society and the economy, so I wanna acknowledge them and let you know that we will do a discussion about shift work and jet lag, but let's talk about what light can do in terms of shifting us in healthy ways. So the way to think about this whole system, again, is you've got adenosine building up depending on how long you've been awake and it's making you sleepy, and then you've got the circadian mechanisms that are timing your wakefulness and timing when you wanna be asleep, mainly through cortisol and melatonin, but there are a bunch of other things that are downstream of cortisol and melatonin, like, we tend to be hungrier during our wakeful period than late at night, some people like to eat late at night, but if you're finding that you can't become a day person or a morning person, shifting your light exposure, exercise, and food intake to the daytime will help. Some people like to stop eating around 6:00 or 8:00 p.m. because of metabolic reasons or they're trying to maintain their weight or lose weight, that's actually not supported so well by the literature, the literature around nutrition essentially says that it's best to restrict your feeding to a certain period of each 24-hour cycle to not be eating around the clock, and whether or not that's 4 hours or 8 hours or 16 hours is a much lengthier discussion than we have time for now, I would refer you to Satchin Panda's book, \\\"The Circadian Code,\\\" which talks all about that, he's an expert, a former colleague of mine from the Salk Institute in San Diego, you can explore intermittent and circadian fasting, so to speak, through Satchin's literature, we'll talk about that, we might even get Satchin in here if we're lucky at some point in the future, but you can actually use light to wake up earlier. Jamie Zeitzer and colleagues did a beautiful study showing that, if you turn on the lights before waking up, so around 45 minutes to an hour before waking up, even if your eyelids are closed, provided you're not under the covers, after doing that for a few days, that increases your total sleep time and shifts forward the time at which you feel sleepy, it makes you want to go to bed earlier each night. Now, in a kind of diabolical way, they did this with teenagers who are notorious for wanting to wake up late and stay up late, and what they found was bright light flashes, just turning on the lights in their environment, overhead lights, because they're trying to activate this system and that's why they're using overhead lights, even through the eyelids, before these kids woke up, then made those kids naturally wanna go to bed earlier and they ended up sleeping longer, so that's something you could try, you could put your lights on a timer to go on early in the day before you wake up, you could open your blinds so that sunlight is coming through, and again, if you curl up under the covers, then it's not gonna reach these neurons, but it's remarkable that light can actually penetrate the eyelids, activate these neurons, and go to the central clock. That study illustrates a really important principle of how you're built, which is, you have the capacity for what are called phase advances and phase delays, and I don't wanna complicate this too much, so the simplest way to think about phase advances and phase delays is that if you see light late in the day, and in particular, in the middle of the night, your brain and body, for reasons that now you understand, will think that that's morning light even though it's not sunlight because you have this heightened sensitivity, and it will phase delay, it will delay your clock, it will essentially make you want to get up later and go to sleep later, so if you get light exposure too late in the evening or in the middle of the night, it's going to make it hard to want to wake up that next morning early and to go to bed early. The opposite is also true, if you wake up early, say, 6:00 a.m. or 7:00 a.m., and get light exposure, or even earlier, 4:00 a.m., and get light exposure, it will phase-advance your clock, okay? It's gonna make your clock think it's earlier and you'll wanna wake up earlier, so the simple way to think about this is if you're having trouble waking up early and feeling alert early in the day, you're going to wanna try and get bright light exposure even before waking up because it will advance your clock, it's sort of like turning the clock forward, whereas if you are having trouble waking up early, you definitely don't want to get too much light exposure or any light exposure to your eyes late in the evening and in the middle of the night because it's just gonna delay your clock more and more, so rather than get into the specifics of everybody's situation because there are many of you out there with different situations and lifestyle requirements, et cetera, the way to think about this is that you have these internal mechanisms of adenosine and circadian clocks, and they're always operating, and what you're trying to do is provide them anchors, you're trying to provide them consistent, powerful anchors so that your cortisol, your melatonin, and then everything that cascades down from that, like your metabolism and your ability to learn and your sense of alertness, your dopamine, your serotonin, all that stuff is timed regularly, one of the reasons why there's so much challenge out there with focus and anxiety and depression, there are a lot of reasons for that, but one of the reasons is that people's internal mechanisms aren't anchored to anything regular. Now, this doesn't require being neurotically attached to getting up at a very specific time, going outside, viewing the sunlight at the same time every day, these systems, again, will average, but if you can provide them consistent light anchors early in the day and in the evening, and avoiding light at night, you will be amazed at the tremendous number of positive effects that can come from that at the level of metabolic factors, hormones, and just general feelings of wellbeing, in fact, most of us are familiar with what it is to not sleep well and all the terrible effects that has, maybe one night you're fine, two nights even, for the new parents out there, I sympathize with you, but most people are not familiar with what it is to sleep really, really well on a consistent basis, and when you start doing that by controlling your sleep environment, right, get the proper sleep surface, get the proper pillow, get the temperature in the room right, get your light exposure right, start timing your exercise at normal periods or times throughout the day and week, it's amazing how many other biological systems just naturally fall in line, and this is why whenever people ask me, \\\"What should I take?\\\" which is one of the most common questions I get, \\\"What supplement should I take? \\\"What drug should I be taking? \\\"What things should I be taking?\\\" The first question I always ask them is, \\\"How's your sleep?\\\" and 90% of the time, they tell me they either have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep or they don't feel rested throughout the day. A brief note about naps, naps, provided that they're less than one ultradian cycle, provided they're 20 minutes or 30 minutes or even an hour, can be very beneficial for a lot of people, you don't have to take them, but many people naturally feel a dip in energy and focus late in the afternoon, in fact, if we were gonna look at wakefulness, what we would find is that you get that morning light exposure, hopefully, your cortisol goes up, people will start feeling awake, and then around two, or three, or four in the afternoon, there's a spike in everything from alertness to ability to learn, some metabolic factors drop, and then it just naturally comes back up, and then it tapers off as the night goes on. So for some of you, naps are great, I love taking naps, some people, they wake up from naps feeling really groggy, that's probably because they're not sleeping as well as they should at night or as long as they should at night, and so they're dropping into REM sleep or deeper forms of sleep in the day time, and then they wake up and they feel kind of disoriented, other people feel great after a nap, so that's another case where, just like with caffeine, so sort of have to evaluate for yourself. As we discuss this, you're probably realizing this is a lot like nutrition where nowadays it's just crazy, I mean, if you go on social media, it's like you've got people who are pushing carnivore, you've got other people who are pushing vegan, other people who are pushing paleo, every variation of every diet, and there's a lot of data to support any and all of those and the arguments go on and on, and there's probably a lot of genetic variation and lifestyle variation that's going to dictate whether or not something is good for you, whether or not you like it, whether or not you'll stick to it. The same thing is true for circadian and sleep and wakefulness behaviors, except the light-viewing behavior that I talked about before, there's no way around that, that's hardwired into our system, the same way we could factually say that everybody needs some nutrition at some level from some source, everybody needs light information arriving in their system in some way at regular intervals, so that's really what this is about. Okay, so naps are gonna be good for some people, not for others, I have a colleague, a very accomplished neuroscientist, who likes to take naps just after lunch, I personally like to take a nap around 3:00 or 4:00 p.m., but there's a practice that I've adopted in the last 5 years that I've found to be immensely beneficial that is sort of like napping but isn't napping, it's a thing that they call yoga nidra, yoga nidra actually means yoga sleep, and it's a sort of meditation that you listen to, there are number of scripts, I've talked about this on podcasts before but I'm going to post a link to the two that I like most, that allows you to consciously bring your entire body and mind into a state of deep relaxation, and sometimes you fall asleep and sometimes you don't, this is done for 10 to 30 or even 60 minutes at a time. The other thing that works really well is meditation, so I'm talking about naps, but I'm also talking about yoga nidra, which is sort of a form of meditation, and then more standard forms of meditation, all three of those do something powerful which is that they bring our mind into a state of less so-called sympathetic nervous system activation, go back and listen to episode one if that doesn't make any sense, which is what governs your alertness, and instead, it activates cells and circuits in your body that promote the parasympathetic nervous system, or the calming system. A lot of people are not good falling asleep because they're not good at calming down, so some people have no trouble falling asleep, but many people have a hard time falling asleep, or at least every once in a while experience challenges falling asleep. I don't have problems falling asleep most nights, but I've noticed that if I'm working very hard or if the world is particularly stressful, my mind gets into a bit of a kind of OCD loop where I tend to ruminate on things, and I'm not even thinking about anything in particular, it's just challenging for me to disengage and fall asleep. Meditation and yoga nidra scripts have been immensely helpful for me in terms of accelerating the transition to sleep, so they involve taking a few minutes, 10 to 30 minutes or so, just like you would for a nap, and just listening to a script, almost passively, and it has you do some particular patterns of breathing and some other kind of body-scan-like things that can really help people learn to relax, not just in that moment, but get better at relaxing and turning off thinking in order to fall asleep when they wanna do that at night. There's another thing that's similar to this, which is certain forms of hypnosis for sleep, for that, I'll just refer you to the website of a colleague and collaborator of mine, David Spiegel, who's our associate chair of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford, he's developed a website, which is reverie, R-E-V-E-R-I-E, health.com, so reveriehealth.com, that has a lot of science-supported, clinically supported hypnosis scripts that essentially take the brain into states of deep relaxation for the sake of rewiring the brain and neuroplasticity, but one of those scripts that's there and is available free is for sleep, and we'll talk more about hypnosis at a later time because it has a ton of other effects that aren't just limited to sleep. So a period of time each day that you devote to getting better at falling and staying asleep is actually a really good practice to adopt. The other thing about these practices like meditation, yoga nidra, and hypnosis, is people would always say to me, \\\"Well, when should I do them?\\\" and I always say, \\\"Well, the best time of day to do it \\\"is when you first wake up in the morning, \\\"provided you've gotten your sunlight already, \\\"anytime you wake up in the middle of the night, \\\"or any time of day.\\\" In other words, they're always good for you because it's a training mechanism by which you self-train your nervous system to go from a state of heightened alertness that you don't want to heightened relaxation that you do want, and so it's really teaching you to hit the brake, and that brings us to an even more important point, perhaps, which is, we've all experienced that we can stay up if we want to, right? If we wanna stay up late on New Year's or we wanna push an all-nighter, some people can do that more easily than others, but we're all capable of doing that, but it's very hard to make ourselves fall asleep, and so there's a sort of asymmetry to the way our autonomic nervous system, which governs this alertness-calmness thing, the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system, there's an asymmetry there where we are more easily able to engage wakefulness and drive wakefulness, we can force ourselves to stay awake, than we are able to force ourselves to fall asleep, and one of the things that I say over and over again, and I'm gonna continue to say over and over again, is it's very hard to control the mind with the mind, when you have trouble falling asleep, you need to look to some mechanism that involves the body, and all the things I described, meditation, hypnosis, yoga nidra, all involve exhale-emphasized breathing, certain ways of lying down and controlling the body, we're gonna get into breathing in real depth at another time, but all of those involve using the body to control the mind rather than trying to, you know, wrestle your mind into a certain pattern of relaxation, so earlier in episode one, I talked about the Mobius strip, this continuous loop that is the brain-body relationship, or the mind-body relationship, and when we're having trouble controlling the mind, I encourage people to look towards the body, look toward sunlight, avoid sunlight and bright light if that happens to be late at night, so there's a theme that's starting to emerge which is, in order to control this thing that we call the nervous system, we have to look back to some of the things we discussed earlier, like sensation, perception, et cetera, but we have to ask, what can we control? Well, I'm talking about controlling light exposure, controlling your breathing and body, I'm not going into details right now but you can see the yoga nidra script or the reveriehealth.com, or Headspace would be a great place to adopt a meditation practice, any of those are really teaching you to use your body to control your mind, and to allow you to explore the mind-body relationship in a way that gives you more control over your mind and the mind-body relationship, okay? So we talked about light, we talked about activity and timing of light, we talked about the usefulness of naps, and these things that I'm calling non-sleep deep rest, which include meditation, yoga nidra, and hypnosis, non-sleep deep rest, or what I, hereafter, we will refer to as NSDR, not to be confused with EMDR, I don't think I've ever heard NSDR, so I'm planting a flag for NSDR, non-sleep deep rest, as a way to reset one's ability to be awake after you emerge from NSDR, so to get some more wakefulness and ability to attend, some emotional stability, reset, as well as make it better and easier to fall asleep when you wanna go to sleep at night. Now, the non-sleep deep rest does have some research to support it, there's a beautiful study done out of a university in Denmark, I will later provide a link to that study, that showed that this meditation and yoga nidra-type meditation allows dopamine and other neuromodulators in an area of the brain called the striatum that's involved in motor planning and motor execution, to reset itself, in other words, this NSDR can reset our ability to engage in the world in a way that's very deliberate, and not to throw in another acronym, but NSDR resets your ability to engage in DPOs, duration, path, and outcome, so now you're probably rolling your eyes like, \\\"Oh my goodness, the number of acronyms,\\\" but just bear with me because NSDR is so powerful, because first of all, it doesn't require that you rig yourself to any device, it doesn't require that you take much time out of your day, it doesn't require that you ingest anything, except air, and it can have so many positive effects right down to the neuromodulator level, so I think in the years to come, my lab's exploring this in a collaboration with David Spiegel's lab, but other labs are looking at this as well, I think NSDR is going to start to play a more prominent role in what we call wellness and health, both mental health and physical health, so I encourage you to explore those practices. Okay, so what about things that we can and maybe should or should not take in order to control and access better sleep and better wakefulness? We've talked about things you can do or not do, we've talked about nutrition and the timing of nutrition, now let's talk about compounds, those could be prescription drugs, those could be supplements, there are a number of different things that will affect your circadian timing and behavior, in fact, almost everything that you could take will affect your circadian timing and behavior, that's right. So years ago when I was in graduate school, I had a professor, unfortunately, he passed away now, but his name was Ted Jones, the late Edward Jones, who was a world-class neuroanatomist, he wrote the book on the thalamus, in fact, it's called \\\"The Thalamus,\\\" and an expert on patterns of activation in the brain during sleep, and I'll never forget that during one of these lectures, someone asked Ted the question, \\\"What is the effect of some drug \\\"on these waves of activity in the thalamus?\\\" or something, and his answer was incredible. Now, he was a pretty gruff guy, and so his answer was delivered in the form of a kind of aggressive direct statement, he said, \\\"A drug is a substance \\\"that when injected into a person, \\\"produces a scientific publication,\\\" and what he was saying is actually quite true, which is that most every compound will have some effect on some aspect of biology, this is why it's hard to sort through everything that's on PubMed, if you put any molecule or compound or drug into PubMed and then you put sleep next to it, or alertness next to it, you're likely to find a paper where there's an effect, but that's not necessarily telling you that that drug is helpful for that, what it's telling you is that anytime you change what you take or you stop taking something, say you're taking sleeping pills, Ambien or whatever it is, and you stop taking them, your sleep behavior will change. Let's stay you take an aspirin and you don't normally take aspirin, you will shift your circadian rhythm, now you might not shift it perceptibly, you might not create problems for yourself, but anytime you ingest a compound at high potency, you're going to provide some shift to your circadian rhythm. Now, that said, there are a couple things that are directly in line with the biology related to falling and staying asleep and directly in line with the biology of wakefulness, there's a whole category of things, like stimulants, cocaine, amphetamine, and prescription stimulants, that are, the prescription ones were designed for the treatment of narcolepsy, so things like modafinil or armodafinil that are designed to created wakefulness, they are all essentially chemical variants of things that increase epinephrine and dopamine. Now, of course, I'm of the standpoint that things like cocaine and amphetamine are just across the board bad, they have so many addictive and terrible effects, in the proper setting prescribed by the proper professional, things like modafinil for narcolepsy might be appropriate, I know that a lot of people out there take Adderall, even though they haven't been prescribed Adderall, in order to increase wakefulness, that is essentially, well, it's illegal for one, but also it's abusing the system in the sense that you're pushing back on the adenosine system slightly differently than you do caffeine, it will make you feel more alert, there tends to be a heavy rebound and they do have an addictive potential, there are also some other effects of those that could be quite bad, so we're gonna explore stimulants in a whole month related to drugs, but there are some supplements and some things that are safer, certainly safer, and that, in cases where you're doing all the right behaviors, you're exercising and eating correctly and you're still having trouble with sleep, that can be beneficial for falling and staying asleep. Now, I wanna be very clear, I am not pushing supplements, I am just pointing you toward some things that have been shown in peer-reviewed studies to have some benefit. The first one is magnesium, there are many forms of magnesium, but certain forms of magnesium can have positive effects on sleepiness and the ability to stay asleep, mainly by way of increasing neurotransmitters like GABA which help turn off the DPO, the kind of thinking about the future, duration-path-outcome analysis, and make one's mind kind of drift in space and time and make it easier to fall asleep, there are a lot of forms of magnesium out there, but in particular is magnesium threonate, T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E, which you have to check to see if this is right for you, check with your doctor, but magnesium threonate is associated with transporters in the body that bring more of it into cells that allow people to feel this kind of drowsiness and help them fall asleep, so I personally, I can only talk about what I personally do, I personally take 3 or 400 milligrams of magnesium threonate about 30 to 60 minutes before sleep, and it helps me fall asleep. The other thing is theanine, T-H-E-A, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine, 100 to 200 milligrams of theanine, for me, also helps me turn off my mind and fall asleep, I take it 30 to 60 minutes throughout the day. Interestingly, theanine is now being introduced to a lot of energy drinks in order to take away the jitters that are associated with drinking too much caffeine or with some other things that are in the energy drinks, energy drinks can be problematic, they can contain a lot of L-taurine, I'll just tell you an anecdote, when I was a postdoc, I was drinking a lot of a particular energy drink, it has a lot of taurine in it, and actually the whites of my eyes, the sclera, as it's called, of my eyes turned beet red, and I went to a friend who's an ophthalmologist, I said, \\\"Look, I'm not a marijuana smoker, \\\"I haven't been hit on the head, \\\"I don't know what's going on,\\\" and he looked and he said, \\\"I think you've got some microvascular damage,\\\" and we walked through what I was taking and doing, and he said, \\\"Oh, it's probably the taurine, \\\"excessive levels of taurine \\\"can create some microvascular damage.\\\" So if you're having microvascular damage in your eye, you probably have microvascular damage deeper in your skull, so I stopped, that's the reason why I don't take energy drinks, so just a consideration, again, I'm not here to tell you what to do or not do, but just wanna arm you with information. The thing about theanine and magnesium is taken together, they do, for some people, they can make them so sleepy and sleep so deeply that they actually have trouble waking up in the morning, so you have to play with these things and titrate them if you decide to use them, again, if you decide to go this route, I would not start by taking supplements, I would start by getting your light-viewing behavior correct, and then think about your nutrition and then think about your activity and then think about whether or not you wanna supplement, we already talked about melatonin earlier. There's another supplement that could be quite useful, which is apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, which is a derivative of chamomile, 50 milligrams of apigenin also can augment or support this kind of creation of a sleepiness to help fall asleep and stay asleep. A note about sleepwalkers and people with very vivid dreams, theanine can often make your dreams very vivid, sleepwalkers should be careful about taking theanine, everyone should be careful about taking anything, and don't take anything without consulting your board-certified M.D. or healthcare professional first, okay? Your health is your responsibility, I am not gonna take responsibility for what you decide to do experimentally in any case, but especially as it relates to supplementation and drugs. As a important point, apigenin is a fairly potent estrogen inhibitor, so women who want to keep their estrogen levels high, or at whatever levels they happen to be at, should probably avoid apigenin altogether, and men, take that into consideration as well, men need estrogen also, you don't wanna completely eliminate your estrogen, that it can create all sorts of bad effects on libido and cognition, et cetera, so apigenin in some people is gonna be a pretty strong estrogen inhibitor, so keep that in mind. There are other things you can take to help you sleep better, those are the legal ones that, at least I'm aware of, have pretty broad safety margins, but again, you need to explore your safety margins with any compound. I think a great website that I can refer you to is examine.com, examine, the word, just as it sounds, .com, is a website, I have no relation to them, but there, you can find links to peer-reviewed studies for any compound or supplement, as well as some important warnings related to the things I discussed, as well as any other thing that you might decide to supplement with or ingest to help improve your sleep. Okay, that was a lot of information about how to get better at sleeping, falling asleep, wakefulness, et cetera. An important feature of this podcast, as you know, is that we dive deep into topics for several episodes at a time, at least a month at a time, so by stopping here, I recognize that there are probably many more questions that you still have, and the great thing about that is that we have another episode coming up soon, I'm going to hold office hours where I'm going to answer your specific questions about episodes one and two, so if you have questions about this episode, you have questions about episode one, write them down, put them in the comments, I'll also do a post on Instagram where you can put them in the comments there, but put them in the comments to this episode as well, please recommend the podcast if you like it, please subscribe to it here on YouTube, please subscribe to it on Apple, we're now on Spotify as well, recommend it to a friend, the community that we're creating here around these topics of sleep and wakefulness and other neuroscience- and health-related themes is best supported by your involvement and your questions, and so I'm going to be reading all of your questions, distilling those into the most commonly asked questions and liked questions, so if you see something below that you are particularly interested in, you don't have to put that question in again, you can just give it a like, the little thumbs-up tab, and if you're listening to this on Spotify or Apple, please go to YouTube, subscribe, and put your question there, or check out the Huberman Lab Instagram and you can put your questions there so that next episode, I can answer those questions and then we can move forward even more deeply into these critical topics around sleep and wakefulness so that you can be armed with all the information and resources that you need. Last but not least, a number of you have very graciously asked how you can support the podcast, the best way to support the podcast is to subscribe on YouTube or one of the other platforms, we are now on Spotify and Apple, and the other way you can really support the podcast is to check out our sponsors, which were discussed at the beginning. So thank you so much for your time and attention, and above all, thank you for your interest in science. (energetic music)\",\n          \"- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. [cheerful music] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, we are discussing aggression. I'm going to explain to you that there are several different types of aggression, for instance, reactive aggression versus proactive aggression. Meaning sometimes people will be aggressive because they feel threatened or they are protecting those that they love, who also feel threatened. There's also proactive aggression where people go out of their way to deliberately try and harm others. And there is indirect aggression, which is aggression, not involving physical violence, for instance, shaming people and things of that sort. It turns out that there are different biological mechanisms underlying each of the different types of aggression. And today I will define those for you. I'll talk about the neural circuits in the brain and body that mediate each of the different kinds of aggression. Talk about some of the hormones and peptides and neurotransmitters involved. I promise to make it all accessible to you, even if you do not have any biology or science background, I will also discuss tools, psychological tools and biological tools that one can use to better control aggression. Now, right here at the outset, I want to acknowledge that any discussion about aggression has to have an element of context within it. To be fair, human beings invest a lot of money, a lot of time, and a lot of energy, and indeed can even derive pleasure from aggression. Later I'll talk about neural circuits in the brain and body that reinforce, in other words, reward through the release of chemicals that make people feel good. Acts of aggression. However, what I'm mainly referring to is the context in which human beings will pay money in order to derive what we call vicarious aggression, put it simply people spend an enormous amount of money and time and energy watching other people engage in, for instance, aggressive sports. And we know that observing your team winning over another team causes the release of neurochemicals in your brain and body that make you feel good. And yes, that can make you feel more aggressive. We also know of course that most governments invest many billions if not trillions of dollars in infrastructure, technologies and human beings in order to engage in aggression if needed, so-called military warfare, et cetera. So today's discussion will include a description of aggression in the pathological sense. We'll actually talk about an explosive aggressive disorder that most of you probably haven't heard of, but is actually far more common than perhaps, you know, we'll talk about the role of things like attention deficit, hyperactivity disorder, and how that can relate to aggression through the relationship between impulsivity and aggression. And we'll talk about verbal aggression, physical aggression, proactive aggression, as mentioned before, and reactive aggression. I'm certain that by the end of the episode, you will come away with a much more thorough understanding of what this thing that we call aggression really is. And when you see it in other people, I think it will make more sense to you. And when you observe it in yourself or the impulse to engage in aggression, verbal, or physical or otherwise, I hope that you'll understand it better as well. And of course, the tools that I will describe should allow you to modulate and control aggressive tendencies or predispositions to aggressiveness and just generally to be able to engage with people in a more adaptive way overall. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink that's designed to meet all your foundational health needs. I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or twice a day is that it covers all of my basic vitamin mineral and probiotic needs. The probiotics are especially important to me. There are now abundant data showing that the gut microbiome, which is basically a community of trillions of little bacteria that live in our guts are beneficial for our immune system, for brain function, for mood and many other aspects of our health. The gut microbiome thrives on probiotics and Athletic Greens contains the proper array of probiotics to optimize the gut microbiome. Athletic Greens also has adaptogens for recovery from physical and mental exertion, digestive enzymes for gut health, vitamin C, zinc, as I mentioned before, all the other vitamins and minerals that you need in order to cover your basic needs each day. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and claim a special offer. That'll give you five free travel packs that make it easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road and a year supply of Vitamin D3K2. There's now a wealth of data showing that vitamin D3 is important for many aspects of our immediate and long term health. Many people, even if they get out in the sunlight are not getting enough Vitamin D3, and the K2 is thought to be beneficial for calcium regulation and a number of other things important to our health. So again, if you go to athleticGreens.com/huberman, you can claim the special offer of the five free travel packs and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2. Today's episode is also brought to us by ROKA. ROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses that are the absolute highest quality. The company was founded by two All-American swimmers from Stanford and everything about their eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind, I've spent a lifetime working on the biology of the visual system, I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with some pretty tough challenges as you move throughout the day. For instance, if you go from a brightly lit region to a dimmer region, your visual system has to adjust. ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with those sorts of adjustments in mind. So for instance, if you're outside in the shade, you move into the sun and then back into the shade, you don't have to take your sunglasses on and off. Their glasses were initially designed for sports performance and the great thing is they could be used for that, but also they have a terrific aesthetic, so you can wear them to work or out to dinner. I wear readers at night and when I drive at night and I wear sunglasses, if I'm out a lot on really bright days. The terrific thing about ROKA glasses is that even if you get sweaty, they won't fall off. So you can run with them, you can cycle with them. Or as I mentioned before, you can just wear them out and about. If you'd like to try ROKA, you can go to roka.com, that's R-O-K-A.com and enter the code \\\"Huberman\\\" to save 20% off your first order. Again, that's ROKA roka.com and enter the code \\\"Huberman\\\" at checkout. Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep. Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows that in my opinion are the very best you'll find. I started sleeping on a Helix mattress a little over a year ago, and it's the best sleep I've had ever since. If you go to the Helix site, they have a terrific sleep quiz that just takes a few minutes, ask you questions like, \\\"Do you tend to sleep on your side, your back or your stomach?\\\" Maybe you don't know because you're asleep, but many people do know. And even if you don't know that's okay, it will also ask you questions like, \\\"Do you tend to run hot or cold?\\\" Do you tend to wake up in the middle of the night or not? And by taking that brief quiz, they will match you to the specific mattress that's ideal for you and your sleep needs. And that's really what sets Helix Sleep mattresses apart. Everybody's unique, and they know that. So if you take this quiz, you'll get matched to a particular mattress. For me, it was the \\\"Dusk\\\" mattress D-U-S-K, but again, that's just me, and you may match to that one, or you may match to a different one. If you're interested in upgrading your mattress and sleeping much better, go to helixsleep.com/huberman. Take that two minute sleep quiz and they'll match you to a customized mattress and you'll get up to $200 off any mattress order and two free pillows. I also love their pillows. I've always had this issue with pillows that they heat up too much. I'm always looking for the pillow that can cool itself. Somehow the pillows stay nice and cool. They're also not too big, so I'm not propped up, not getting the Text Neck in the middle of the night, where I'm letting my chin push my chest, nor am I falling back and having trouble breathing in the middle of the night. They're designed just right. They also have a 10 years warranty and you get to try it out for a hundred nights, risk free. They'll even pick it up for you if you don't love it. But I think that you will. Again, if you're interested, you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman for up to $200 off and two free pillows. Let's talk about aggression. I think that many people out there are put off by aggression, although others are drawn to aggression both in themselves and when observing it in others. The reason to talk about aggression is, that as mentioned before, the context of aggression really matters. So there are instances where aggression is adaptive. For instance, a mother protecting her children if she's being attacked, or if her children are being threatened. I think most people would agree that so-called maternal aggression of that sort, provided the context is right, is a great thing. Protecting our young is after all one of the primary adaptive drives of our species, and thank goodness it is. Of course, other forms of aggression like unprovoked, proactive aggression, somebody simply being violent to somebody else, even when unprovoked, most of us cringe when we see that kind of behavior, it can even evoke aggression in people when they observe that kind of behavior. So again, context really matters, but a more general and perhaps an even more important reason to think about and understand aggression is that by understanding the biology and psychology of aggression, you will be in a much better position to understand how all emotional states come to be, both in yourself and in others. For instance, many of you have probably heard the statement that I believe arises from pop psychology, not from formal academic psychology, that aggression is just sadness. It's a form of sadness that's amplified and it shows up as aggression. But when we look at the underlying biology and the peer reviewed literature on this, nothing could be further from the truth. We have distinct circuits in the brain for aggression versus grief and mourning, those are non-overlapping. Now that doesn't mean that you can't be sad and aggressive or in a state of mourning and aggressive at the same time, but the idea that sadness and aggression are one in the same thing is simply not true. And by understanding that, or perhaps by understanding that irritability and aggression are not the same thing, you'll be in a much better position to apply some of the tools that we will talk about in this episode in order to be able to reduce or eliminate, or if it's adaptive to you to modulate aggression. And yes, there are cases where modulating your aggression in some cases, even amplifying aggression can be adaptive. Now this of course is not the first discussion about the biology of aggression or the psychology of aggression. And we really can look to the beginning of the last century as the time in which the formal study of aggression really began. One of the names that's most associated with the formal study of aggression is none other than Konrad Lorenz. Some of you may be familiar with that name, others of you may not be familiar with that name. Konrad Lorenz studied so-called imprinting behaviors and fixed action pattern behaviors. He's most famous, at least in scientific circles, for getting geese to believe that he was their parent. And if you were to put into Google Conrad with a K, Lorenz, just as it sounds, Konrad Lorenz, geese, you're going to see a lot of photos of Conrad walking down roads with a lot of geese following him or swimming in lakes with a lot of geese following him. He had a habit of geese adopting him because of the behaviors that he partook in. So he would swim out on a lake in front of a bunch of little geese and then they would think that he was the parent and they would imprint on him. He even lived with these animals and they lived with him, sort of a strange character from what I hear. But nonetheless, all this work was deserving of a Nobel prize because what he discovered were fixed action patterns. That is patterns of behavior that could be evoked by a single stimulus. Okay. This is really important. The idea that you can get a whole category of behaviors, like swimming behind a parent, or looking to somebody for comfort, and only them, the idea that you could get a huge category of different behaviors in a bunch of different contexts triggered by just the presence of that person is remarkable, because what it suggested and what turns out to be true is that there are neural circuits, not just individual brain areas, but collections of brain areas that work together to engage a pattern of behaviors. And that's the first fundamental principle that we need to define today, that when we talk about aggression, we are talking about activation of neural circuits, not individual brain areas, but neural circuits that get played out in sequence like keys on a piano, but that playing out in sequence means that aggression is a verb. It has a beginning, a middle and an end, and it's a process. It's not an event. And as you'll see, that turns out to be very important in terms of thinking about how one can halt aggression, prevent it from happening before it's initiated, or maybe even prolonging aggression, if that's what's needed. Now, Konrad Lorenz had no real knowledge of neural circuits. I mean, obviously he knew there was this thing that we call a brain and a nervous system, and he knew that there were chemicals in the brain and hormones and things of that sort that were likely to play a role, but he really didn't take any measures to define what the neural circuits were, frankly, he didn't need to. He had his Nobel prize and he did all this beautiful work. He's known for an abundance of work, but he did think about what sorts of underlying processes could drive something like aggression. And he talked about one particular feature that's especially important, and that's this notion of a pressure. The idea that yes, certain hormones will bias somebody or an animal to be aggressive, certain neural transmitter states, and you'll learn what those are today will bias somebody to be more or less aggressive, maybe even submissive and passive, maybe outright proactively aggressive towards anyone or anything in front of them. And yes, of course there will be historical features based on their childhood, et cetera, et cetera. He understood that there will be a constellation of things that would drive people to be aggressive. And he described a so-called pressure, almost like a hydraulic pressure. Just think about fluid pressure in a small container being pushed, pushed, pushed until the can, or the container is ready to explode and how multiple features, multiple variables could impinge on that and create that pressure. It turns out that's exactly the way the system works. There is no single brain area that flips the switch for aggression. Although we'll soon talk about a brain structure that generally houses the propensity and the output of aggression. This notion of a hydraulic pressure that can drive us toward aggressive behavior or conversely can be very low pressure and keep us in a state of non-reactivity, maybe even passivity or submissiveness is a very important feature because it really captures the essence of how neural circuits work when we're talking about primitive behaviors generally. And you can start to notice this in yourself and in others, you can start to notice when you are veering toward aggression or when someone is veering toward aggression, verbal or physical. Now that veering is the buildup of this hydraulic pressure that Lorenz was referring to, and it really does have an underlying biological basis. Now it was some years later that the first experiments came along, which really started to identify the brain areas and the biological so-called pressures that can induce aggressive behavior. And the person that really gets credit for this is a guy by the name of Walter Hess, who at that time was working on cats. And I know that when say working on cats, a lot of people will cringe. A lot of people have cats as pets, and certainly cats can be delightful. Some people like them more, some people like them less. Most people cringe at the idea of doing experiments on cats. I should say that these days, very few laboratories work on cats. Most laboratories that work on animal models will work on flies, Drosophila fruit flies for their capacity to do genetics, on laboratory mice, sometimes rats, but usually mice. And occasionally you'll find a lab that still works on cats. Back in the time of Hess, very few laboratories worked on mice, most laboratories worked on cats or rats. And the reason for that is nowadays most laboratories use mice if they use animal models because of the genetic tools that exist in mice to knock out this gene or knock in this gene, et cetera, which can't be done in humans or non-human primates, at least not very easily at this point in history. So when I say he was working on cats, I realized that probably evokes some negative emotions in some of you, maybe even aggression in some of you, what we can do, however, is look at the data and make use of the data in terms of our understanding. What Hess did was he had cats that were awake and he was able to lower a stimulating electrode into their brain. Now keep in mind that the brain does not have any pain sensors. So after a small hole is made in the skull, electrodes are lowered into the brain. This is what's done commonly in human neurosurgery. And he was able to stimulate different brain areas and he was sort of poking around. And when I say sort of, he was doing this with some logical intent and purpose, he wasn't just poking around in there for fun. He was trying to identify brain regions that could generate entire categories of behavior, ALA Lorenz, right? These fixed action pattern behaviors. Eventually his electrode landed in a site and he provided electrical stimulation to the cat that caused this otherwise passive purring relaxing cat to suddenly go into an absolute rage. So arched back, hissing hair up. So called piloerection, where the hairs go up, animals try to make themselves as big as possible often when they're aggressive. Drooling, maybe even spitting, believe it or not, cats and other animals can do this. And the cat tried to attack him or anyone else, and anything else, even inanimate objects when he stimulated this particula brain area. So Hess obviously took notice of this incredible transformation in behavior. And the fact that when he turned off the stimulation of this particular brain area, the cat very quickly within seconds, went back to being passive calm kitty. Now, of course, he repeated this experiment in other animals because he had to confirm that it wasn't just happenstance, that there wasn't something unique about this one cat that perhaps he had stimulated an area that had been built up during the kittenhood of this cat and had been reactivated. Maybe this kitten had been traumatized early in life or scared and reactivation of a particular circuit, unique to that cat created this aggressive behavior. That wasn't the case, every cat that he looked at and stimulated this particular brain area, the cat would immediately go into an aggressive, almost rage type behavior. Now, of course we can't anthropomorphize. We don't know what the cat was feeling. For all we know the cat could be happy, although that seems pretty unlikely and later experiments done in mice, but also in humans confirm that indeed, stimulation of this brain area evoked not just behavioral aggression, but also subjective feelings of aggression and anger. So what was this incredible brain area, or rather, I should say, what is the brain area that harbored this incredible capacity to generate aggressive behavior in Hess's experiments? Well, for those of you that are regular listeners of this podcast, you'll probably be relieved to know that today we're going to talk about some new neural circuits, oftentimes we'll center back on the amygdala or the prefrontal cortex, and those names will come up. And for those of you that haven't heard them before, don't worry, I'll make it clear as to what those brain areas are and what they do. But today we're going to talk a lot about the so-called VMH or ventromedial hypothalamus. The ventromedial hypothalamus is a nucleus, meaning a small collection of neurons... What are neurons? Nerve cells, and that small collection of neurons that we call the ventromedial hypothalamus is truly small. It's only about 1,500 neurons on one side of your brain and a matching 1,500 neurons on the other side of your brain and that combined 3000 neurons or so, it's not exactly 3000, but 3000 neurons or so is sufficient to generate aggressive behavior of the sort that Hess observed in the cat, and believe it or not, when you see somebody who's in an act of rage or in an act of verbal aggression or in an act of defensive aggression, protecting their family or loved ones or country, et cetera, almost certainly those neurons are engaged in that behavior. Those neurons are perhaps even generating that behavior. And next I'll describe some experiments that were done just recently within the last 10 years or so, but leading right up until this year and even last month that keep confirming again and again and again, that it is the activity of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus that are both necessary and sufficient to generate the full catalog of aggressive behaviors. Now, before I go further to describe the beautiful recent studies on the VMH, the ventromedial hypothalamus, and the important role of testosterone, and more importantly, estrogen, in the activation of aggressive behavior, that's right. That's soon to be clear to you why that's the case. I want to emphasize that the ventromedial hypothalamus is something that we should all care about. Why? Well, it turns out that many categories of psychiatric disorders, developmental disorders, and psychological challenges, things like schizophrenia, PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, borderline personality disorder, and even certain forms of autism can include elements of aggression and even violence. Now it's certainly not the case that aggression and violence are present in all people who suffer from schizophrenia or PTSD or depression or autism or borderline personality disorder. I'm absolutely not saying that. However, it can be a feature of those. And it's a well described feature in terms of trying to understand the constellation of challenges that people suffer from when they have those. So thinking about the VMH goes way beyond just understanding basic aggression in the context of adaptive aggression. So, you know, when earlier I use the example, maternal aggression, that's one adaptive form of aggression. It also can be pathologic aggression, meaning it can harm ourselves or others. So keep this in mind as we go forward, because later we're going to talk about specific tools designed to modulate or prevent aggression in, for instance, people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and especially kids with ADHD. In the meantime, let's return to the VMH, this relatively small collection of neurons. And the reason I say relatively small is, well, your brain has many hundreds of billions of neurons, maybe even trillions of neurons, the exact number of neurons isn't really clear, but it's a lot. And it certainly is a lot relative to the number of neurons this 3000 or so neurons living in your hypothalamus that can evoke this aggressive response. Experiments done by David Anderson's lab at Caltech were really the first to parse the fine circuitry and to really show that the ventromedial hypothalamus is both necessary and sufficient for aggressive behavior. These are important experiments and they're worth knowing about. What they did was they identified, first of all, where the ventromedial hypothalamus was in the mouse, that was pretty straightforward to do was sort of known before they started these experiments. And then they analyzed which genes, meaning which DNA, which of course becomes RNA and RNA becomes protein, which DNA and therefore which proteins are expressed in particular cells of the ventromedial hypothalamus. And it turns out that there's a particular category of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus that make an estrogen receptor. And it is those neurons in particular that are responsible for generating aggressive behavior. How did they know this? Well, they used a tool that's actually been described by a previous guest of this podcast. We had an episode with the psychiatrist and bioengineer and my colleague at Stanford School of Medicine, Karl Deisseroth, he and others have developed tools that allow people to control the activity of neurons essentially by remote control, by shining light on those neurons. So in the context of an experiment on a mouse, which is what David's lab did, and these were the beautiful experiments of Dayu Lin who's now in her own laboratory at New York University, put a little fiber optic cable down into the brain into the hypothalamus that is of the mouse. The mouse is able to move around in its cage freely moving, even though it has a little tether, this little wire, it's a very thin wire. And that little thin wire is actually a little what we call optrode. And the experimentalist in this case, Dayu, was able to stimulate the turning on of a little bit of blue light and that blue light activated only those estrogen receptor neurons in only the ventromedial hypothalamus and the way she was able to do that, is she had introduced a gene that had been developed by our friend, Karl Deisseroth that allows light to trigger electrical activity in those neurons. So if any of that is confusing, or if all of that is confusing, here's the experiment. There's a mouse in a cage. It has a little wire coming out of its head. It doesn't notice, believe it or not. We know this 'cause it's still eating and mating and doing all the things that mics like to do on a daily basis and sleeping, et cetera. And the mere pressing of a button will activate a little bit of light released at the end of that wire, that light activates particular neurons in this case, it's the estrogen receptor containing neurons in only the ventromedial hypothalamus. When that mouse is in a cage with another mouse, a couple of things happen depending on what the other mouse is, or we could say who the other mouse is. If it's a male mouse and you put in there with a female mouse, the male mouse will attempt to mate with a female mouse provided that the male mouse has gone through puberty. He will try to mount and mate with the female mouse. Now female mice are either in a receptive phase or a non-receptive phase of their so-called estrous cycle. They don't have a menstrual 28 day cycle They have an estrous cycle. And on particular days of the estrous cycle, they are not happy to mate. They will basically keep their hindquarters away from the male mouse at all costs. They'll even attack the male mouse. On certain days of the estrous cycle, however, the female mouse will undergo what's called lordosis, which is an arching of her back and she'll allow the male to mount and mate with her. So a large number of experiments were done, but the first experiment really was to put the male mouse in with a female mouse who's in the so-called receptive phase of estrus. That is, she will allow mating and he starts mating with her and they go through the standard repertoire of mating behaviors that you observe in mice: mounting, thrusting, intromission as it's called in the mouse sex world. Well, I guess I don't know what the mice call it, but that's what the experimenters call it. And then afterwards that he will dismount, okay. So they observe this kind of mounting and sex behavior is very typical, but about halfway through the behavior, Dayu turned on the light to stimulate these estrogen receptor containing neurons only in the male mouse and what she observed was incredibly dramatic. The male mouse ceases from trying to mate with the female mouse and immediately tries to kill the female mouse. He starts attacking her. Then she turns off the light, the male stops and goes back to trying to mate with the female mouse. So I'm sure all of this was very confusing and disturbing to the female mouse. Nonetheless, that was the repertoire. They would mate. She would stimulate these ventromedial hypothalamus neurons. The male mouse would immediately try and attack and kill the female mouse. And then she would stop the stimulation and he would stop trying to attack and kill the female mouse, return to the attempt, at least, to mate with the female mouse. These are such dramatic shifts in behavior triggered only by the activation of only the small set of neurons within the ventromedial hypothalamus. And for those of you that think that you can watch this sort of thing without being disturbed, I encourage you to go to YouTube. We will provide a link where you can see a video of this type of behavior. It's incredibly dramatic. The shift in behavior is almost instantaneous, occurs within seconds, if not milliseconds, thousandths of a second. The next experiment that she did was to put a male mouse with this stimulation with light capability in its ventromedial hypothalamus into a cage alone, but with a rubber glove filled with air or water. Mouse, walking around sniffing, peeing, which is what male mice seem to do. They seem to urinate everywhere, that's actually an interesting, perhaps interesting feature of male mice and actually many male animals, perhaps even humans. We don't know, or maybe we do know, basically this has been an observed time and time again in experiments, mainly by Lisa Stowers's lab at the Scripps Institute, that's characterized this. If you put female mice into an arena or a cage, they always urinate in a very small corner of that cage. Whereas if you put mail mice into an arena or a cage, the urinate everywhere, they have this obsession with spraying their urine everywhere, you can transpose that to human behavior if you like. In any event, Dayu put the mouse in the cage alone, but with this rubber glove, the mouse is walking around urinating, et cetera, doing whatever is that mice do, then she stimulates the activation of these ventromedial hypothalamus neurons, and the mouse immediately tries to kill the glove. It goes into a rage, attacking the glove as if it were another mouse or some other animate object. But of course it's an inanimate object. It's just a rubber glove. She stops the stimulation and the mouse immediately goes back to being completely calm or at least not attacking. Again, we don't know what the mouse was feeling. So these are very dramatic videos. Again, you can see them by following the link that we'll provide in the caption. If that sort of thing is going to disturb you, by to see, for instance, the attack, one mouse attacking another, please just don't watch them. I'm not interested in traumatizing anybody or you traumatizing yourself, that is. A number of different variations were done on this experiment. For instance, stimulating the VMH in female mice, as opposed to male mice, putting the female mice in with other female mice or with other male mice, no matter what variation one carries out, so it doesn't matter if it's male with female, male with male, female with female, et cetera, stimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamus in a male mouse or a female mouse evokes this very dramatic, almost instantaneous aggressive behavior, physically aggressive behavior. Subsequent experiments done by Dayu Lin in her own laboratory and other laboratories have shown that the ventromedial hypothalamus connected with a bunch of other brain areas that are interesting, And I'll talk about some of those in a little bit, but one of them that I want to call out now is the so-called PAG, the periaqueductal gray nucleus. This is a large structure in the back of the brain that houses things like neurons that can create opioids. We all know of the opioid crisis, but these are neurons that can produce endogenous, means made by the body, chemicals that can cause pain relief. You could understand why that might occur in a circuit for aggression, right? Even if one is the aggressor, it's likely that they may incur some physical damage and they'd want some pain relief. The PAG also is connected to a number of neural circuits that eventually, through several processing stations, excuse me, arrive at things like the jaws. And in fact, stimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamus can evoke biting and aggressive biting behavior. Now aggressive biting behavior is particularly interesting because in humans and especially in human children, biting is something that, while young children might do as a form of aggression, tends to disappear pretty early in childhood. And if it doesn't, it's often seen as a mark of pathology. I have a story about this, actually, when I was a kid, I went to a summer sports camp and I'll never forget this, so we're playing soccer and in a rare stroke of luck or accident, I happened to score a goal. I wasn't a particularly good soccer player, especially not at that stage of my life. They later figured out that it was just better to make me a fullback, 'cause I could just wait there and do what fullbacks do. I was better at taking the ball or the person out than I was putting the ball in the goal. Nonetheless, I, again, by chance, scored a goal and I was trotting back to my side of the field, and all of a sudden I felt this sting in my back, a kid, not to be named, although I do remember your name, I'm not going to tell you what his name was. A kid jumped on my back and bit me on the top of my back. And this of course resulted in a discussion and a timeout and all the usual things and parents I think got involved. I don't recall, I didn't think much else of it, but I recall that this was considered especially troubling behavior because he bit me as opposed to hit me or shoved me down or something that sort, and it does seem as if the tendency to use biting as an aggressive behavior is associated with a more primitive circuitry. Now here I'm truly anthropomorphizing. I don't know what this other kid happened to be thinking or feeling at the time, how could I? And I certainly am not going to say that biting in every case reflects a pathology, although I think there is general agreement in the psychology community, in the psychiatric community that past a certain age, the using of one's teeth to impart aggression and damage on others is a particularly primitive and troubling or at least for the observer or the person experiencing is a pretty disturbing event. Dayu's lab has shown that activation of the ventromedial hypothalamus triggers a downstream circuit in the periaqueductal gray which then triggers a whole other set of circuits of fixed action patterns. Here we are back to Lorenz with fixed action patterns, including swinging of the limbs, right punching. And this wouldn't necessarily be controlled punching, but also biting behavior. So it's remarkable to me, at least that we have circuits in our brain that can evoke violent use of things like our mouth or violent use of things like our limbs. That of course could be used for things like singing or kissing or eating or, you know, gesticulating in any kind of polite or impolite way. The point here is that neural circuits, not individual brain areas evoke the constellation of behaviors that we call aggression. Now, many of you are probably puzzled or at least should be because I've been talking about this highly specialized brain area, the ventromedial hypothalamus and this highly specialized subcategory of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus, these neurons that make estrogen receptors. And yet the activation of those cells triggers dramatic and immediate aggression, both in males and in females and both against males and against females. So what's going on here? Most of us think about estrogen and we don't immediately think of aggression. Most of us hear testosterone and we might think about aggression, although other things as well. In order to understand this, I just want to briefly refer back to a conversation that I had on a previous episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast. And that was with my colleague, the great Robert Sapolsky of course, is a professor at Stanford who studied testosterone and its impacts on behavior as well as estrogen and other hormones and their impacts on behavior. To make a long story short and to dispel a still unfortunately very common myth. Testosterone does not increase aggressiveness, testosterone increases proactivity and the willingness to lean into effort in competitive scenarios. Sometimes this is referred to as the challenge hypothesis, but to make a long story short, if people are given testosterone, or if you look at people who have different levels, excuse me, of testosterone, endogenously that they naturally make. What you'll find is that testosterone tends to increase competitiveness, but not just in aggressive scenarios. So if somebody is already aggressive, giving them testosterone will have the tendency to make them more aggressive. If somebody however is very benevolent and altruistic, giving them testosterone will make them more benevolent and altruistic, at least up to a point. Now, of course there are certain forms of synthetic testosterones that are known in sports circles and in other circles to increase aggressiveness because of the way those particular forms of synthetic testosterones work. But in general, most of the experiments that I'm referring to have not been done using those, they've been done using the let's call them the more traditional biological forms of testosterone or that resemble the biological forms of testosterone. In fact, Robert Sapolsky described a really interesting experiment in which, if you look at testosterone levels or you administer additional testosterone to people who are doing philanthropy, giving money to organizations and so they're essentially doing good because these are organizations doing good. What you find is that increased testosterone or further increasing testosterone makes people more willing to compete, to give more money than the other person in the room in order, you know, to put it in air quotes, \\\"To Alpha out the other person,\\\" by giving more money. So this is an act of altruistic or benevolent philanthropy. It is not an act of aggression. Of course, we don't know what the people are feeling underneath all that. Again, we can't anthropomorphize or project onto other people what they're feeling. But the point is that testosterone itself does not make people more aggressive. And in the experiments that we've been talking about up until now, it's actually the activation of estrogen receptor containing neurons that makes these animals more aggressive. And it turns out there's evidence that in certain context, estrogen can make people more aggressive. So what's going on here? Well, what's going on is that testosterone can be converted into estrogen through a process called aromatization. There's an enzyme called aromatase. Anytime you have word that ends in A-S-E, at least if it's in the context of biology, it's almost always not always, but almost always an enzyme. So the aromatase enzyme converts testosterone into estrogen, and it is actually testosterone, aromatized, converted into estrogen and then binding to these estrogen containing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus that triggers aggression. I want to repeat that, it is not testosterone itself, that triggers aggression. It is testosterone aromatized into estrogen within the brain and binding to these estrogen receptor containing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus that evokes aggression and dramatic aggression at that. Now this effect of estrogen causing aggression in the brain is very robust, so much so that if you take a mouse that lacks the aromatase enzyme or a human that lacks the aromatase enzyme, and they do exist, then there is a reduction in overall aggression, despite high levels of testosterone. And if people who or mice who have the aromatase enzyme have that enzyme blocked, well, then it doesn't matter how much you increase testosterone or any of its other derivatives. You do not observe this aggression. So this runs counter to everything that we know and think about the role of testosterone. Again, testosterone increases competitiveness. It can increase the desire to work under challenge. I've said it before, and I ran this or pressure tested this against Robert Sapolsky who's been working on testosterone and it's role in the brain and behavior for many decades now. It is fair to say that testosterone has the net effect of making effort feel good, or at least increasing the threshold at which effort feels bad or unsustainable. And it does that by way of changing the activity or the threshold for activation of brain structures, like the amygdala and other brain structures associated with anxiety. So the next time somebody says, testosterone makes people aggressive. You can say, \\\"Ah, no, actually it's estrogen that makes people aggressive, and animals aggressive for that matter. Now of course it is the case that because males have relatively less estrogen circulating in their brain and body than females, right? Because they have testes, not ovaries, that testosterone is required in the first place in order to be converted into estrogen, to activate this aggressive circuit involving these estrogen receptor containing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus. But nonetheless, it is estrogen that is the final step. It is the hormone on which aggression hinges. And I think for most people, that's a quite surprising finding. And yet this is perhaps one of the more robust findings in both the animal and human literature, as it relates to hormones and psychological states and behavior. Now, of course it is the case that if testosterone is low, that a person or an animal will exhibit less aggressive behavior, but that's not because of reduced testosterone per se. It's because of the subsequent reduction in testosterone, meaning if there's no testosterone to aromatize into estrogen, estrogen will also be lower. So we've established that it's not testosterone, but testosterone converted into estrogen that activates these circuits for aggression. But nonetheless, it's still surprising, right? I mean, most of us don't think about estrogen as the hormone that stimulates aggression, but it turns out it's all contextual. There are beautiful data showing that whether or not estrogen stimulates aggression, can be powerfully modulated by whether or not days are short or days are long. In other words, whether or not here's a lot of sunshine or not. Now, obviously brain is encased in skull. So it doesn't really know if there's a lot of sunshine out there even though you can see the sun with your eyes, you can feel it on your skin. Day length is converted into hormonal signals and chemical signals and the primary hormonal and chemical signals involve melatonin and dopamine and also the stress hormones. So to make a very long story short, in the long days where we get a lot of sunlight, both in our eyes and on our skin, melatonin levels are reduced. Melatonin is a hormone that tends to produce states of sleepiness and quiescence. It also tends to activate pathways that tend to reduce things like breeding and sexual behavior. In long days, dopamine is increased. Dopamine is a molecule associated with feelings of wellbeing and motivation and the desire to seek out all sorts of things, all sorts of motivated behaviors. And in long days provided we're getting enough sunlight on our skin and to our eyes, the stress hormones, especially cortisol, and some of the other stress hormones are reduced in levels. If estrogen levels are increased experimentally under long day conditions, it does not evoke aggression. However, in short days, if estrogen is increased, there's a heightened predisposition for aggression. And that makes perfect sense. If you think about what short days do to the biology of your brain and body. In short days, the melatonin signal goes up. There's more melatonin circulating for more of each 24 hour cycle. Stress hormones are circulating more. Why? Short days tend to be associated with winter. In winter, we are bombarded with more bacterial viruses because bacterial viruses actually survive better in cold than they do in heat. In fact, in my laboratory, we work with a lot of viruses and bacteria and when we want to keep them alive, we put them in the freezer. If we want to kill them, if we want to inoculate them, we put them under UV light. Like you would see from the sunlight. So shorter days are conducive to aggression. Not because days are short per se, but because stress hormone levels are higher and because dopamine levels are lower. Now, here's where all of this starts to converge on a very clear biological picture, a very clear psychological picture, and indeed a very clear set of tools that we can think about and use. Under conditions where cortisol is high, where this stress hormone is elevated and under conditions where the neuromodulator serotonin is reduced there is a greater propensity for estrogen to trigger aggression. Now, again, I know I've said it before, but for males who make a lot of testosterone relative to estrogen, you have to swap in your mind this idea that if testosterone is high, that means that estrogen is low because while that can be true in the periphery in the body, if testosterone is high, there is going to be some aromatization, that conversion of testosterone to estrogen. So anytime you hear that testosterone is high, you should think testosterone is high in the body and perhaps estrogen is low in the body. But that means that there's going to be heightened levels of estrogen in the brain and therefore increased propensity for aggression. In females who generally make less testosterone relative to estrogen, there is sufficient estrogen already present to trigger aggression. So both males and females are primed for aggression, but that's riding on a context and that context of whether or not you get a tendency for aggression or not. depends on whether or not cortisol is high or low, and I'm telling you that if cortisol is relatively higher in any individual, there's going to be a tilt, an increase in that hydraulic pressure that Lorenz talked about toward aggression. And if serotonin, the neuromodulator that is associated with feelings of wellbeing and sometimes even of slight passivity, but certainly of wellbeing, if serotonin is low, there's also going to be a further shift towards an aggressive tendency. So if we return to Lorenz's hydraulic pressure model of aggression in other internal states, we realize that external stimuli, things that we hear, things that we see, for instance, someone saying something upsetting or us, seeing somebody do something that we don't like to others or to us, as well as our internal state, our subjective feelings of wellbeing, but also our stress level, our feelings of whether or not we have enough resources and are content with what we have. All of that is converging on this thing that we call internal state and creating this pressure of either to be more aggressive or less aggressive. And now we have some major players feeding into that final pathway. That question of whether or not will we hit the other, person, will we say the thing that is considered aggressive? Will we not say it? If somebody says something or does something aggressive to us, will we respond or will we be submissive or even passive? Again, there are many things funneling into that question and dictating whether or not the answer is, \\\"Absolutely I'll fight back,\\\" or, \\\"I'm going to attack them even unprovoked.\\\" Or if they say this, I'm going to do that, or no matter what they do, I'm not going to respond. These kinds of things are very complex. And yet we really can boil them down to just a few common elements. And I'm telling you that those elements are whether or not cortisol levels are relatively lower or relatively higher. Again, relatively higher is going to tend to make people more reactive. Why? Because reactivity is really a function of the autonomic nervous system, which is sort of like a seesaw that oscillates between the so-called sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system, which tends to put us into a state of readiness through the release of adrenaline. Cortisol and adrenaline when they're circulating the brain and body, make us more likely to move and to react and to speak. It's actually what will induce a kind of low level tremor, which is an anticipatory tremor to be able to move more quickly, right? A body in motion is more easily set into further motion, that is, and the neuromodulator serotonin is a neuromodulator that in general is associated with feelings of wellbeing in response to what we already have. So when we are well fed, serotonin tends to be released in our brain and body, in particular, well fed with carbohydrates, the precursor to serotonin is tryptophan. And indeed there are nice studies exploring the types of diets, nutritional programs that can reduce aggressive behavior, both in children and in adults and tryptophan-rich diets or supplementation with tryptophan. So for tryptophan rich diets, things like white turkey meat, but then there are also a number of carbohydrates you can look up. It's very easy to find foods that contain lots of tryptophan. Those foods contain the precursor to serotonin. Now it isn't simply the case that eating more foods with tryptophan will tend to reduce your aggression. I suppose it could do that, if you ate it in abundance, it could make you tired and then you're less likely to be aggressive, I don't recommend that strategy, but the idea here is that when it's been explored, increasing levels of tryptophan either by supplementation or by food or drugs, prescription drugs that increase serotonin. So for instance, fluoxetine sometimes called Prozac or Zoloft or any number of the other SSRIs tend to reduce aggressive behavior. Now, not always, but in general, that's the case. Similarly, because elevated cortisol tends to shift the whole system, again, create more of a hydraulic pressure towards aggressive states. If cortisol levels are reduced, well then the tendency for aggressive behavior is reduced. This is supported by a number of peer reviewed studies. We'll provide links to some of those in the caption show notes. And we're going to return to these a bit later in the context of specific studies that have looked at genetic variants in different individuals that cause them to make more or less serotonin, or at least to metabolize serotonin differently. This is also the case for so-called intermittent explosive disorder that can often be associated with gene variants that control how much serotonin is made or how it's metabolized or how much cortisol is made and how much it's metabolized. In thinking about tools that are a number of things that one could consider. First of all, there are a number of decent studies exploring how supplementation with the Omega-3 fatty acids, which are precursors of some of the transmitter systems, including serotonin that can modulate not directly mediate, but modulate mood and emotional tone supplementation with the omega 3 S has been shown to reduce impulsivity and aggressiveness in certain contexts in things like ADHD or in individuals who have a predisposition for aggressive type behavior or aggressive thinking. Now that doesn't necessarily mean that the omega 3 fatty acids are going directly to the ventromedial hypothalamus and changing the activity of neurons there more likely they are causing or modulating an overall shift in mood through the immune system, through hormone systems that are changing the overall tone or the propensity for neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus to be activated. How much omega 3 fatty acid, what source? Well, we've talked about this on the podcast before. You can, of course get omega 3 fatty acids from a number of different foods. Getting them from whole foods is probably the best way to do it, but many people, including people with depression will often supplement with one gram or more of omega 3 fatty acid per day. Some people including myself will take them every day as just a general mood enhancer. I don't suffer from depression, but I've found it be beneficial for my health. And so some people do that, and I've talked about before, how in double blind placebo controlled studies, people taking one to three grams of omega 3 fatty acids per day, typically in the form of a high quality fish oil, although there are other sources as well, algae and so forth, can experience improvements in mood that are on par with some of the SSRIs, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. And of course, if you're prescribed an SSRI by your psychiatrist or other doctor, please do take that and don't cease to take it just simply to take omega 3s. However you might mention to them, and you can find links to the studies in our previous episodes on depression that supplementation with omega 3 fatty acids of at this one gram or more of EPA specifically, so getting above that one gram threshold, as high as three grams per day of the EPA has allowed people to take lower doses of SSRIs and still keep their mood in a place that's beneficial for them. And in terms of keeping cortisol in a range that's healthy and doesn't bias someone toward high levels of aggression and irritability, that's again, going to be set by a number of larger modulators or contextual cues. And I've talked about some of those on the podcast, but I'll just briefly recap them now, obviously getting sunlight in your eyes early in the day, and as much sunlight as you safely can in your eyes throughout the day is going to be important. Again, because of this effect of estrogen in long days, not increasing aggression, however, in shorter days, estrogen increases aggression because of the increase in cortisol observed in short days. Another way to reduce cortisol was discussed in our episode on heat and the use of sauna and heat, but also hot baths. It turns out that hot baths and sauna can be very beneficial for reducing cortisol. All the details on that are included in the episode on heat and it's timestamped, so you can go directly to that if you want to learn about the temperatures and the various durations, but to just give a synopsis of that, a 20 minute sauna at anywhere from 80 to a hundred degrees Celsius is going to be beneficial for reducing cortisol. If you don't have access to a sauna, you could do a hot bath, adjust the temperature so you don't burn yourself. I think 80 to a hundred degrees Celsius is going to be too hot for many people if it's a hot bath, whereas many people who can't tolerate that hot bath can tolerate the sauna. So safety first always, and of course, but hot baths reduce cortisol, hot saunas, reduce cortisol of a duration about 20 or 30 minutes is going to be beneficial. And of course, some of you may be interested in exploring the supplementation route and for reductions in cortisol, really the chief player there is ashwagandha, which is known to decrease cortisol, fairly potently. I should just warn you that if you're going to use ashwagandha in order to reduce cortisol, first of all, check with your doctor or healthcare provider before adding or subtracting anything from your supplementation or health regimen. Of course, I don't just say that to protect us. I say that to protect you, you are responsible for your health, what you take and what you don't take. Chronic supplementation with ashwagandha can have some not so great effects of disruption of other hormone pathways and neurotransmitter pathways. So the limit seems to be about two weeks of regular use before you'd want to take a break of about two weeks. So ashwagandha again, a very potent inhibitor of cortisol, but with some other effects as well, don't use it chronically for longer than two weeks. But if your goal is to reduce cortisol, let's say you're going through a period of increased irritability and aggressive tendency, maybe you're also not getting as much light as you would like, and perhaps also, if there are other circumstantial things leading you towards more aggressiveness and your goal is to reduce aggressiveness, that can be potentially helpful. And in light of all this stuff about cortisol and estrogen and day length, I should mention that there are in fact, some people who have a genetic predisposition to be more irritable and aggressive, and there are a couple of different gene pathways associated with this. We never like to think about just one gene causing a specific behavior. The way to think about genes is that genes generally code for things within our biology. In the context of today's discussion, things like neural circuits or the amounts of neurotransmitters that are made, or the amounts of hormones that are made, or the amount of neurotransmitter hormone receptors or enzymes, et cetera, that shift the activity of our biology in a particular direction. They bias our biology. And in fact, there is a genetic variant present in certain people that adjusts their estrogen receptor sensitivity, and that estrogen receptor sensitivity can result in increased levels of aggression, sometimes dramatic increases, however, and also very interestingly, photo period, meaning day length, is a strong modulator of whether or not that aggressiveness turns up or not. Whether or not that person with the particular gene variant is more aggressive or not, depends on how long the day is and how long the night is. One particular study that I like that references this is Trainer, et al, the title of the study is \\\"Photo period reverses the effects of estrogens on male aggression, via genomic and non-genomic pathways.\\\" This was a paper published in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. We'll put a reference to this in the show notes, if you'd like to explore it further, but it really points to the fact that rarely, sometimes, but rarely, is it the case that just one gene will cause somebody to be hyper aggressive. Almost always there's going to be an interplay between genetics and environment and as environment changes such as day length changes and the length of night changes, so too, will the tendency for people with a given genetic variant to be more aggressive or not. Now, of course, in the absence of detailed genetic testing for this particular estrogen receptor variant, most people, I'm guessing you, are probably not walking around knowing that you have this gene or not. Regardless, I think it's important to pay attention to how you feel at different times of year, depending on whether or not summer, whether or not it's winter, whether or not you're getting sufficient sunlight, meaning viewing sufficient sunlight or not, whether or not you're getting sufficient sunlight exposure to your skin or not, whether or not you're indoors all the time. Generally those things correlate with season, but not always. You can go through long bouts of hard work in the summer months when days are long, but you're indoors a lot and getting a lot of fluorescent light exposure late in the evening. And perhaps that's when you're feeling more aggressive. So we have to be careful about drawing a one-to-one relationship between any biological feature and certainly psychological or behavioral feature like aggressiveness, but it's, I believe, helpful to know that these genetic biases exist, how they play out again, they shift our biology in a general thematic direction. They don't change one thing. They change a variety of things that bias us toward or away from certain psychological and behavioral outcomes and the various things that we can do in order to offset them. And we described those earlier in terms of trying to keep cortisol low by getting sufficient sunlight regardless of time of year, and regardless of whether or not you happen to have this particular genetic variant. So earlier I talked about how it is testosterone converted into estrogen that's activating aggression in the ventromedial hypothalamus, not testosterone itself. However, there are some studies carried out in humans that have evaluated the effects of testosterone and how levels of testosterone correlate with aggressiveness in the short term. I'm just going to detail a few of those studies because I think they are interesting and important. First of all, there is a study that has explored levels of testosterone in men of different professions. Now, before I tell you the data, I want to be very clear here, with a study such as this, one never knows whether or not these men went into a particular profession because they had a testosterone level of a given value or whether or not the work itself altered their testosterone levels or both. And I think it's fair to assume that it's probably both. So be very careful in assuming that a given testosterone level is causal for choosing a particular career or that a particular career is causal for creating a particular testosterone level. This study used salivary testosterone levels as the measure, which to be fair is not the best way to measure testosterone. Typically blood draw would be the best way to measure testosterone, but nonetheless, provided the appropriate methods are used, salivary testosterone can be a reasonable measure of testosterone. The different occupations that were looked at were, and here they just looked at men in this particular study were ministers, salesmen, they didn't say what particular types of salesmen, firemen, professors, of all things, physicians and NFL players. And what they discovered was that the testosterone levels were essentially in that order from low to highest. So minister, salesman, fireman, professor, physician, NFL player. Now we could micro dissect all the different stereotypes and all the different features of each of these jobs. For instance, we don't know whether or not the fact that the firemen happened, at least in this study to have lower testosterone levels on average than the professors or the physicians was because firemen have lower testosterone levels or because they have a much more stressful job and their cortisol levels are higher than the professor or the physician and cortisol and testosterone, not always, but generally are in somewhat antagonistic push-pull mode because they derive from the same precursor, et cetera. Typically, when cortisol is high, testosterone tends to be lower and vice versa. So we don't know what's causing these effects. And again, this is just one study and just six occupations, but I think it's relatively interesting given the fact that each of these professions involves different levels of competitiveness, right? So we don't necessarily just want to think about the level of physical exertion that's required, but also the level of competitiveness because it's known that competitive interactions can cause increases in testosterone, in particular, in the winners of competitive interactions, a topic for a future podcast. Meanwhile, studies that have analyzed also again, salivary testosterone in prisoners, in this case, female prisoners, so these are incarcerated individuals, have looked at levels of testosterone according to whether or not the person committed a non-violent or a violent crime in order to arrive in prison. And higher levels of salivary testosterone were related to those that had arrived in prison because of conviction of a violent crime, as opposed to a nonviolent crime. Likewise, when they analyzed prison rule violations, so an indirect measure of aggressiveness, but in this case, it was strongly associated with aggressiveness because they knew what the violations were, they found were for prisoners that had none, no prison violations, prison rule violations I should say, their testosterone levels tended to be lower than the testosterone levels of women that had some, even one, or more aggressive violations of prison rules. We'll provide links to these studies in the show notes if you'd like to go into them further, obviously studies like this need to be taken with a grain of salt because there are so many different factors, different prisons have different degrees of violence to begin with and competitiveness to begin with. But just as a final pass at examining the role between testosterone and aggressiveness, there was a very interesting study from Goetz, et al, G-O-E-T-Z published in 2014, that looked at serum, so in this case, blood levels of testosterone. 30 minutes after application of a gel-based testosterone that goes transdermal so that the testosterone can go very quickly into the bloodstream, and then did brain imaging to evaluate the activity of neurons in the so-called corticomedial amygdala, the cortico, the medial amygdala is one of the areas of the amygdala complex as we call it because it's complex, it's got a lot of different nuclei, you know, know what nuclei are, low clusters of neurons. It's got a lot of different ones, but that medial and that cortico medial amygdala in particular, is known to be associated with aggressive type behaviors. It's linked up with as part of the larger circuit that includes the ventromedial hypothalamus and other brain areas that we referred to earlier, such as the PAG. What is remarkable about this study is that it showed that just 30 minutes after application of this so-called AndroGel, this testosterone that seeps into the bloodstream, there was a significant increase in of course, testosterone and corticomedial amygdala activation. So testosterone can have acute effects, immediate effects on the pathways related to aggression. And I think this is something that's not often discussed because many of the effects of steroid hormones like testosterone, and estrogen are very slow acting. In fact, steroid hormones, because they have a certain biochemical composition can actually pass through the membranes of cells, so the outside of a cell and into the nucleus of the cell and change gene expression in the cell, you think about puberty, the kid that goes home for the summer and then comes back looking completely different. Well that's because of a lot of genes got turned on by steroid hormones like testosterone and estrogen, but the steroid hormones can also have very fast acting effects and with testosterone in particular, those can be remarkably fast acting and one of the most apparent and well documented fast acting effects is this effect: the ability to activate cells within the amygdala, so you might say, \\\"Well, I thought the amygdala was associated with fear?\\\" Wouldn't testosterone then cause fear? No. Turns out that the amygdala harbors, both cortisol, corticosteroid receptors and testosterone receptors, and they each adjust the activity in the amygdala differently, such that testosterone tends to activate amygdala circuitry for inducing states of mind and body that are more action based and indeed in animals and in humans, testosterone application and activation of this corticomedial amygdala pathway will make animals and humans lean into effort. This is why I say testosterone makes effort feel good, or at least biases the organism toward leaning into challenge. So if you recall, there's not just one type of aggression, there's reactive aggression, which is triggered when one is confronted with something that sometimes is inevitable, right? One needs to fight for their life or for somebody else's life, but also proactive aggression and proactive aggression involves activation of those go-pathways in the basal ganglia and a leaning into effort to overcome whatever state one happens to be in to begin with. And so this is very important because it points to the fact that yes, estrogen is activating aggression pathways that are in the ventromedial hypothalamus, but it's very likely the case that testosterone is acting to accelerate or to bias states of mind and body toward those that will lead to aggression. Again, aggression is not like a switch, on and off. It's a process. It has a beginning, a middle and an end. Remember that hydraulic pressure that Conrad Lorenz hypothesized? Well, think of testosterone as increasing the pressure toward an aggressive episode and then estrogen actually triggering that aggressive episode in the ventromedial hypothalamus. So if somebody tells you that testosterone, endogenous or exogenous makes people aggressive, tell them no, testosterone tends to make people lean into effort. And if that effort involves being aggressive, either reactively aggressive or proactively aggressive, well then it will indeed lead to aggression. But the actual aggression itself is triggered by estrogen, not testosterone. Now, thus far, we really haven't talked too much about the social context in which aggression occurs. And that's because there is a near infinite, if not infinite number of variables that will determine that. So for instance, violent aggression is entirely appropriate at a professional boxing match provided it's occurring inside the ring and only between the competitors and within the bounds of the rules of the sport, et cetera. However, there are some things that tend to bias certain social context toward being more aggressive or less aggressive and not always physical aggression. And those generally come in two forms that many of you are familiar with, which are alcohol and caffeine. Let's discuss caffeine first. Why would caffeine increase aggressive impulsivity? Well, the general effects of caffeine are to increase autonomic arousal. The activity of the so-called sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system, which is to put it very much in plain language it's the alertness arm of your nervous system. That is, it creates a sense of readiness in your brain and body and it does so by activating the so-called sympathetic chain ganglia. Again, as I always remind people, simpa and sympathetic does not mean sympathy. Simpa means together, we're all at ones. And caffeine tends to bias our brain and body to activate the sympathetic chain ganglia, which run from about the base of your neck until the top of your pelvis and deploy a bunch of chemicals that jut out into the rest of your body, activate adrenaline release. There's a parallel increase in of adrenaline in your brain, creating the state of alertness and readiness. That state of alertness and readiness can be for all sorts of things, not just aggression. However when we are in a state of increased sympathetic tone, meaning more alert, such as after drinking caffeine, we will bias all those brain and body systems, the hormones, the chemicals, et cetera that exist, toward action as opposed to inaction. So put simply, caffeine can increase impulsivity, no surprise there. On the opposite end of things, alcohol tends to decrease activity in the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system, tends to make us feel less alert. Now, initially it can create a state of alertness because of its effects in inhibiting the forebrain, our forebrain prefrontal cortex in particular has what's called top-down inhibition. It exerts a inhibitory or a quieting effect on some of the circuits of the hypothalamus, such as the ventromedial hypothalamus. The way to conceptualize this is that your forebrain is able to rationalize and think clearly and to suppress behavior and to engage the no-go pathways telling you, \\\"Don't say that mean thing.\\\" \\\"Don't do that violent thing,\\\" et cetera. Alcohol initially tends to increase our level of overall activity by reducing inhibition, not just in that forebrain circuit, but in other circuits. Tends to make us more active. We tend to talk more than we normally would, move more than we normally would, but very shortly thereafter starts acting as a sedative by way of reducing activity in the forebrain, releasing some of the deeper brain circuits that are involved in impulsivity, but also causing a somewhat sedative effect. And then of course, as alcohol levels increase even further, people eventually will pass out, blackout, et cetera. So what we've got with alcohol and caffeine is we've got two opposite ends of the spectrum, caffeine increasing arousal and readiness, and the tendency for impulsivity and alcohol also increasing impulsivity, but through a different mechanism. A really interesting study, and I should just mention that the title of the study is, \\\"Caffeinated and non-caffeinated alcohol use and indirect aggression at the impact of self-regulation.\\\" So the title is almost self-explanatory. This was a paper published in the Journal of Addictive Behavior in 2016, examining how ingestion of alcohol that's either caffeinated or non-decaffeinated alcohol drinks impacted what they call indirect aggression. And just to remind you what indirect aggression is, these are not physical acts of aggression. These are verbal acts of aggression, so embarrassing others or otherwise, somehow trying to reduce the wellbeing of others by saying certain things in particular in groups, this study examined both males and females. This was done on by way of a college campus study, subjects were 18 to 47 years old. I guess there's some older students on that campus, or maybe they use some non-students, but you know, these days you've also got some students that are in their thirties and forties. So they have a fairly broad swath of subjects included, fairly broad racial background as well, included, not at equal numbers, but at least they included a pretty broad spectrum of people with different backgrounds. They looked in particular people that ingested non-caffeinated alcohol drinks at a frequency of 9.18 drinks per week, okay. Again, there's a college campus, not that I encourage that. I'm one of these people that I don't, I've never really liked drugs or alcohol and sort fortunate in that way I can drink or not drink and tend to not drink. But so to me, 9.18, drinks per week sounds like a lot, but I know for some people that might actually be typical. And then others who are drinking at least one caffeinated alcoholic beverage per week. And those individuals end as high, I should say as 7.87 caffeinated alcohol beverages per week. So this would be energy drinks combined, typically with hard alcohol, that's fairly commonly available in bars and so forth. And some individuals drank as much as goodness, 20.36 alcoholic drinks per week, total, some that were caffeinated, some that were not caffeinated. The basic outcome of this study was that the more alcohol someone tended to consume, the more likely it was that they would engage in these indirect aggressive type behaviors. And in terms of the caffeinated alcoholic beverages, there, the effect was especially interesting. Here I'm just going to paraphrase or I'll actually read from the study, quote, \\\"With regard to caffeinated alcoholic beverage use, our findings indicated that heavier caffeinated alcohol beverage use was associated positively with indirect aggression, even after considering one's typical alcohol use and dispositional aggression.\\\" What this means is that even though alcohol can bias certain individuals to be more aggressive, and even though certain individuals already have a disposition toward being more aggressive, there was an effect that was independent, meaning above and beyond both alcohol and a predisposition, meaning if someone was consuming caffeinated alcoholic beverages, they had a particularly high likelihood of engaging in indirect aggressive behavior. Now this makes perfect sense in light of the model they propose, which is this self-regulation model, that basically self-regulation involves several things. It involves engaging in certain behaviors and suppressing other behaviors. So as described before, because alcohol tends to have a sedative suppressive effect on the autonomic nervous system, at least after the initial period, it's going to tend to reduce the likelihood that people will engage in any type of behavior. Whereas caffeine will increase autonomic arousal and increase the likelihood that someone will engage in a particular type of behavior, aggressive or otherwise. So the combination of caffeine and alcohol is really acting as a two prong system to bias people towards more impulsivity that is less self-regulation. So it's really yanking your volitional control, your ability to engage in prefrontal top down inhibition over your hypothalamus from two distinct and specific circuits. By now, you should be getting the impression that self-regulation is a key feature of whether or not somebody, maybe even you, is going to engage in aggressive speech or aggressive behavior. And we've talked about a number of tools that one can use to reduce the probability that that will happen. I suppose, if the context were appropriate, you could even take those tool recommendations and just invert them and increase the likelihood that aggressiveness would happen. But regardless, self-regulation is key. And in light of that, I want to share with you a study that's focused on kids, but that has important ramifications for adults as well. As you probably are already aware there are many kids out there that suffer from so-called attention deficit hyperactivity, disorder, ADHD. There are also many adults we are finding that are suffering from ADHD. And there's also an epidemic I would say of people that are concerned about whether or not they have ADHD. Now whether or not they have true, clinical ADHD or not, is not clear. We did an episode all about ADHD and tools for ADHD. I would encourage you to check out that episode and some of the diagnostic criteria. If you have the opportunity you can find at hubermanlab.com, as this study I'm about to share with you aptly points out, there is no objective diagnostic marker of ADHD. There's no biomarker or blood draw or blood test for ADHD, whether or not one has ADHD depends on their performance on a number of different cognitive tests and behavioral tests and self report. In any event, the study I'm about to share with you explored how a particular pattern of supplementation in kids with ADHD was able to reduce aggressive episodes and impulsivity and increased self-regulation. And the title of the study is, \\\"Efficacy of carnitine in the treatment of children with attention deficit, hyperactivity disorder.\\\" Even though they put carnitine in the title, that what they focused on was whether or not acetyl-L-carnitine supplementation could somehow adjust the behavioral tendency of these kids with ADHD and to make a long story short, indeed it did. There was a very significant effect of acetyl L-carnitine supplementation on improving some of the symptomology, excuse me, of ADHD. A few details about this study that might be relevant to you. This was a randomized double blind placebo controlled double crossover study, this was done as an outpatient study. So the kids weren't in a hospital, they were living out in the world. This again was done on younger kids. So this was six to six to 13 year old kids that were diagnosed with ADHD. They received either acetyl L-carnitine or placebo, and they did all the good practice stuff that good researchers do of making sure that the placebo and the acetyl L-carnitine had similar look and taste. It was consumed twice daily after meals. I should just mentioned that acetyl L-carnitine typically is taken in capsule form or occasionally an injectable form. Here, they they were using this as a drink, which essentially the same as capsule form, but the powders just going directly into liquid and the carnitine dosage was 100 milligrams per kilogram. So they're doing this according to the body weight of these kids with a maximum dosage of four grams per day, the quantity of the medication was supplied here. I'm reading for a period of eight weeks and every eight weeks a new quantity of medication was supplied. So basically this is a fairly long term study, exploring behavioral outcomes and psychological outcomes in week eight, 16 and 24. They also looked at blood things that you could only get through a blood draw, so things like hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, white blood cell count, et cetera, they, these are kids and even if it were adults, they were quite appropriately examining a lot of the physiological measures that one would want to carry out to make sure, first of all, that blood levels of carnitine are increasing. And indeed they confirmed that, but also that no negative effects are showing up in the physiology as well as the psychology of these kids. So, first I'll just tell you the basic outcome of the study, which was, here I'm paraphrasing, \\\"Here, given twice daily, carnitine appeared to be effective and well tolerated treatment for a group of children with ADHD.\\\" \\\"They showed significant, the abnormal behavior compared to these other boys.\\\" And now I'm moving to the table of results. They showed significant reductions in their so-called \\\"Total Problem Score.\\\" The total problem score is a well-established measure of behavioral problems in kids with ADHD. And I should say adults with ADHD, has to do with challenges in social and learning environments and how well or poorly an individual tends to perform. Reductions in intentional problems, overall reductions in delinquency, and most important for sake of today's discussion, significant reductions in aggressive behavior. Now what's especially nice about this study, I think, is that even though it's a relatively small number of subjects and certainly needs to be repeated in other studies and other laboratories, that they were able to confirm the shifts in L-carnitine within the bloodstream of these kids, that is they were able to correlate the physiology with the psychological changes, in studies like this. And frankly in all studies of human pharmacology, you have to worry about effects that show up, not just because of placebo effects, but because of so-called off target effects or related things, totally independent of the drug or the particular supplement that you happen to be looking at, to put in the words of a great neuroscientist. Unfortunately, he passed away some years ago, but he was a member of the national academy, extremely accomplished neuroscientist once turned to me and said, \\\"Never forget a drug is a substance that when injected into an animal or a human being creates a paper,\\\" meaning you can see effects of pretty much any drug or any supplement in most all conditions. However, it is in cases such as this study, where you can quite convincingly see that the particular feature of physiology that you expected to change, actually changed. And you see a psychological outcome that you can gain much greater confidence that the changes in delinquency, in this case reduced delinquency, improved attention, reduced aggressiveness and so forth was at least somehow related to the shift in blood physiology and levels of L-carnitine or acetyl L-carnitine and carnitine in the bloodstream of these children, as opposed to something else like L-carnitine going and affecting some downstream target that you have no knowledge of. Now, of course that's still entirely possible, but I think studies such as these increase our confidence that things like L-carnitine can be used perhaps in concert with things like omega 3 supplementation, diets that are biased towards increasing more tryptophan and therefore more serotonin, obviously avoiding things like alcohol and as it appears from the study I just described, reducing one's intake or not consuming any caffeinated alcoholic beverages seems like it would be a good idea if your goal is to reduce aggressiveness, to think about the hormone context and whether or not you tend to have higher testosterone, an estrogen or lower testosterone, an estrogen, maybe even think about the work environment, whether or not you are existing in a particularly competitive work environment and even day life, time of year and whether or not you're getting sufficient sunlight, whether or not you're avoiding light in the evening and so on. So studies such as this I think are useful because they point to the fact that very seldom, if ever, will there be one supplement or one nutritional change or even one behavioral change, that's going to completely shift in individual from being aggressive and impulsive, but rather that by combining different behavioral regimens, by paying attention to things like time of year and work conditions and school conditions and overall levels of stress and likely therefore levels of cortisol, et cetera, that you can use behaviors, diet, and supplementation as a way to shift that overall internal milieu from one of providing a lot of internal hydraulic pressure as it's been called throughout the episode toward aggressive impulsivity and relax some of that hydraulic pressure and reduce aggressive tendencies. So once again, and frankly, as always, we've done a deep dive into the neurobiology and the psychology of what I believe to be an important feature of our lives, in this case aggression. I want to point out that in a episode in the not too distant future, I'm going to be hosting Dr. Professor David Anderson from Caltech University, who is the world expert on the neurobiology of aggression. In fact, he is the senior author on many of the studies related to the ventromedial hypothalamus that I discussed today. Our discussion will touch on aggression, of course. So hearing today's episode will help you digest that information, but we are also going to talk about other emotional states. He is an expert, not just in aggression, but in motivated states related to sex and mating behavior, social relationships of all kinds and how those relate, not just to biology and psychology, but also certain forms of pathology, things like PTSD and the relationship for instance, between anger, fear, anxiety, and depression, and many other important topics that I know many of you, if not all of you will be interested in. In the meantime, I want to point you to his recently released and wonderful book entitled, \\\"The Nature of the Beast, How Emotions Guide Us.\\\" And again, the author is David Anderson from Caltech. This is a wonderful book. It serves as a tremendous introduction to the history of the study of these areas, the current science and discoveries being made in these areas, all made accessible to the scientist and non-scientist alike. It's a very engaging read and so much so that even though he was gracious in sending me a copy, I also purchased myself a copy to give to somebody who is a therapist, and I've purchased another copy to give to a high school kid that I mentor because he's very interested in the neuroscience of emotions. And I think we are all interested in emotions, not just fear and some of these negative states, not just aggression, but also the positive emotions of our lives. And so, \\\"The Nature of the Beast, How Emotions Guide Us,\\\" by David Anderson is a wonderful read. I can't recommend it highly enough.

During today's episode and on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discussed supplements. While supplements aren't necessary for everybody, many people derive tremendous benefit from them, for things like improving the transition time and the quality of your sleep and improving alertness and focus. And so on. Anytime you're considering taking supplements, there are several key considerations. First of all, those supplements should be of the very highest quality. And you want to make sure that what's listed on the bottle is actually what's in the bottle, which is a problem for any supplement companies out there. The Huberman Lab Podcast is pleased to announce that we are now partnered with Momentous supplements because we believe Momentous supplements to be of the very highest quality of any supplements out there. And we've been working very closely with them in order to direct them, to create supplements that are individual ingredient supplements of the particular quality and sources that we would like to see, and that relate to the science and studies covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast. If you'd like to see some of those supplements, you can go to livemomentous.com/huberman, and there you'll see some of the supplements that we've talked about on this podcast before such as magnesium threonate for augmenting sleep, things like L-tyrosine for augmenting dopamine and things like L-carnitine, which we've discussed on today's podcast. Right now, the list of supplements and the products that are there is only partial to what will soon be included in the future. So that's an ever expanding catalog of, again, what we believe to be the very highest quality supplements available to you. For those of you that are interested in behavioral, nutritional and supplementation based tools for neuroscience and other aspects of your biology, the impact, your health and performance, we have a newsletter.

I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today I have the pleasure of introducing Dr. Matthew Walker as our guest on the Huberman Lab podcast. Dr. Walker is a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. There, his laboratory studies sleep. They study why we sleep, what occurs during sleep, such as dreams and why we dream, learning during sleep, as well as the consequences of getting insufficient or poor quality sleep on waking states. Dr. Walker is also the author of the international best selling book \\\"Why We Sleep\\\". Our discussion today is an absolutely fascinating one for anyone that's interested in sleep, learning, or human performance of any kind. Dr. Walker teaches us how to get better at sleeping. He also discusses naps, whether or not we should or should not nap, whether or not we can compensate for lost sleep, and if so how to best do that. We discuss behavioral protocols and interactions with light, temperature, supplementation, food, exercise, sex, all the variables that can impact this incredible state of mind and body that we call sleep. During my scientific career, I've read many papers about sleep and attended many seminars about sleep yet my discussion with Dr. Walker today revealed to me more about sleep, sleep science and how to get better at sleeping than all of those papers and seminars combined. I'm also delighted to share that Dr. Walker has started a podcast. That podcast entitled \\\"The Matt Walker Podcast\\\", releases its first episode this month and is going to teach all about sleep, and how to get better at sleeping. So be sure to check out the Matt Walker podcast on Apple, Spotify or wherever you listen to podcasts. Before we begin, I'd like to mention that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost of consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is ROKA. ROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses that are of the absolutely highest quality. The company was founded by two all American swimmers from Stanford and everything about the design of their glasses is with performance in mind. I've spent my career studying the visual system and how it works and I can tell you that ROKA glasses take into account the science of the visual system such that whether or not you're wearing them on a very bright day, or you walk into a shadowed area or there's cloud cover, you can still see everything with perfect clarity. That also reflects the fact that the lenses that they use are of the absolute highest optical quality. The other terrific thing about ROKA sunglasses and eyeglasses is that they're designed to be worn in all conditions. You can use them while running, while cycling, even if you get sweaty, they won't slip off. And they look great. One problem I have with a lot of so called performance eyeglasses and sunglasses out there is that they look crazy. They make people look like cyborgs. ROKA glasses have a terrific aesthetic, you can wear them to dinner, you can wear them at work, and you can wear them in all sorts of sports activities. If you'd like to try ROKA glasses, you can go to ROKA, that's roka.com and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your first order. That's ROKA roka.com and enter the code Huberman at checkout. Today's podcast is also brought to us by InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and then reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. And nowadays, with the advent of DNA tests, you can also get insight into your immediate and long term health by way of understanding your DNA. One issue with many DNA and blood tests, however, is that you get the numbers back about metabolic factors, hormones, genes, et cetera, but there's no directive as to what to do with that information. With InsideTracker, they have a very easy to use dashboard, and that dashboard not only gives you your numbers, but it gives you simple directives related to nutrition, supplementation, exercise and other lifestyle factors that allow you to move those numbers into the ranges that are right for you and your health goals. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can go to insidetracker.com/Huberman and if you do that, you'll get 25% off any of InsideTracker's plans, just use the code Huberman at checkout. Today's episode is also brought to us by Belcampo, Belcampo is a regenerative farm in Northern California that raises organic grass fed and finished certified humane meats. I don't eat a lot of meat, I eat meat about once a day, but when I do, I make sure that it's high quality and both humanely and sustainably raised. Conventionally raised animals are confined to feedlots and eat a diet of inflammatory grains, but Belcampo's animals graze on open pastures and seasonal grasses, resulting in meat that's higher in nutrients and healthy fats. Now, I've talked many times before on this podcast about how getting sufficient levels of omega threes is very important for metabolic health, hormone health, mood, essentially all aspects of one's health. Belcampo meats have high levels of omega threes, because of the grasses they feed on. The way Belcampo raises its animals isn't just better for our health, it also has a positive impact on the environment. They practice regenerative agriculture, which means that their meat is climate positive and carbon negative, meaning it's good for you, and it's good for the environment. You can order Belcampo's sustainably raised meats to be delivered to you using my code Huberman by going to belcampo.com/Huberman and if you do that, you'll get 20% off your first order. I'm a big fan of their keto meatballs I also really liked their boneless rib eyes, I eat those pretty much once a day. Again, that's Huberman for the code. And it's belcampo.com/huberman for 20% off your order. And now my discussion with Dr. Matt Walker. Great to finally meet you in person. - Wonderful to connect. I mean, it's been too long, but I suspect it would have been a shorter time before we'd met lest the pandemic, thank you for coming up. - No, thank you, yeah, I'm delighted that we're finally sitting down face to face. I've been tracking your work both in the internet sphere, and I read your book and loved it. And also from the perspective of science, you actually came to Stanford couple of years ago and gave a lecture for BrainMind. - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - And there, of course, you talked about sleep and its utility and its challenges and how to conquer it, so to speak. Let's start off very basic, what is sleep? - Sleep is probably the single most effective thing you can do to reset your brain and body health. So that's a functional answer in terms of, you know, what is sleep in terms of its benefits. Sleep as a process though, is an incredibly complex physiological ballet. And if you were to recognize or see what happens to your brain and your body at night, during sleep, you would be blown away. And the paradox is that most of us, and I would think this too, you know, if I wasn't a sleep scientist, we go to bed, we lose consciousness for seven to nine hours, and then we sort of wake up in the morning, and we generally feel better. And in some ways that denies the physiological and biological beauty of sleep. So upstairs in your brain, when you're going through these different stages of sleep, the changes in brainwave activity are far more dramatic than those that we see when we're awake. And we can speak about deep sleep and what happens there, REM sleep is a fascinating time, which is another stage of sleep, often called dream sleep, which is rapid eye movement sleep, that stage of sleep some parts of your brain are up to 30%, more active than when you're awake. So again, it's kind of violating this idea that our mind is dormant. And our body is just simply quiescent and resting. So I would happy to just sort of double click on either one of those, and also what changes in the body as well. But it is an intense evolutionary adaptive benefit and system. That said, though, I would almost push back against an evolved system when we think about the question of sleep and what sleep is. Our assumption has always been that we evolved to sleep. And I've actually questioned that and I have no way to get in a time capsule and go back and prove this, but what if we started off sleeping, and it was from sleep, that wakefulness emerged? Why do we assume that it's the other way around? And I think there's probably some really good evidence that sleep may have been the proto state, that it was the basic fundamental living state. And when we became awake, as it were, we always had to return to sleep. You know, in some ways, at that point, sleep was the price that we paid for wakefulness. And that's another way of describing what sleep is. But again, I think it sort of denies that the active state of sleep, it's not a passive state of sleep either. And then finally, you can say what is sleep across different species? And in us human beings, and in all mammalian species and avian species as well, sleep is broadly separated into these two main types. And we've got non rapid eye movement sleep on the one hand, and then we've got rapid eye movement sleep on the other. And we can speak about how they unfold across a night and their architecture because it's not just intellectually interesting from the perspective of what sleep is, it's also practically impactful for our daily lives. And I'd love to sort of go down that route too. But you navigate, you tell me I can. - No, no, let's definitely go down that route. So you mentioned how active the brain is, during certain phases of sleep. When I was coming up in science, REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep was referred to as paradoxical sleep, is that still a good way to think about it? Paradoxical because the brain is so active, and yet we are essentially paralyzed, correct? - Yeah, it really is a paradox. And where that came from was simply the brainwave recordings, that if all I'm measuring about you, is your brainwave activity, it's very difficult for me sitting outside of the sleep laboratory room to figure out, are you awake, or are you in REM sleep? Because those two patterns of brain activity are so close to one another, you can't discriminate between them. Yet, the paradox is that when you are awake, I go in there and you're sort of sitting up, you're clearly conscious and awake. But yet, when you go into REM sleep, you are completely paralyzed. And that's one of the I think that's part of the paradox. But the paradox really just comes down to two dramatically different conscious states. Yet, brain activity is dramatically more similar than different. And the way I can figure out which of the two you are in is by measuring two other signals, the activity from your eyes and the activity from your muscles. So when we're awake, we will occasionally have these blinks, and we'll have sort of seek heads. But during REM sleep, you have these really bizarre, horizontal shuttling eye movements that occur. And that's where the name comes from rapid eye movements. - Are they always horizontal? - Mostly, they are horizontal. - That's interesting. - And that's one of the ways that we can differentiate them from other waking eye movement activity, 'cause it's not always like it can be sometimes horizontal, but can also have diagonal and also vertical in that plane. But then the muscle activity is the real dead giveaway, just before you enter REM sleep, your brainstem, which is where the dynamics of non REM and REM are essentially played out and then expressed upstairs in the cortex and downstairs in the body, when we go into REM sleep, and just a few seconds before that happens, the brainstem sends a signal all the way down the spinal cord. And it communicates with what are called the alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord which control the voluntary skeletal muscles. And it's a signal of paralysis. And when you go into dream sleep, you are locked into a physical incarceration of your own body. - Amazing. - You know, why would Mother Nature do such a thing? And it's in some ways very simple. The brain paralyzes the body so that the mind can dream safely. Because think about how quickly we would have all been popped out of the gene pool. You know, if I think I'm, you know, one of the best skydivers who can just simply fly, and I've had some times those dreams, too, you know, and I get up on my apartment window, and I leap out. - You're done. - You're done, you know. So that's one of the sort of that's part of the paradox of REM sleep, both it's brain activity similarity, despite the behavioral state being so different and this bizarre lockdown of the sort of brain of the body itself. Now, of course, the involuntary muscles thankfully aren't paralyzed. So you keep breathing, your heart keeps beating. - Is this why men have erections during REM sleep, and women have vaginal lubrication during sleep? - That's one of the reasons part of the other reason though there is because of the autonomic activity. So there is a nervous, a part of our nervous system called the autonomic nervous system, and it controls many of the automatic behaviors. And some of those are aspects of our reproductive facilities. During REM sleep, what we later discovered is that you go through these bizarre what we call autonomic storms, which sounds dramatic, but it actually is when you measure them. That you'll go through periods where your heart rate, decelerates and drops and your blood pressure goes down and then utterly randomly, your heart rate accelerates dramatically, and what we call the fight or flight branch of the autonomic nervous system or the sympathetic nervous system, badly named 'cause it's anything but sympathetic, it's very aggravating, that all of a sudden fires up and then it shuts down again. And it's not in any regular way. And it's when you get those autonomic storms, you get very activated from a physiologic perspective that you can have these erections and you have vaginal discharge et cetera. - But you're totally paralyzed? - But you are still paralyzed. There are only two voluntary muscle groups that are speared from the paralysis, bizarre. One, your extra ocular muscles, because if they were paralyzed, you wouldn't be able to have rapid eye movements. And the other that we later discovered was the inner ear muscle. And we've got no good understanding as to why those two muscles groups are speared from the paralysis. It may have something to do with cranial nerve but I don't think it's that, I think it's perhaps something more sensory related. Some people have argued that the reason the eyeballs are speared from the paralysis is because if your eyeballs are left for long periods of time, inactive, you may get things such as oxygen sort of issues in the aqueous or vitreous humor. And so the eyeballs have to keep draining. - The drainage systems of the anterior eye are made to require movement. - Exactly. - People with glaucoma have deficits in drainage through the anterior chamber, but there I'm speculating. I'm also speculating, when I ask this, I would imagine that there are states in waking that also resemble slow wave sleep, or rather that there are states that slow wave sleep also resembles waking states. You've beautifully illustrated how REM sleep can mimic some of the more active brain states that we achieve in waking. What sort of waking state that I might have experienced or experience on a daily basis might look similar to slow wave sleep, non REM sleep, if any? - It's a genius way of thinking about it turns the tables I love it. We almost never see anything like the true ultra slow waves of deep non REM sleep. So we spoke about these two stages non REM and REM. Non REM is further subdivided into four separate stages, stages, one through four, increasing in their depth of sleep. So stages three and four that's what we typically call deep non REM sleep. Stages one and two light non REM. - So maybe take me through the arc of a night just so that. So I put my head down, well, for you, what time do you normally go to sleep? - So I'm usually sort of around about 10:30pm guy. And usually I'll naturally wake up sort of a little bit before 7:00, sometimes before 6:45 or 7:00, I have an alarm set for 7:04am. - You heard it here, folks Matt Walker does use an alarm clock. - I rarely, rarely I'm usually sort of. - He doesn't recommend it, but he does use it. - Yeah, I usually. - You're human after all. - Oh, I am so human. And I've had my sleep issues and I'd love to speak about that too. But it's only just, you know, in the event that, you know, 'cause I like to keep regularity too. You've got to keep those two things in balance. And 7:04 just because, you know, why not be idiosyncratic. I don't know why we always set things on these hot numbers. So yep so when you. - So you go to sleep around 10:30, so using you as an example, because I imagine a number of people go to sleep at different times. But 10:30 is about when I go to sleep, 11 is for me. But so you go to sleep at 10:30, so for that first, let's say three hours of sleep, what does the architecture of that sleep look like as compared to the last three hours of your sleep before morning? - Yeah, so I should note that that sort of, you know, 10:30 to 7:00 that's just based on my chronotype and my preferential it's different for different people. I'm not suggesting that that's the perfect sweet spot for humanity's sleep. It's just my natural sweet spot. - But I imagine most people probably go to sleep somewhere between 10pm and midnight. - It's somewhere between 9 and midnight. - And most probably wake up between 5am and 7am or 5:30 and 7:30. - Yeah, yeah at least in if you look at sort of first world nations, that's a typical sleep profile. So when I first fall asleep, I'll go into the light stages of non REM sleep stages one and two of non REM. And then I'll start to descend down into the deeper stages of non REM sleep. So after about maybe 20 minutes, I'm starting to head down into stage three non REM and then into stage four non REM sleep. And as I'm starting to fall asleep, as I've cast off from the usually with me, murky waters of wakefulness, and I'm in the shallows of sleep stages one and two, my heart rate starts to drop a little bit. And then my brainwave pattern activity starts to slow down. Normally when I'm awake, it's going up and down, maybe 20, 30, 40, 50 times a second. As I'm going into light, non REM sleep, it will slow down to maybe 15, 20 and then really starts to slow down down to about sort of 10 or eight cycles per second, eight cycle waves per second. Then as I'm starting to move into stages three and four, non REM sleep, several remarkable things happen. All of a sudden, my heart rate really does start to drop. Oh, and I'll come back to temperature, I'm going to write temperature down 'cause I always forget these things. Now I'm solidly in the foothills of middle age. So as I'm starting to go into those deeper stages of non REM sleep, all of a sudden, hundreds of thousands of cells in my cortex all decide to fire together and then they all go silent together. And it's this remarkable physiological coordination of the likes that we just don't see at during any other brain state. - That's really interesting, other than recordings from the brains of animals and a little bit from humans, I don't think I've ever seen the entire cortex or even entire regions of cortex light up like that. - Yeah, it's stunning. It's almost like this beautiful sort of mantra chant, or this sort of, you know, it's a slow inhale and then a meditative exhale, inhale, exhale. And these waves are just enormous in their size. - And the body is capable of movement at this time, there is no paralysis. - There is no paralysis, but for the most part, muscle tone has also dropped significantly. - Interesting. - At that point. And then you will, or I will then stay there for about another 20 or 30 minutes. So now I'm maybe 60, or 70 minutes into my first sleep cycle. And then I'll start to rise back up, back up into stage two non REM sleep. And then after about 80 or so minutes, I'll pop up, and I'll have a short REM sleep period, and then back down, I go again, down into non REM, up into REM. And you do that reliably, repeatedly, and I will be doing that, and I do do that every 90 minutes. At least that's the average for most adults, it's different in different species. What changes to your question is the ratio of non REM to REM within that 90 minute cycle as you move across the night. And what I mean by this is, in the first half of the night, the majority of those 90 minute cycles are comprised of a lot of deep non REM sleep, that's when I get my stage three and four of deep non REM sleep. Once I push through to the second half of the night, now that seesaw balance changes. And instead, the majority of those 90 minute cycles are comprised either of this lighter form of non REM sleep, stage two non REM sleep, and much more and increasingly more rapid eye movement sleep. And the implication that I was sort of speaking about pragmatically is, let's say that I have to, and I usually never do early morning flights or red eyes, just because I'm a mess if that happens, I'm not suggesting other people shouldn't. - I'm suggesting people not not do that. Every time I've taken a red eye or I've done that two or three days later, I get some sort of general feeling of malaise, my brain doesn't work as well, I think red eyes should be abolished. For the pilots too I mean, and for the. - And we can speak about those, there's data. - And for the emergency room, I mean, long shifts have been shown to lead to, you know, physician induced errors that lead to a lot of fatalities. I mean, there are a lot of reasons why staying up too long, or being up at the wrong times, if you're not adapted to it is just terrible. - You have the data and all of those cases, you know, particularly physicians too there was some recent data looking at suicidality. And the rates of suicide in training physicians are, you know, far, far above the norm. And I don't suspect that, you know, the schedules are helping them I suspect that sleep is a missing part of that explanatory equation, but. - I teach medical students and they they're phenomenal, but yeah, they're under extremely challenged conditions. - We shouldn't put them under those conditions. - [Andrew] No, it's not optimizing performance, I have one. - But sorry, I was sorry. - No, no, this is important. These it's an important digression. I have one question, which is you're saying that as across the night, a greater percentage of these 90 minute cycles are going to be occupied by REM sleep as you progress through the night. I'm aware that, based on work that you've done and from your public education efforts and others that we have so called circadian forces, and we have other forces that are driving when we sleep and when we want to sleep, etcetera. Without going into the details of those, I've a simple question, the experiment is the following. Let's say, God forbid, you are prevented from going to sleep at your normal time and you stay up for the four hours or five hours that normally you would be in predominantly slow wave sleep. - If let's say you finally get to lie down at 3am a time when normally your sleep would be occupied mostly by rapid eye movement sleep, will you experience a greater percentage of rapid eye movement sleep because of these so called circadian forces, meaning that's what's appropriate for that time? Or will your system need to start at the beginning of the race that were, as I'm referring to it, that we're calling sleep? And for if that's not clear to anybody, basically, what I'm asking is, if you are forced to skip the slow wave sleep part of the night, will your system leap into rapid eye movement sleep? Or does it have to start at the beginning and get slow wave sleep first? In other words, does one sleep state drive the entry to the next sleep state? - Great question, so there is some degree of reciprocity between the sleep states I should note that when we drive one of those up, we often but not always see a change in the other. There are some pharmacologies that have shown an independence to that. And we've also played around with things like temperature, and sometimes you can, you know, nudge one and not seem to upset or perturb the other. But to your, I think, lovely point, the answer is, it's a mix, but it's mostly the latter. Meaning you will mostly go into your REM sleep phases, and be significantly deficient in your deep sleep. So just because I start my sleep cycle at 3am, rather than at 10:30pm, it doesn't mean that my brain just says, well, I've got a program, and I'm just going to run the program, and the way the program runs is that we always start with a first couple of hours of deep sleep. So we're just going to begin act number one, scene one, it doesn't do that. Now, I will get some deep sleep to begin with and part of that is just because of how sleep works. Based on how long I've been awake, longer I'm awake, there is a significantly greater pressure for deep sleep. But we actually use exactly what you just described as an experimental technique to selectively deprive people of one of those stages of sleep or the other. So we will do first half of the night deprivation, and then let you sleep the second half. So that means that you will be mostly deep sleep deprived, and you will still get mostly all of your REM sleep. And then we switch it, so you only get your first four hours, which means you will mostly get deep non REM sleep, but you will get almost no REM sleep. So in both of those groups, they've both had four hours of sleep. So the difference between them in terms of an experimental outcome is not the sleep time because they both slept for the same amount. It's the contribution of those different stages. Now, we actually have more elegant methods for sort of selectively going in there and scooping out different stages of sleep. But that's the way we used to do it old school was just using this timing difference. - And who suffers more? Those that lack the early phase, and were those that lack the later phase of the night sleep? In other words, if I have to sleep only four hours for whatever reason, am I better off getting the early part of the night's sleep or the second half of the night sleep? - Depends on what the outcome measure is. - So that gets right to the differences between slow wave sleep and REM. - Right. - I was probably misinformed. But my understanding a very crude understanding I should say before. - I very much doubt I'll contrary with someone like you. - Which is that's very nice of you. The first part of the night the slow wave sleep is restorative to the musculature to motor learning, and that the dream content tends to be less emotional. The second half of the night, being more emotional dreams and sort of the unpairing of the emotional load of our previous day and other experiences. So in other words, if I were to deprive myself, excuse me of REM, I would be hyper emotional, not maybe not as settled with the kind of experiences of my life. Whereas if I deprive myself of slow wave sleep, I would feel a more physical malaise. Is that correct? Or is that far too simple? And if it is too simple, please tell me where I'm wrong? - No, I think much of that is correct. And it's sort of that plus. So for example, during deep non REM sleep, that's where we get this. It's almost a form of natural blood pressure medication. And so when I take that away from you, the next day, we're usually going to see autonomic dysfunction, we're usually going to see abnormalities in heart rate blood pressure. We also know that during deep non REM sleep, that there is a certain control of specific hormones. For example, we know that the insulin regulation of sort of metabolism, meaning how will you look from a regulated blood sugar perspective versus dysregulated, pre diabetic look of profile. That's where deep sleep seems to matter if we selectively deprive you of that we can see. - Growth hormone. - Growth hormone is different actually. So that's a beautiful demonstration where growth hormone seems to be more REM sleep dependent. And that's why we can come on to the effects of alcohol and there's some really impressive frightening data on alcohol and it's disruption of sleep. But then we also know testosterone, peak levels of testosterone happen during REM sleep. - So the second half of the night, essentially. - Which is the second half of the night. So it really just means that the, your profile of mental and physical dysfunction will be different under both of those conditions. Which one would you prefer? I would prefer neither of them. And it really depends on what you're trying to optimize for. So it's just so complicated, sleep is just so pluripotent, you know, it's so physiologically systemic, that it's almost impossible not to undergo one of those two things, just deep sleep deprivation, or just REM sleep deprivation, and not show a profile that you would really prefer to avoid. And that's the reason from an evolutionary standpoint, that we've preserved those stages of sleep. I mean, sleep is just so idiotic, you know, from an evolutionary perspective. - Or maybe waking is idiotic. - Or waking is, you know, well, yeah. - Based on your previous idea. - Who've you been talking to? I think that comment is very specific to me. Yeah, I am normally always an idiot when working. But I think this idea that sleep, you know, is so profoundly detrimental to us, if you were to take it at face value, you know, you're not finding a mate, you're not reproducing, you're not foraging for food, you're not caring for you're young and worst of all, you're vulnerable to predation, on any one of those grounds sleep probably should have been selected against. But it wasn't sleep has fought its way through heroically every step along the evolutionary path. And therefore, every sleep stage has also survived as best we can tell. What that means is that those are non negotiable. If mother nature had found a way to even just sort of, you know, thin slice some of that sleep from us, there would have been vast, I'm sure evolutionary benefits, but looks as though she hasn't. And I'm usually in favor of her wisdom after 3.6 million years, so. - Yeah, it's incredible. I want to introduce a another Gedankenexperiment, other thought experiment. So in this arc of the night, slow wave sleep predominates early in the night, and then REM sleep. There's a scenario that many people including myself experience on a regular basis. Which is they go to sleep, sleeping just fine, three, four hours into it, they wake up. They wake up, for whatever reason, maybe there was a noise, maybe the temperature isn't right, we will certainly talk about sleep hygiene, etcetera. They get up, they go to the restroom, they might flip on the lights, they might not, they'll get back in bed hopefully they're not picking up their phone and starting to browse and wake up the brain through various mechanisms light and cognitive stimulation, etcetera. They go back to sleep, let's say after about 10, 15 minutes, they're able to fall back asleep. And then they sleep till their more typical wake time. How detrimental is that wake up episode or event in terms of longevity, learning, et cetera? I would love to sleep the entire night through every night, but most nights I don't. And yet, I feel pretty good throughout the day, some days better than others. So if you were to kind of evaluate that waking episode, and compare it to sleeping the whole night through, what are your your thoughts on that? - So I think if you're waking up sort of frequently, as you're describing, I would probably get your estate in order because my guess is within the next year, you're going to be you're going to be done for, no I'm kidding you. Absolutely kidding you. It is perfectly natural and normal, particularly as we progress with age, you know, children tend to have typically more continuous sleep. Now it's not that they aren't waking up for brief periods of time they are and in fact, we all do. When we come out the other end of our sleep cycle at the end of our REM sleep period of the 90 minute cycle, almost everybody wakes up and we make a postural movement, we turn over because we've been paralyzed for so long and the body will also like to shift it's weight or position. - Do we ever look around? Ever open our eyes and look around? - You, sometimes people will open their eyes, but usually it's only for a brief period of time and they usually never commit those awakenings to memory. Your situation and it's my situation as well, I usually now at this stage of life, I don't sleep through the night. I'll usually have a bathroom break and then I'll come back. That's perfectly normal. We tend to forget that in sleep science, we think of sleep efficiency so of the total amount of time that you're in bed, how much of that percent time is spent asleep? And we usually look to numbers that are above 85%, or more as a healthy sleep efficiency. So if you're to think about me going to bed and I spend, you know, let's say, eight and a quarter, eight and a half hours of time in bed, with a normal, healthy sleep efficiency, I still may be only sleeping a total of seven and a half hours, or seven and three quarter hours. Meaning that I'm going to be awake in total, not in one long about, but I'm going to be awake for upwards of 30 minutes, net some time. Sometimes that can be after a 10 minute, you know, dalliance after having gone to the bathroom, and I'm just gradually drifting back off again. Other times, it will just be for a couple of minutes. And most of those you don't commit. So I think we need to stop, we don't need to get too worried about, you know, periods of time awake, just because we're not sleeping throughout the night. I would love to do that, too. And I remember when that used to happen, and it still happens occasionally. - Every once in a while, it feels great when it does happen. - And it's a lovely thing. - It's a surprise right? Like oh my goodness I slept through the whole night. - It is now a surprise, yeah it is a surprise. But for the most part, I think we can be more relaxed about that where we have to be a bit more attentive, though, is if you're spending long periods of time, not being able to get back to sleep. And usually we define that by saying, if it's been 20, 25 minutes, normally, that's the time when we would really say okay, let's explore this, what's going on? Let's see what's happening. The other thing is if it's happening very frequently, so even if you're, you know, not awake for 25 minutes stretches, but you're finding yourself waking up and being consciously aware that you've woken up for maybe six, seven or eight times throughout the night and your sleep is very what we call fragmented the great science of sleep in the past five or 10 years has been yes, quantity is important, but quality is just as important. And you can't have one without the other in terms of a good beneficial next day outcome. You can't just get four hours of sleep, but brilliant quality of sleep and be unimpaired. Nor can you get eight hours of sleep, but have very poor quality of sleep and be unimpaired the next day. So that's why I just sort of want to asterisk, this idea of let's not get too worried about waking up and having some time awake, that's perfectly normal and natural. But if it's happening very frequently throughout the night, or those periods of time, or long stretches of time, upwards of 25 minutes, then let's look into it. - Well, I can assure you just helped a lot of people feel better about this waking up episode that I and many other people experience. - I hope so 'cause I think it's really important that we, you know, I think I've been desperately guilty of perhaps, you know, early on being too puritanical about, you know, sleep and I've retrospected, and I've tried to explore why this was the case, you know, it was almost sleep or else, dot, dot, dot. And at the time when I was starting to write the book, which was back in 2016, you know, sleep was still a neglected stepsister in the health conversation of today. And I could see all of the, - That has certainly changed. - And it's changing, you know, and not because it's my efforts, but because of all of my colleagues. - I would say, well, it's great that you give attribution to the other people involved. And of course, it's a big field. But I think you've done a great service by cueing people to the importance of this state, not just for avoiding troublesome outcomes, but also for optimizing their waking state. It's really, you know, I view sleep as this period that feels good, but we're not aware of how it feels when we're in it necessarily. It has tremendous benefits when you're doing it well, so to speak, and it has tremendous deficits when we're not. And I think it was an important thing for you to do to cue people to this issue. And I would say mission accomplished, that people are aware of the need for sleep. I think that knowing that waking up in the middle of the night is normal, provided it's not too frequent is great and will also help people who may have been overly concerned about that. I do want to use this as an opportunity to raise something about the so called Uberman schedule not to be confused with the Huberman schedule. Fortunately, no one has confused those yet. Some years ago, there was a discussion about the so called Uberman schedule, meaning the Superman schedule. So that's Huberman without an H, which I have nothing to do with. If you read your Nietzsche this will have a subtext. But regardless, the Uberman schedule, as I understand is one in which the person elects to sleep in 90 minute, bouts spread throughout the day and night, in an attempt to get more productivity and or reduce their overall sleep need. There was a paper published recently that explored whether or not this is good or bad for us. Maybe you just give us the take home message on that. - Yes, so these Uberman like schedules and there's lots of different forms of that, they tried to essentially pie chart the 24 hour period, into short bouts of sleep with some shorter or no, well, slightly longer periods of wakefulness, then short bouts of sleep then wakefulness. You know, you're, I sort of made it, I think a quip, it's almost like you're sleeping like a baby, you know, 'cause that's the way that babies will sleep. - In 90 minute naps. - That they will have, you know, these brief naps, then they're awake, then they're asleep then they're awake. And to the chagrin of parents across the night, it's basically the same, they're awake, they're asleep, they're awake, they're asleep. And that's more the schedule that these types of protocols have suggested. And there was a really great comprehensive review that found not only that they weren't necessarily helpful, but they were actually really quite detrimental. And on almost every performance metric, whether it be task performance, whether it be physiological outcome measures, whether it even be the quality of the sleep that they were having, when they were trying to get it, all of those were in a downward direction. And it's not surprising if you look at your the way that your physiology is programmed, if you look at the way your circadian rhythm is programmed, none of that screams to us that we should be sleeping in that way. - Well, I'm chuckling because we always hear sleep like a baby. This is how babies sleep. And I would say don't sleep like a baby, sleep like an adult be an adult, get your solid eight hours. - It's Billy Crystal's line, he was, you know, a long standing suffering insomniac, he says I sleep like a baby, I'm awake every 20 minutes. You know, and I think this is another one of those demonstrations that when you fight biology, you normally lose. And the way you know you've lost is disease, sickness and impairment. And I think if you sleep, in accordance with the natural biological edict that we've all been given, life tends to be both have a higher quality and a longer duration. - Yeah, I agree. Along those lines, as a vision scientists, I've been very excited by the work on these non image forming cells in the eye, the so called melanopsin cells that inform the brain about circadian time of day. And I'm a big proponent of people getting some sunlight, ideally sunlight, but other forms of bright light in their eyes early in the day and when they want to be awake. Essentially, during the phase of their 24 hour circadian cycle when temperature is rising, and then starting to get less light in their eyes as our temperature is going down in terms of later in the day and in the evening. Are there any adjustments to that general theme that you'd like to add? Or is in any way? - No, I think that's exactly what we recommend right now. Which is try to get at least 30 to 40 minutes of exposure to some kind of natural daylight. Now, there may be parts of the world where, you know, it's. - You're from your from a rather cloudy part of the world. - I am from Liverpool, England, and the Northwest of England is not known for its beach resorts and fine weather. I remember I sort of, I went back home for a trip when I'd first been out in California, and I thought, why is the sky so low? Just you know, constantly we joke that in the UK, we usually have nine months of bad weather and then three months of Winter. And then that's your entire year in terms of climate. But to come to your point, you're exactly right, try to get that daylight. Now it can be you know, working next to a window and you're getting that natural sunlight. But that natural sunlight is even on a cloudy day in England is usually far more potent than anything that you'll get from indoor lighting, despite you thinking sort of from a perception wise, maybe the much closer than I would think. - Yeah, I've been I'm sorry to interrupt. I've been a big proponent of there's a an app called Light Meter, which will it's a free app, I have nothing to do with it that will allow you to get a pretty decent measurement of the amount of light energy coming toward you. And if you hold it up to a cloudy morning, where you don't think it's very bright out kind of a dismal day, you'll notice that there'll be 1,000, 2,000, even you know, 5,000 Lux, Lux just being a measure of brightness, of course. And then you can point the same light meter toward an indoor light that seems very bright and very intense and it'll say 500 Lux and you realize that the intensity as we gauge it, perceptually is not really what the system is receiving. So outdoor light is key. How do you get this natural stimulation? Or I should just say light stimulation early in the day, what is your typical, what does Matt Walker do to get this light stimulation? - I am no poster child, but usually I will, if I'm working out I usually work out most days. And I shopped around and I found a gym that has huge amounts of window exposure facing to the East. This is going to sound so ridiculous you know, Matt Walker chooses a gym on the basis. - I love it - Of the solar impact so he cannot you know correct his circadian. - There are a lot of criteria for selecting gyms, this one is actually grounded in physiology, and biology and so. - And selfishness about my own sleep. - No it's great. So you get the your exercise and your light stimulation simultaneously? - That's right, yep, yeah. - And so you're stacking cues for wakefulness early in the day. - Exactly, so both exercise and daylight are wonderful cues for circadian rhythm alignment, and also circadian rhythm reset each day. And so I will use both exercise, I mean, I'm neither a strong morning type or a strong evening type. And my preference to exercise is probably sometime in the middle of the day, probably somewhere around 1pm sorry, not 1am. But I'm usually working out probably around the sort of seven, sort of 45 8am time, that's usually when I'll start my workout. And there I will start with cardio spin bike facing a window. And luckily, for the most part here in California, there's usually sunlight coming through. But it doesn't matter to me because just as you said, even when it's a cloudy day that Lux coming through of light, the intensity is splendid. So I would prefer to favor my exercise just because for efficiency too, I want to get also working on the day, I'll try to match my exercise more with my circadian light exposure than I would probably if I'm going to do I really want to crush a workout, or do I want to just, you know, make sure it's a good workout? I would prefer to work out, you know, at a different time. But I like that because of the daylight. And we can speak about exercise timing at some point, because there's a lot of discussion around that, when is the right time to exercise during sleep. And we can sort of bust some myths there too. So I think you're spot on with the suggestion, get some morning daylight, try to get that exposure, usually at least 30 to 40 minutes, there was some great work recently coming out in the occupational health domain, where they moved workers from offices that were just facing walls and you know, didn't have any exposure to natural daylight. And then they did a time period during that study where they actually were in front of a window and working. And they measured their sleep and their sleep time and their sleep efficiency increased quite dramatically. I'm forgetting the numbers now but I think the increase in total sleep time is well over 30 minutes. And the improvement in sleep efficiency was five to 10%. You know, and if you're batting an 80%, you know, sleep efficiency average, we're a bit concerned about that. But add 10% to that and now you're in you know, a great echelon of healthy sleepers. And all you did was just spend some time working in front of windows. - That's great and probably folks might want to consider spending a little less time with sunglasses provided they can do that safely, you know, driving, etcetera. You're not alone with your exercise behavior and facing East. So the one and only Tim Ferriss told me recently that his morning routine nowadays consists of jumping rope while facing East to get the sunlight stimulation of the eyes. And as Matt and I both know, it has to be of the eyes, right? These portals are the only way to convey to the rest of the brain and body about the time of day and wakefulness. Along the lines of wakefulness, I have a number of questions about caffeine. The dreaded and beloved caffeine, I love caffeine, but I like it in relatively restricted periods of time. So I'm a big fan of waking up and even though I wake up very groggy, allowing my natural wakefulness signals to take hold, meaning I wake up very slowly, but I don't drink caffeine right away. I sort of delay caffeine by a little while, usually 90 minutes to two hours. And that idea came to me on the basis of my understanding of how caffeine and the adenosine receptor interact. I have a feeling you're going to pronounce adenosine differently than I do. - No, no, I will with that, I will go with adenosine. - I've tried to go with your skeletal instead skeletal and synapse and synapse. - Schedule and schedule. - There we go. But to make it really simple for folks, how does caffeine work to make us feel more alert? And does the timing in which we ingest caffeine play an important role in whether or not it works for us or against us? So maybe we just start with how does caffeine work? Why is it that when I drink mate or coffee, which are my preferred sources of caffeine, do I feel a mental and physical lift? - Yeah so I'm going to suggest counter to what most people would think, drink coffee. - Or mate, is mate okay also? - [Matthew] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Whatever form you enjoy. - We'll come on to sort of why I suggest that but when it comes to coffee, I would say the dose and the timing makes the poison. So let's start with how caffeine works. Caffeine is in a class of drugs that we call the psychoactive stimulants. So it works through a variety of mechanisms, one is a dopamine mechanism dopamine we often think of as a reward chemical or, but dopamine is also very much an alerting neurochemical, as well. And caffeine has some role it seems to play in increasing dopamine. But its principal mode of action, we believe in terms of making me more alert and keeping me awake throughout the day is on the effects of adenosine. And to explain what adenosine is from the moment that you and I woke up this morning, this chemical adenosine has been building up in our brain. And the longer that we're awake, the more of that adenosine accumulates, - Is it mask, may I ask, is it accumulating in neurons in glia, or in the blood vessels? Where and is it also accumulating in my body? Where is this adenosine coming from? And where is it accumulating? - Yeah, so the adenosine here that we're talking about that is creating the sleep pressure is a central brain phenomenon. And it comes from the neurons themselves combusting energy. And as they're combusting energy, one of the offshoots of that is this chemical adenosine. And so as we're awake throughout the day, and our brain is metabolically very active, it's accumulating and building up this adenosine. Now, the more adenosine that we have, the sleepier that we will feel. So it really is like a sleep pressure is what we call it. Now, it's not a mechanical pressure, don't worry, your head's not going to explode, it's a chemical pressure. And it's this weight of sleepiness that we feel gradually growing as we get into the evening. - May I just interrupt you again to just ask do we know what the circuit mechanism is for that? I mean, not to go too far down the rabbit hole, but for the aficionados and for myself, we have brain mechanisms like locus coeruleus that are release things that our brain areas locus coeruleus is just being a brain area, of course that release things that proactively create wakefulness. So are those neurons shutting down as a consequence of having too much adenosine? Or are there areas of the brain that promote sleepiness that are getting activated? Because these, you can imagine both things working in parallel, one or the other would accomplish the same endpoint? - Yeah and it's both. And so there are two main receptors for adenosine the A1 receptor and the A2 receptor. And they have different modes of activating brain cells or inactivating or decreasing the likelihood of firing. And adenosine works in this beautiful, elegant way, where it will inhibit and shut down the wake promoting areas of the brain whilst also increasing and dialing up the volume on sleep activating, sleep promoting range. - Biology is so beautiful. - [Matthew] Oh it's fantastic. - There's a push pull, I mean, and we could have a larger discussion at some point about that, everything seeing dark edges seeing light edges. Our ability to smell or to sense pressure on this, everything's a push pull in Biology. - Oh it's great, yeah, yep. - So this is another example where as I am awake longer, adenosine is released in the brain. And my wakefulness areas are being actively shut down by that adenosine and my sleepiness brain areas, so to speak, are being promoted to be more active, is that correct? - That's right and it's a very progressive process. It's not like a step function, where and sometimes that happens occasionally, but it's usually because you've been sort of driving through and as we'll come on to have caffeine in the system, and then all of a sudden you just hit a wall and it just, you know engulfs you and you go from zero to the one of sleepiness within a short period of time. - What explains the fatigue after a hard conversation? The desire to go to sleep or desire to go to sleep during a hard conversation? - That's an interesting one. I think it's usually just based on personality type interactions. And for the most part. - Not that I've ever experienced that before. - No people with you don't, but with me, they. - Oh no, no, I've experienced the desired to some conversations, I'm halfway through them and I feel like I want to take a nap. - Yeah. - Right. - And I would love to look at you know, people's sleep history. We've sort of seen that time and time again, but and then it could be, you know, with folks like me, people just lose the will to live within about five minutes of speaking with me, so. - Not true, they hear that sleep is important. [cross talking] - Unrelated. - [Andrew] That's awesome. - And that's flattery, that's great. But so the way that then caffeine comes into this equation, as they're saying, it's usually a kind of a linear process. Or maybe it's probably closer to an exponential in terms of your subjective feeling of sleepiness. And we haven't really been able to measure that in humans, because normally, we it's hard to actually, you know, stick something into the brain and be, you know, sucking, siphoning off stuff every couple of minutes, as you could do in animal studies. And keep asking people every couple of minutes, how sleepy do you feel, how sleepy? And track to see if there's a linear rise in, you know, adenosine, which then creates an exponential rise in subjective sleepiness or what the dynamics are, but I'm kind of nerding out. Caffeine comes into play here, because caffeine comes into your system and it latches on to those welcome sights of adenosine the adenosine receptors. But what it doesn't do is latch on to them and activate them. Because if it was doing that, then it would, you know, in lots of ways it would dial up more sort of sleepiness. It does the opposite. The way that caffeine works is that it comes in, competes with quite sharp elbows with adenosine competitively forces them out of the way, hijacks that receptor by latching onto it, but then just essentially blocks it. It doesn't inactivate the receptor, it doesn't activate the receptor, it functionally inactivates it in the sense that it takes it out of the game for adenosine. So it's like someone you know, coming into a room, and you're just about to sit down on the chair, and caffeine comes in and just pulls out the chair. And you're like, well, now I've got nowhere to sit. And caffeine just keeps pulling out the chairs from adenosine and adenosine even though it's at the same concentration in your brain, your brain doesn't know that you've been awake for, you know, 10 hours, 16 hours at that point when you've downed a cup of coffee. Because all of that adenosine that's still there can't communicate to the brain that you've been awake for 16 hours because. - But the adenosine is still in brain circulation. - Correct. - So the real question is what happens when caffeine is dislodged from the adenosine receptor? - Unfortunate things happen. And that's what we call the caffeine crash. Which is caffeine has a half life and it's metabolized and. - Do you recall what the half life is? - Yeah, the half life is somewhere between five to six hours. And the quarter life therefore is somewhere between 10 to 12 hours. It's variable, different people have different durations of its action, but for the average adult five to six hours. That variation, we understand it's down to a liver enzyme or a set of liver enzymes of the class that we call the cytochrome P450 enzymes. And there are I think last I delved into the data, which is pretty recently, there are two gene variants that will dictate the enzymatic speed with which the liver breaks down caffeine. And that's why you can have some people who are very sensitive to caffeine and other people who say, you know, it just doesn't affect me really that much at all. - These are the people that have a double espresso after a 9pm dinner and can sleep just fine. - Well, and we'll come onto. - Well at least subjectively they think they are sleeping. - Subjectively, yeah, and we should speak about that assumptive danger too. So then the caffeine is in the system and after some time period, it will be inactive in the system. So let's say that, you know, I've been awake for 12 hours now. And it's you know, 8pm and I'm feeling a bit tired, but I want to push through and I want to keep working for another couple of hours, so I have a cup of coffee. All of a sudden I was feeling tired, but I don't feel like I've been awake for 12 hours anymore. Because with the caffeine in the system, maybe only half of that adenosine is being communicated through the receptor to my brain. 100% of the adenosine is still there, only half of it is allowed to communicate to my brain. So now I think oh I haven't been awake for 12 hours, I've just been awake for six hours, I feel great. Then after a few hours, and the caffeine is starting to come out of my system, not only am I hit with the same levels of adenosine that I had before I'd had the cup of coffee several hours ago, it's that plus, all of the adenosine that's been building up during the time that the caffeine has been in my system. - So sort of an avalanche of adenosine. - It is a tsunami wave, yeah and that's the caffeine crash. - And it's interesting because the caffeine crash at two o'clock in the afternoon when you have work to do is a terrible thing. But what about the person, maybe this person is me in my 20s, who says, I'm going to drink caffeine all day long. And then I want the crash. Because at nine or 10pm, if I stop drinking caffeine at say, 6pm, and I crash, then I crash into a slumber, a deep night of sleep. Is that sleep really as deep as I think it is? Because given the half life of caffeine that you mentioned a few moments ago, I have to imagine that having some of that caffeine circulating in my system might disrupt the depth of sleep, or somehow the architecture of sleep in a way that even if I get eight, or who knows even 10 hours of sleep, it might not be as restorative as I would like it to be. - Yeah, and that is the danger, just sort of that, you know, those people that you described who say, and I, a lot of them will speak with me too say, look, I can have two espressos with dinner and I fall asleep fine and I stay asleep. Because usually those are the two phenotypes that we typically see with too much caffeine. I just can't fall asleep as easily as I want to, or I fall asleep, but I just can't stay asleep. And caffeine can do both of those things quite potently. - How late in the day do you think is assuming somebody, translate this folks, if you go to bed earlier or later, you have to shift the hours accordingly. But given somebody who typically gets into bed around 10:00, 10:30, and falls asleep around 11:00, 11:30. When would you recommend they halt caffeine intake? And these are not strict prescriptives, but I think people do benefit from having some fairly clear guidelines of what might work for them. Would you say cut off caffeine, by what time of the day? - I would usually say take your typical bedtime and count back sort of somewhere between 10 to eight hours is probably getting a little bit close. But take back sort of 10 hours or eight hours of time, that's the time when you should really stop, you know, using caffeine is the suggestion. And the reason is because for those people who even just keep drinking up until you know, into the evening, you're right, that they can fall asleep fine, maybe they stay asleep, but the depth of their deep sleep is not as deep anymore. And so there are two consequences. The first is that for me, and it can be up to by 30%, and for me to drop your deep sleep by 30%, I'd have to age you by between 10 to 12 years, or you can just do it every night to yourself with a couple of espressos. The second is that you then wake up the next morning, and you think, well, I didn't have problems falling asleep and I didn't have problems staying asleep, but I don't feel particularly restored by my sleep. So now I'm reaching for three or four cups of coffee the next morning, rather than just two or three cups of coffee. And so goes this dependency cycle, that you then need your uppers to wake you up in the morning, And then sometimes people will use alcohol in the evening to bring them down because they're overly caffeinated and alcohol, and we can speak about that, too, also has very deleterious impacts on your sleep as well. So you're right that it's not just the quantity of your sleep, or even difficulties falling or staying asleep, it can also be deep sleep. But here again, I think, you know, I don't want to be frightening people. And I mentioned this before, I think one of the real problems that I or mistakes that I made, because I didn't you know, I'd never had much public exposure before the book. And I was so saddened by you know, the disease and the suffering that I was seeing as a consequence of a lack of sleep in our society. And the fact that it wasn't really being discussed very much. I sort of came out, you know, a little bit headstrong, more than a little bit headstrong. And I think I was, you know, perhaps too much gas pedal and too little, you know, break as it were. And I don't think that's the right way to approach a health message within the public sphere. And I've become much softer in how I think about these things. I have ideas about what the ideal world looks like for sleep. But I also realize that none of us live in this thing called the ideal world. - We certainly don't. - So, you know, I want to be really mindful of that, and I think I've done a really bad job of being sort of too forthright, particularly for people who struggle with sleep, you know, early on, when I would offer these sort of messages about sleep. I want to be, you know, I want to be theoretical when it comes to the science, I want to be faithful to the science. But I also don't want to go out and scare the living daylights out of people, particularly people who are struggling with their sleep, 'cause it's probably only going to make matters worse. So I've been beautifully schooled by learning how to be a slightly better public communicator. I'm nowhere near of the standing that you are, you are very elegant and it's very intuitive to you. I'm still with training wheels, but I'm getting a little bit better. But I just want to say that when I'm speaking about caffeine, 'cause it sounds as though I'm very sort of overt about it. But I will come back to why I say drink coffee. But I just want to make that point. - Yeah, well, I appreciate you making that point. And I'm sure our listeners will too. I still will stand behind my statement, which is that what you've done for the notion that sleep is vital for all aspects of health and for performance, mental and physical and wakefulness, the message and the packaging it was contained in and is has been clearly clearly net positive people needed to be cued to this. - Thank you. - The I'll sleep when I'm dead mentality is one that I had, it's one that other people have. People in a huge number of vital communities, not just your students, but also people that this the messaging that you provided and continue to provide has positively impacted the first responder community, the medical community, there're still steps that need to be taken the military community, and of course, the civilian community. And so I think these adjustments about yeah, caffeine is okay, just restricted to the early part of the day, if you can, most days, I mean, I think the law of averages. It's like the light viewing behavior I think it is critical to view sunlight or natural, some other form of bright light early in the day but if you miss a day, it's not that your whole system is going to dissolve into a puddle of tears. That'll happen on the second or the third day, no I'm kidding, you've got a couple of days. Biology works in averages except with respect to accident or injury. A car accident is a car accident, right? You don't get to have three of those before the brain damage occurs if the accident's severe enough. But with sleep behavior, these homeostatic type behaviors, or with food, one chocolate sundae, is it going to kill you know? No. Every night? Yeah. It's going to make you demented and kill you early. We know this. And so I think the middle ground is often a hard place to achieve. So I think you've done a phenomenal job. But I appreciate you raising these points. And I think it's clear that we all need to that we all can and should do certain things better, including being gentle with ourselves from time to time when we deviate from these ideal circumstances. Along these lines, I do want to talk about alcohol because I think caffeine and alcohol represent the the kind of two opposite ends of the spectrum. Clearly there are other stimulants. There your Adderalls and your high energy drinks that people use. But alcohol and caffeine are the most commonly consumed stimulants and sedatives, depressants as they're sometimes called. So what happens when somebody has a glass? We always hear a glass or two of wine in the evening or a cocktail after dinner or before dinner, how does that impact their sleep? And then we'll be sure to circle back in terms of what is reasonable ranges of behavior when it comes to avoiding alcohol or if it's age appropriate, et cetera, enjoying alcohol? - Yeah, so alcohol, if we're thinking about classes of drugs, they're in a class of drugs that we call the sedatives. And I think one of the first problems that people often mistake, alcohol is often used as a sleep aid for people who are struggling with sleep when things like over the counter remedies, etcetera, or herbal remedies have just not worked out for them. And alcohol, unfortunately, is anything but a sleep aid. The first reason that most people use it is to try and help them fall asleep. - So and this process of this event that we call falling asleep, I have to imagine is a process. - It is a process. - Like everything in biology, and that that process involves in some way, as we talked about push pull before turning off thinking, planning, et cetera, and turning on some sort of relaxation mechanism. I have to imagine that these two things are knobs turning in opposite directions that gives us this outcome we call falling asleep. Alcohol, it seems is helpful for some people to turn off their thoughts or their planning. Is that right? - Yes, it is. And so I think, you know, if we look at the pattern of brain activity, if I were to place you inside an MRI scanner, where we're looking at the activity of your brain and watch you drifting off, some parts of your brain will become less active. Other parts will become more active. And this is the push pull model. It's inhibition excitation. But alcohol is quite different in that regard. Alcohol is because it's a sedative, what it's really doing is trying to essentially knock out your cortex. It's sedating your cortex, and sedation is not sleep. But when we have a couple of drinks in the evening, when we have a couple of nightcaps, we mistake sedation for sleep saying, well, I always when I have a couple of whiskies or a couple of cocktails, it always helps me fall asleep faster. In truth, what's happening is that you're losing consciousness quicker, but you're not necessarily falling naturalistically asleep any quicker. So that's one of the first sort of things just to keep in mind. The second thing with alcohol is that it fragments your sleep. And we spoke about the quality of your sleep being just as important as the quantity. And alcohol through a variety of mechanisms, some of which are activation of that autonomic nervous system, that fight or flight branch of the nervous system. Alcohol will actually have you waking up many more times throughout the night. So your sleep is far less continuous. Now, some of those awakenings will be of conscious recollection the next day, you'll just remember waking up, many of them won't be. And so but yet, your sleep will be littered with these sort of punctured awakenings throughout the night. And again, when you wake up the next morning, you don't feel restored by your sleep, you know, fragmented sleep or non continuous sleep in this alcohol induced way, is usually not good quality sleep, but you feel great on the next day. The third part of alcohol in terms of an equation is that it's quite potent at blocking your REM sleep, your rapid eye movement sleep. And REM sleep is critical for a variety of cognitive functions. Some aspects of learning and memory it seems to be critical for aspects of emotional and mental health. - You've described it before as a sort of self generated therapy that occurs while we sleep. - Yeah, it's overnight therapy, you know, it's emotional first aid. - Certainly people that don't get enough sleep are very easy to derail emotionally. Not that one would want to do that to people, but we all sort of fall apart emotionally. I always think of it as almost like our skin sensitivity can be heightened. - Yes, absolutely. - When we are sleep deprived. Our emotional sensitivity is such that when we're sleep deprived, such that it takes a much finer grain of sandpaper to create that kind of friction, things bother us. - [Matthew] Threshold to trigger. - Even online comments bother us when we're sleep deprived. and never when we're well rested. - I would love to say that I never look at them, except I look at. - Well actually, here I. - [Matthew] Maybe every one of them. - Here I will editorialize because the notion of not looking at comments is unreasonable to ask of any academic, because academics we are all trained to look at our teaching evaluations. And just like with online comments to ignore 20% of them, no, I'm kidding. We look at them all in any event. So in terms of translating this to behavior, I'm not, I don't particularly enjoy alcohol, I guess I might be fortunate in that sense. But I also have never really experienced the pleasure of drinking alcohol. I sometimes like the taste of a drink, but I never like the sensation. So that's, I don't have a lot of familiarity with this, but many people do, and I understand that. So let's say somebody enjoys a glass of wine or two with dinner and they eat dinner at 7pm. Is that likely to disrupt their sleep at all? Let's just sort of, let's make this a series of gradations. - And the answer is yes. I think once they just looked at a single glass of wine in the evening with dinner, and I would be untruthful if I didn't just simply say it has an effect. And we can measure that in terms of. - Less REM sleep. - Less REM sleep and one of the fascinating studies I can't remember what dose I think they got them close to a standard illegal blood alcohol level, so maybe they were a little bit tipsy. And yes, you see all of the changes that we just described, they sort of lose consciousness more quickly, they have fragmented sleep, and they have a significant reduction in REM sleep. But what was also interesting because REM sleep, as we spoke about before, is a time when some hormonal systems are essentially recharged and refreshed growth hormone being one of them, there was well over a 50% five zero drop in their growth hormone release during alcohol laced sleep at night. - And growth hormone is so vital for metabolism and repair of tissues. - Yeah, it's not just for kids. - [Andrew] Keeping body fat low. - This is essential in adults. - It's essential, along those lines, I just want to highlight the fact that this information that you're sharing that growth hormone is released is strongly tethered to the presence of healthy amounts of REM sleep is interesting to me, because I always thought the growth hormone was released in the early part of the night. - Well, it is released across both of those, but across the different stages, but what we also know is that when you disrupt REM sleep, there are those growth hormone consequences. So it's not an exclusive system just like with testosterone, we can see changes throughout non REM sleep, but if you ask when are the peak release rates of testosterone, it's right before we go into REM sleep, and then during REM sleep. - And of course, testosterone being important, both for males and females. - For men and women, yeah. - Right, for libido and tissue repair and well being. Nobody, regardless of chromosomal, hormonal, or any other background wants to have their normal levels of testosterone reduced acutely, that's just a bad it equates to a terrible set of psychological and physical symptoms. - Yeah, and the mortality risk that's associated with low testosterone is non trivial. - Prostate cancer. - Right, exactly, you know. So coming back to just the point on REM sleep that you mentioned regarding emotional instability, and we see that that's one of the things one of the most reliable signatures of just insufficient sleep doesn't have to be sleep deprivation. What we've discovered over the past 20 years here at The Sleep Center, is that there is no major psychiatric disorder that we can find in which sleep is normal. And so I think that firstly told us there is a very intimate association between your emotional mental health and your sleep health. But when it also comes to REM sleep, I think what's fascinating is that it's not just about your emotional health, it's not just about your hormonal health we've also been seeing other aspects of you know, cognition. But then there was a report, I think it could have been about two years ago, out of Harvard, I think it was Beth Clements group. They found that, and they replicated it in two different large populations. If you look at the contribution of different sleep stages to your lifespan, REM sleep was the strongest predictor of your longevity. And it was a linear relationship. It wasn't it sort of one of these U shaped or J shaped curves that we often see with total sleep, and mortality risk, it really was linear. That the less and less REM sleep that you were getting the higher and higher your probability of death. And then they did. - Was that death due to natural causes or accident? 'Cause I can imagine if you're not getting enough REM sleep, you're more likely to drive off the freeway, step off a cliff. - I think it was all cause mortal. - You just make bad decisions about anything in love relationships, which can also be life threatening. - Yeah, I've tried to lean into that and claim that with those bad relationship situations, oh, I just didn't have enough REM sleep last night. - Blame it on the sleep. - [Matthew] My darling you know. - The REM sleep difference. - And, but she's far wiser than I thought. But, so they did this great machine learning analysis and I may get these numbers backwards. But I think for every 5% reduction in REM sleep, there was a 13% associated increased risk of mortality. And I could have, I'll have to go back and check. But to me, and in the machine learning algorithm, what they ultimately spat out was that of all of the sleep stages, REM sleep is the most predictive of your longevity of your lifespan. So we often, I hear people saying, how can I get more deep sleep? Or they sometimes say how can I get more dream sleep? And my answer is a question. Why do you want to get more of that? And they'll say, well, isn't that the good stuff? And I'll say, well, actually all stages have good sleep. - It's all the good stuff. Well, it's like the exercise question and it took decades, for people to understand that moving around for about 150, probably 180 minutes a week at doing endurance type work, zone two cardio type work, it is correlated with living longer, feeling better, less diabetes, etcetera. There's really no way around it. I mean, you can ingest Metformin until the cows come home, you can take NMN, all of which I think have their place in certain contexts I'm a big fan of the work surrounding all those protocols. - Yeah likewise. - But without getting proper amounts of movement, meaning sufficient numbers, it doesn't matter how many 12 minute exercise regimes you follow per week, you need that threshold level. And it sounds like the same is true of REM sleep and total amount of sleep. There's just you pay the piper somehow. - Yeah, the return on investment I mean, to flip the coin, the return on investment is astronomical, you know, I think of sleep it is the tide that moves, you know, that raises all of those health boats. - And the most fundamental layer of mental and physical health. Whenever people ask me, even though I'm not a physician, they'll ask me, you know, what should I take or what should I do? The first question is always, how's your sleep? - Great, I love it. - Meaning how well do you sleep every night and how long do you sleep? And I always recommend your book, I always recommend your podcast, you know, the podcasts you've been a guest on, etcetera. Who knows, maybe you'll even release your own podcast at some point soon and keep because I do think people need to hear from you more often. One thing I don't want to return to the notion of public health discourse too much. But I do want to say one issue with books in general, is that they can be revised, but it's more or less a one and done kind of thing until the next book comes out. - Yeah, yeah - One thing I like about the podcast format is that updates can be provided regularly. Corrections and updates as new data come out. And so that's a wonderful aspect to this format. And hopefully the format that you'll be embracing, I think the world needs to hear more from you more often, about sleep, and its various contours, not less. And so I do have a question about drinking alcohol. Not that we want to promote day drinking, but let's say that the one or two glasses of wine or cocktail is consumed with lunch, something that isn't traditionally done nowadays, or in a late afternoon happy hour type cocktail. And then one is going to sleep seven or eight hours later, do you think that that will improve or somehow mitigate the effects of alcohol? Or if you have a drink, are you are you basically screwed for the next 24 hours? - No, I think there's going to be a time window dependency. Now, I don't know of anyone who has essentially done what you and I would like, which is the time separation dose dependent curve, where okay, you drink at 10am, then or 11, 12 one, two, three, four, five all the way up to you know, 10pm and estimate, what is the blast radius? And is it linear? Or is it nonlinear? Is it such that only when you drink in the last four hours? Do you just hit this exponential and it's bad, bad bad? Or is there some other curve that we could imagine there will be many possibilities. But certainly what we know is that the less alcohol and the less and more specifically the metabolic byproducts, aldehydes and ketones, they're the sort of the nefarious players. - And not the ketones that people are all excited about the other ketones, [cross talking] the chemists know what we're referring to. - But this is not about ketogenesis, please don't think that. - This is not about ketogenesis, there are ketone bodies, and that are released after ingesting alcohol that are not of the positive sort that a ketogenic diet might promote. - Right, so I think in terms of that alcohol profile, we certainly know that, you know, as you're heading into the evening hours, once again, timing and dose make the poison. But I think it's also important, once again, from that public message standpoint, and thank you, I think I am leaning into the sort of the podcast consideration arena, at some point, but I don't want to be puritanical here, you know, I'm just a scientist, and I'm not here to tell anyone how to live. All I'm trying to do is empower people with some of the scientific literature regarding sleep. And then you can make whatever informed choices that you want. Now, unlike you, it turns out, I'm not a big drinker. It's just because I've never liked the taste. And I'm surprised that they haven't taken away my British passport because I don't like lager or beer. But I also want to say that life is to be lived to a certain degree, it's all about checks and balances. So, you know, if I go out and you know, I have an ice cream sundae, I'm not big on those either, but, you know, sure, I know that my you know, blood glucose is not going to be ideal for another 12 hours maybe. That's just the price you pay for having some kind of relaxed, fun life. I don't want to look back on life and think, gosh, you know, I lived until I was, you know, 111 and it was utterly miserable you know. - Right. - So, but it's all about some kind of a balance. And my job is not to tell people a prescription for life, it's just to offer some scientific information. - No, I think you're doing a terrific job of that. People are I always say we have all these neural circuits and if it's working properly, we all have a circuit that allows us to skip over information or as we wish, right, if the circuits between your brain and your thumbs are working you can slide right along you can drop to the next content however you like. I would like to ask about marijuana and CBD. This is a discussion that I think five years ago would have ventured into the realm of illegal but now in many places not all medical marijuana is approved or is legal. And certainly it's in widespread use. Certainly not recommending people do it. I have my own thoughts about marijuana CBD. I've been fortunate, I suppose that I don't particularly like marijuana or CBD. I don't even know if I've ever tried CBD. First of all, does marijuana disrupt the depth of sleep, the architecture of sleep? And if so, as with alcohol and caffeine does when you ingest it or when it's in your bloodstream does, relative to when you go to sleep, does that play an important role? So does marijuana disrupt sleep? - Yeah, it does. And there's a pretty good amount of data on so we can break sort of cannabis down into two of its key ingredients. We've got THC tetrahydrocannabinol, and we've got CBD and CBD is sort of the less psychotic what we think of as the non psychoactive components. In other words, when you take CBD, you don't get high. If you take THC, you can get high. That's the psychoactive part of the equation. - Are both considered sedatives in the technical sense? - No, they're not. Neither of them have that class right now. THC can, seems to speed up the time with which you fall asleep. But again, if you look at the electrical brainwave signature of you're falling asleep with and without that THC, it's not going to be an ideal fit. So you could argue it's non natural, but many people use THC for that fact, because they find it difficult to fall asleep. And it can speed the onset of at least non consciousness, I guess is the best way of describing it. But there are problems with THC. And they are twofold. The first is that it too, but through different mechanisms seems to block REM sleep. And that's why a lot of people when they're using will tell me look, you know, I definitely, I was dreaming. Or I don't remember, you know many of my dreams. And then when they stop using THC, let's say I was having, you know, just crazy, crazy dreams and the reason is because there is a rebound mechanism. REM sleep is very clever. And alcohol is the same way in this sense, it's the same homeostatic mechanism. Some people will tell me, look, if I have a bit of a wild Friday night with some alcohol, you know, maybe I'll sleep late into the next morning. And I'll just have these really intense dreams. So and I thought I wasn't having any REM sleep, well, the way it works is that it's during in the middle of the night, really, when alcohol blocks your REM sleep. And your brain is smart it understands how much REM sleep you should have had, how much REM sleep you have not because the alcohol has been in the system. And finally, in those early morning hours, when you're getting through to sort of, you know, [cross talking] six, seven, 8:00am all of a sudden, your brain not only goes back to having the same amount of REM it would have had, it does that plus it tries to get back all of the REM sleep that it's lost. Does it get back all of the REM sleep? No, it doesn't. It never gets back all of the REM sleep, but it tries. And so you have these really intense periods of REM sleep. Hence you have really intense bizarre dreams. And that's what happens also with THC, you build up this pressure for REM sleep, this debt for REM sleep, will you ever pay it back? Doesn't seem as though you get back everything that you lost, but will you get back some of it? Yes, the brain will start to devour more because it's been starved of REM sleep for so long. But one of the bigger problems with THC that we worry about is withdrawal dependency. So as you start to use THC for sleep, there can be a dependency tolerance. So you start to need more to get the same sleep benefit. And when you stop using, you usually get a very severe rebound insomnia. And in fact, it's so potent that it's typically part of the clinical withdrawal profile from THC from cannabis. - And there's anxiety withdrawal. I you know, I don't ask anybody to change their behavior, we just as you said, we try and inform people about what the science says and let them make choices for themselves. People who are regular pot smokers, if you many of will insist they're not addicted, and maybe indeed they don't actually follow the profile of classical addiction, I don't know. I'm guessing some do, some don't. But if you ask them well, what if I took away all marijuana consumption for, I don't know, two weeks? That thought scares many of them. And many of them will experience intense anxiety without marijuana, which speaks to perhaps not addiction, but a certain kind of dependency. And again, you know, I know many pot smokers, some of whom have jobs that are quite high performing and they manage. - Here in Berkeley, I don't know any of those. - Yeah, none of those, right. What about CBD? I mean, we hear so much about CBD, I've been a little concerned about the fact that the analysis of a lot of CBD supplements out there has confirmed that much like with melatonin, the levels that are reported on the labels, in no way shape, or form, match the levels that are actually contained in the various supplements. Sometimes the levels are much higher than they're reported on the labels. Other times, it's much lower. What does ingesting CBD do to the architecture and quality of sleep? - Right now, I don't think we have enough data to make some kind of, you know, meaningful sense out of it. I think the picture that is emerging, however, is probably the following. Firstly, CBD does not seem to be detrimental in the same ways that THC is. So we can start by saying does it create you know, potential problems, not of the nature necessarily that we see with THC. But the devil is a little bit in the details from the data that we do have and it comes on to your valid point of purity. At low dose, CBD can seem to be wake promoting. So in lower doses, let see sort of five or 10 milligrams and trying to remember some of the studies off the top of my head, there it actually may enhance wakefulness and cause problems with sleep. It's only once you get into the higher dose range, that there seem to have been some, you know, increases sorry, increases in sleepiness, or sort of sedation like, increases. And that's usually I think, above about 25 milligrams, as best I can recall from the data. And then when we look in animal models, you typically see the same type of profile too. So then the question becomes and now again, you just don't know about, you know, purity. It's very difficult, although I think, and again, I'm not a user, not necessarily because I you know, have anything against it. It's just that's not, you know, necessarily my cup of tea. There are some firms that are now doing third party independent laboratory tests. I don't know how gamed that is, so I've got no sense of it. - I think some supplement companies are quite honest and accurate about the amounts of various substances that are in their products and some are not. And I think there's just a huge range. I think the FDA is starting to explore CBD there I certainly I saw some grant announcements to explore the function of CBD. Most of the work on CBD is being done by the general public adjusting it and seeing how they feel. I gave it to my dog who was had some dementia related sleep disturbances, and it actually created a heightened wakefulness it completely screwed up his sleep. - Okay, it sounds as though it just wasn't. - He's a bulldog. So if he's going to get access to sleep, he's going to take it. - Okay. - Really messed him up, took him took it away, he did better. But you know, that's a canine, so. - Right, and it could have been, you know, sort of dose related too. - Or binders or other things that are in there, sure. - Correct, yeah and we, but right now, if we were to, and I'm not making the statement, I don't think anyone can make the statement now. But if it ends up being that CBD is potentially beneficial for sleep, how can we reconcile that mechanistically? And I think there are, to me, at least, there are at least three candidate mechanisms that I've been exploring and thinking about. The first is that it's thermo regulatory. And what we found in some animal models is that CBD will create a profile of hypothermia. In other words, it cools the body the core body temperature down. And that's something that we know is good for sleep. The second is that it's an anxyolitic, that it can reduce anxiety. And that data is actually quite strong, even with some functional imaging work that's been coming out recently showing that one epicenter of emotion called the amygdala deep within the brain is quietened down with CBD. So I think that's at least a second non mutually exclusive. - That's great, that's conducive. - You know, possibility. I think the third is some recent data that's come out that was suggesting that CBD can alter the signaling of adenosine. So it doesn't necessarily mean that you produce more adenosine, but what it can do is perhaps modulate the sensitivity perhaps of the brain, so that the weight of that same adenosine is weightier in its brain signal, and therefore it creates this stronger pressure for sleep. So I think these are all tentative mechanisms. I think any one of them is viable, I think all three are viable together. But right now I think, does that sort of help think through the tapestry of THC and CBD? - Yeah very much so and actually, it's a perfect segue from we've talked about caffeine, alcohol, THC and CBD as sort of, we framed them anyway, as things that done in moderation at the appropriate times, are probably okay for most people. Certainly not for everybody, there will be differences in sensitivity. But that done at the incorrect times, and certainly in the incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt this vital stage of life we call sleep. CBD, it seems, represents a kind of bridge to the topic I'd like to talk about next, which is things that promotes more healthy sleep, or somehow contribute to enhancing the architecture and quality of sleep. So I'd love to chat for a moment about the kind of grand, the original I should say that not the granddaddy but the OG of sleep supplementation, which is melatonin. The so called hormone of darkness that's inhibited by light, etcetera. Frame for us, melatonin in the context of its naturally occurring form. And then I'd like to talk about melatonin the supplement because in my experience, anytime I say the word melatonin, people think about the supplement melatonin, which in itself is an interesting phenomenon that people are so cued to its role as something you take, we often forget that this is something that we make endogenously. I'd love for you to comment in particular on even though without necessarily getting into its precise nanograms per deciliter values, what are the typical amounts of melatonin that we release each night? And then I'd like to compare that to what is contained in say a three milligram or six milligram tablet that one might buy at the pharmacy. - Right, yeah. - So I go to sleep at night, has melatonin already kicked in before I shut my eyes and lay down my head? - Usually, yes, if your system is working in the correct way, as dusk is starting to happen, so let's say that you look at hunter gatherer tribes who aren't touched by electricity, and so that's sort of the puritanical state par excellence when it comes to electric light influence. And usually, it's as dusk is approaching, that's when melatonin will start to rise. And so when you lose the brake pedal of light coming through the eyes, that normally acts like a hard brake pedal that stamps down and prevents the release and production of melatonin. As that light brake pedal starts to fade with dusk, then we ease off the brake pedal and melatonin the spigot of melatonin is opened up, and melatonin starts getting released. And usually we'll see this rising peak of melatonin sometime, usually an hour, two hours later or around and it varies from different people around the time of sleep itself. But it's already been on the march for some hours before you actually hit sleep itself. - Interesting, and I was always taught and I'm assuming it's still true that the only source of melatonin in the brain and body is the pineal gland. Is that still true? - Yeah, it seems to be from best that we can tell the pineal gland sort of meaning pea like sort of shape. It's actually I think usually people say it's pea like, I think if you look at the Latin derivative, it's more, I think it's derived from pine cone, not pea because in fact, if you look at the pineal, it is more pine cone shaped and so is aptly named. - Any human brain I've ever dissected or I confess I've dissected a lot 'cause I teach neuroanatomy and have for years. I love looking at the pineal it's the one structure in the brain that's not on both sides. It's usually pretty easy to find. And it's a pretty good size. It looks like a, it looks like a pea. And it's sitting right there. And it's remarkable that it releases this hormone. Sort of probably our entire lifespan is inhibited by light. So our pineal starts to release this into the general circulation. I have to imagine we have melatonin receptors in the brain and body. - It's correct, so yep, essentially, your brain has a central Master 24 hour clock called the super charismatic nucleus that keeps internal time. Now it's not a precise clock if left to its own devices, nothing that a Swiss clock maker would be proud of. It runs a little bit long and laggy. - It's like an American clock. There are a couple of good American watches by the way, Hamilton's are very nice, but. - It's very much like a bug. - We're not famous for our timekeeping or our punctuality for that matter, but the Swiss are. - It's very it's not quite Swiss, like it's more Berkeley like, which is very relaxed. Oh you know what whatever. So in most adults, the average adult, I should say, your biological clock normally runs a little bit long, it's about 24 hours and 30 minutes, I think was the last calculation. But the reason that we don't keep drifting forward in time and kind of running consistently, you know, more and later and later, 30 minutes by 30 minutes by 30 minutes each day, is because your central brain clock is regulated by external things such as daylight and temperature, as well as food and activity. All of these are essentially different fingers that come along and on the wristwatch of the 24 hour clock will pull the dial out and reset it each day to precisely 24 hours. And I make that point because it knows 24 hour time, but it needs to tell the rest of the brain and the body, the 24 hour time as well. And one of the ways that it does this is by communicating a chemical signal of 24 hour nurse of light and day using this hormone, melatonin. And when it is at low levels, or it's non existent, it's communicating the message it's daytime, and for us diurnal species, it says it's time to be awake. Yet, at nighttime, when dusk approaches and the break comes off melatonin and we start to release it, then it signals to the rest of the brain and the body, look, it's dusk and it's nighttime. And for us diurnal species, it's time to think about sleep. So melatonin essentially tells the brain and the body when it's day and when it's night, and with that when it's time to sleep when it's time to wake. And therefore, that's why melatonin helps with the timing of the onset of sleep. But it doesn't really help with the generation of sleep itself. And this is why we'll come on to what those studies of supplementation have taught us. - So it tells the rest of my brain and body, it's time to go to sleep. It perhaps even aids with the transition to sleep but it's not going to for instance, ensure the overall structure of sleep or it's not the conductor that's guiding the sleep orchestra so to speak throughout the entire night. - Yeah, it's. - It's more like the people that essentially take you to your seat and sit you down and give you your program. - Right, exactly yeah, sort of the the fall, less sophisticated analogy I have is, you know, melatonin is like the starting official at the 100 meter race in the Olympics. - That's a better analogy, yeah. - It calls all of the sleep racers to the line and it begins the great sleep race. - Yeah, better analogy by the way. - [Matthew] It doesn't help dissipate, no, no, no, no. - Coming from the sleep researcher of all people. - But it doesn't participate in the race itself. That's a whole different set of brain chemicals and brain regions. Which then brings us on to perhaps the question of supplementation, which is, is it helpful for my sleep? Will I sleep longer? Will I sleep better? And if I am, what dosage should I be taking? Sadly, the evidence in healthy adults who are not older age suggests that melatonin is not really particularly helpful as a sleep aid. I think there's a recent meta analysis that demonstrated when it looked at all of the different sleep parameters, melatonin, and a meta analysis for those not knowing what that is, it's a scientific sort of method that we use where we gather all the individual studies and we put them in a big bucket and we kind of do this kind of statistical fancy sleight of hand. And we try to come up with a big picture of what all of those individuals studies tell us. And what that meta analysis told us is that melatonin will only increase total amount of sleep by 3.9 minutes, on average. - Minutes? - [Matthew] Minutes. - Not even percent. - And it will only increase your sleep efficiency by 2.2%. So it really. - This is as they say, in certain parts of California, that's weak sauce, that's a weak sauce effect. - The sauce is not strong, the force is not strong in this one, when it comes to a tool that in healthy people who are not of older age, it doesn't seem to be especially beneficial. Now, you know, results can vary. Everyone is different, of course. So we're talking about the average, the so called average human adult here. - Well, melatonin, in defense of what you're saying and also I should mention, I have a colleague at Stanford, Jamie Seitzer. - Oh, wonderful, genius. - Chuck Seitzer's lab at Harvard Med where he also trained terrific sleep researcher and I asked him about melatonin and he essentially said the same thing that you just said which is very little if any evidence that it can improve sleep and yet it's probably the most commonly consumed so called sleep aid. - Hundreds of million dollars industry. - Yeah, so either massive placebo effect or it's operating through some other mechanism related to quelling anxiety perhaps? - Well, yeah, that's essentially interesting, you know, there are some studies where you do see some, you know, effects. Now, again, when you do the grand average of all studies, it just doesn't seem to have an effect. But let's assume that for some people, it does have an effect let's not again be sort of completely dismissive of that, how could it have that effect? One of the reasons that I've become a little bit more bullish on melatonin from a sleep perspective and then melatonin more generally for a, maybe you can speak about this too, as a counter measure when you're undergoing insufficient sleep. There are two different routes there. The first reason that I think it could have a sleep benefit for some people is not because it helps in the generation of sleep, we know that it doesn't, it's because it too seems to drop core body temperature. - There it is, temperature again. I'm fascinated these days, more and more by temperature, as maybe not just a reflection of brain state and wakefulness and in sleep, but actually a lever that is quite powerful. - I think it's both. - And with all the interest in ice baths and hot showers and saunas and stuff, something that we will definitely touch on. Temperature variation is so key. So if melatonin is dropping body temperature by a degree or so something that you've said before can help induce a sleepy state. Maybe that's what's allowing people to get in to sleep. - I think that's one possibility. I don't think melatonin by itself will drop it by it sort of, you know, a degree, certainly not a degree Celsius. And for order in us to fall asleep, and then stay asleep across the night, we do need to drop our core body temperature by about one degree Celsius, or about two to three degrees Fahrenheit. And that's why it's always easier to fall asleep in a room that's too cold than too hot. I think that that's one potential avenue that we are considering thinking more deeply about when it comes to melatonin. And then the other is melatonin as an antioxidant. But let me table that for now. 'Cause I'll just get us sidetracked. That's what we know so far about melatonin in terms of its supplementation benefit or lack thereof. Two final points that I shouldn't forget, one is the only population where we typically see some benefit, and it often is prescribed is in older adults, because as we. - Older meaning 60 and older? - Yeah, 60, 65 and older because as we get older, you can typically have what's called calcification of the pineal gland. Which means that that gland that's releasing melatonin doesn't work as well anymore. As a consequence, they tend to have a flatter overall curve of melatonin release throughout the night. It's not this beautiful, lovely peak, and this bullhorn message of its darkness, please get to sleep. That's why older adults can have problems falling asleep or staying asleep. It's not the only reason by any stretch of the imagination. But it's one of the reasons and it's why melatonin supplementation in those cohorts, older adults, and especially older adults with insomnia, people have thought about that as maybe an appropriate use case. - Well, along those lines, if we were to compare dosages, I don't, do we know how much melatonin is typically released into the bloodstream per night? And can we use that as a kind of a rule of thumb by which to compare the typical amount that someone would supplement? Typically, the supplements for melatonin that I see in the pharmacy and elsewhere online range anywhere from one milligram to 12, or even 20 milligrams. My guess is that a normal night's release of melatonin typical for somebody in their 20s, 30s, 40s would be far lower than that, am I correct or wrong? - Yeah, it's many magnitudes lower. And this is one of the problems is that I see that too. I see, you know, typical doses are, you know, five milligrams or 10 milligrams and of course, you know, if you're a supplement company, you know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams, if that's what you're actually doing, which we'll speak about purity as well. You know, it's kind of like the super gulp size, nobody wants to lower price, they just want you to you know, we'll just give you more for the same price. And that's how we'll compete. So it's been this escalating arms race of melatonin concentration, and it really does not look meaningful for, you know, for sleep in any way. What we've actually found is that the optimal doses for where you do get sleep benefits in the populations that we've looked at, are somewhere between 0.1 and 0.3 milligrams of melatonin. In other words, the typical doses are usually 10 times, 20 times maybe more than what your body would naturally expect. And this is what we call a supra physiological dose. In other words, it's far above what is physiologically normal? You know, and to put that in context, imagine I said to you, I want you to eat 20 times as much food today. - I thought you're going to use testosterone as example. You're going to take 300 times the normal amount of testosterone we know that would have tons of deleterious effects it would be terrible. And yet you can do this. One thing that I'm concerned about about these super physiological levels of melatonin is that many years ago, actually, here at Berkeley, when I was a graduate student, we would inject animals which were seasonally breeding animals with melatonin. And the consequence of that was that their gonads, either their testes or ovaries would shrink, many hundred fold or more. In other words, they would go from having nice healthy sized hamster testicles, what a hamster would consider healthy size for a hamster and they would shrink to the size of a grain of rice. So from like an almonds to a grain size of a grain of rice. I had to see that only once for me to be very concerned about super physiological levels of melatonin. And I realized that melatonin does different things in different species. We are not hamsters, we are not seasonal breeders seasonally restricted breeders, there might be more breeding during certain seasons, I don't know those data. But nonetheless, hormones are powerful. And sure there is an optimal, and sometimes we see that going slightly above endogenous levels for certain hormones not always, can have beneficial effects. And sometimes it can have detrimental effects. I'm just concerned about taking high levels of a hormone that has effects on the reproductive axis and that's one of the reasons why I get very concerned when I see people really getting aggressive about melatonin supplementation taking 100, 10, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times the amount that we would normally release. That's my concern, although it's not nested in any one specific human study. I just don't like to see, I certainly don't want to see other people and I don't want to personally take a hormone that's known to be androgen suppressive at high levels. Why would I take that? That's the question I ask myself. - I think it's a very, you know, good point. And if you look at some of the evidence around, you know, melatonins lethality if you want to go to that extreme, for the most part, you know, it's pretty safe. - You mean, you can take a lot of it before you die? - Right, exactly yeah. - But I don't know that that's the criteria. - That should be your yardstick for, because, you know, you really need to think about your, you know, your health, not just whether this thing is going to kill you or not as the decision matrix through which you pop a pill. And it comes on to this concern around melatonin because there was a study, I think it's one that you mentioned too where they looked at over, I think it was at least over 20 different brands of melatonin supplements. And what they found is that based on what it said, on the bottle versus what was in the capsules themselves, it ranged from, I think it was 83% less than what it said on the bottle to 478% more than what it said on the bottle. Now, if that's a 10 milligram, you know, pill, and it's 478% more than 10 milligrams, and we're already at 10 milligrams at many tens of times more than is a physiological rather than a supra physiological dose, we do need to be a bit thoughtful. - Yeah, remember those hamsters folks. Well, and I do appreciate the deep dive on melatonin because I think people need to understand that it's nuanced, it's a matter of dosages, and timing, etcetera. And then it may have its place as you mentioned in older individuals. And I should mention that I'm an avid consumer of supplements that I believe in for me and I have been for a very long time. So I'm by no means anti supplement. Some supplements I refuse to take or avoid taking others I quite avidly take and along those lines, I personally and I don't know what your thoughts on this are. But there are a few things that I've personally found beneficial. I love your thoughts on them. And I would love it if you would tell me that everything I'm about to refer to is placebo, that would be fine. So that's what we do, we're scientists we argue and then we remain friends in as it goes away. So magnesium, there are many forms of magnesium. Magnesium citrate is a as we know, is a terrific laxative. Magnesium malate seems, at least from a few studies seems to relieve some of delayed onset muscle soreness doesn't seem to create a kind of sedation. Two forms of magnesium that I'm aware of magnesium biglycinate and magnesium threonate. We believe based on the data can more actively cross the blood brain barrier. So you put in your gut, but some of that needs to go into your brain in order to have the sedative effect. What are your thoughts on magnesium supplementation? Do you supplement with magnesium? And what studies would you like to see done if they haven't been done already. - So I don't supplement with magnesium. But I do think threonate is interesting because of that higher capacity to cross the blood brain barrier and actually have a central nervous system effect. And the reason that that interests me is because the sleep is by the brain of the brain, and also for the brain, as well as for the body. We just don't have a particularly good set of studies that have targeted exclusively threonate. We do have lots of studies that have just looked at magnesium in general for sleep. And overall, the data is uncompelling. - Interesting. - And for a while, I was confused as to why, where did this come from this kind of myth of magnesium? So I started looking back into the literature and I've best traced it at least as far as I can tell, to early studies showing that those who are deficient in magnesium also had sleep problems. They had other problems too, of course, but sleep problems were one of that set of sequelae that came from having lower magnesium. And when they supplemented with magnesium and tried to restore those levels, some of those sleep problems dissipated. And then that seems to have gotten lost in sort of some game of sort of like whispers around the room and it's become translated into people who don't have sleep problems, who are healthy sleepers, and who are healthy in general, and who have healthy normal levels of magnesium, if they take more magnesium, they will sleep better. And the data really, there is not good. Once again, the only study that I've seen where magnesium did have some efficacy was in a study with older adults, I think they were 60 to 80 years old, it may have been exclusively women, now I think about it and they also had insomnia. And in that population, you did see some benefits. And my guess is that because it's an older community as well, they were probably deficient in magnesium. So they fit the former category of simply when you're deficient, and you restore, you can help sleep sort of return to normal. But if you are not deficient and you're healthy, and you're not old and you don't have insomnia, and you're supplementing thinking that it provides sleep, right now, the data isn't supportive of that. But I just don't think we have enough threonate data to actually speak about that, because it could just be a blood brain barrier issue so far with the other forms. - So maybe some additional studies looking specifically at threonate or bi-glycinate would be useful. - I'd love to have. - Magnesium is involved in so many cellular processes, you can imagine that this effect, if it truly exists is, as we say, in science in the noise, meaning it's in the jitter of the data, but to isolate the real effect one needs to do some more refined studies. What are some things that are of interest to you, if not things that you happen to take? These are not things that I personally take mostly because I just haven't experimented with them. valerian root is one, tart cherry and kiwi fruit. Tell me about Valerian root, tart cherry and kiwi fruit. This is new to me. I have certainly heard of them. And tart cherry and Kiwi sounds delicious, but what's happening with Valerian root tart cherry and kiwi and are we talking about eating tart cherries and Kiwis and Valerian roots? - Yes. - Or are talking about taking them in pill form? - Usually it's supplements, but it's also both for tart cherries and for kiwis. It's the actual, you know, fruit themselves. Valerian often touted as a beneficial sleep aid and lots of people swear by it too. But the evidence is actually quite against that. - Oh really? - Not that it makes your sleep worse, but of at least the seven good studies that I've been able to find, and typically these are of the nature of what we call a randomized placebo crossover design. And I won't bore people with what that means it's sort of one of the. - Good studies, solid studies. - Yeah, it's one of the sort of gold standard methods that we have when we're looking at intervention studies such as drugs studies. Five of the seven found no benefits of Valerian root on sleep. Then two out of the seven, the data was just insufficient. I think it was a power issue where they just couldn't make any strong conclusions. And then I think there was the most recent study, I think looked at two different doses of Valerian and I could have this wrong and they just failed to find any effects once again, but the stunning part of that paper, as I recall, they had this big table with all of the different sleep metrics that they looked at. And there were well over 25 different things that they tried to see if valerian impacted. And none of them were significant. Which stuns me because from statistical probabilities, we know, if you just randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances are probabilistically, you'll just get one significant result by random chance. And even with random chance on their side, they still couldn't find a benefit of Valerian, so. - So Valerian root might be worse than nothing at all, if there is, so to speak. - I mean, again, placebo effect we can think about that too. And I would say that if you feel as though it's having a benefit for you, and with all of the caveats that we have with supplements, things like melatonin purity, concentration, et cetera, you know, maybe it's no harm no foul. But I'm not a you know, a medical doctor and I don't tell anyone about we have all of these disclaimers about not recommending such things. - And we'll include these, I mean, I always say, you know, we're not physicians, we don't prescribe anything. We're scientists and professors so we profess things. It's up to people to be responsible for their own health. Not just to protect us but to protect themselves. I do want to hear about tart cherry and kiwi fruit. What's the story there? - Strange, isn't it? I was, you know, I'm kind of a hard nosed scientist, and when people you know, some years ago started saying, oh, tart cherries, it's the thing or kiwi fruits, I was thinking, oh, my goodness, the sounds a bit. - You've been in California a little too long. - Yeah, I know, yeah, the sun is softened me some. But I thought, look one of the things that we have to do as scientists is be as open minded as possible. And I should not be so quick to dismiss. So I went to the literature just started reading as much as I could about it. And there were three really good randomized placebo crossover trials with tart cherries. And what they found was that in one study, it reduced the amount of time that you spent awake at night by over an hour. And then the other two studies, one of them found that it increased the amount of sleep that you've got by 34 minutes. The other it increased the amount of sleep that you got by 84 minutes. Which you know, these are, and what's striking is that they were independent studies, I think, meaning that they were from independent groups, and these were, you know, some of these guys, you know, and girl, I know pretty well, and they are really. - You know and trust their work. - Right, I really trust their work too. - Were they ingesting actual tart cherries or they're drinking the juice or in capsule form? - It was juice. So they in all three studies, it was juice. Although you can I think as a supplement, you can buy it in a capsule, and we've got no idea whether that changes the benefit or not. What was also interesting in I think it was that last study where they got an increase in sleep by 84 minutes, it also decreased a daytime napping significantly. - That's one that I could certainly make use of. I love my day time naps, but I'd love to skip them too. - Right and we can speak about naps and sort of the upside and downside of that. Which then made me think well, if that's the case, may be the net net benefit on sleep overall, is no different. It's just that it decreases the amount of time that some people were taking to sleep during the day, and giving it back to the night. But that wasn't the case, 'cause if you added the total amount of sleep that they were getting without tart cherries, both naps and nightly sleep combined, still, when you took tart cherries, you still got a net some benefit, of total amount of sleep. So you know, so far, when it comes to supplements, and those types of studies, they're good studies, and the data looks interesting. But as a drug itself, you know, if this was clinical drug, you know, three studies that are somewhat small in nature and have some positive benefit that's what we would call preliminary data of maybe a chin scratching kind so keep this in context. - Yeah, and depending on the margins for safety, one might think, well, given that it's a tart cherry as opposed to some pharmaceutical you need a prescription for then, you know, some people their threshold to experiment with supplements is quite low, some people their threshold is quite high. I feel like you know, there are two categories, or at least two categories of folks out there. People who hear oh, tart cherry can improve sleep, and we'll run out and try it. And people who hear well, that sounds crazy. Why would I do that? But of course, we have to remind people that tart cherry isn't really what we're talking about, presumably if this is a real effect, and sounds like it might be that there's a compound in tart cherries. - That's right. - That if we were to call it, whatever, whatever five alpha six, you know, some molecule, if we refer to it by its technical name, then people would say, oh, that sounds like a very interesting technical way to approaches sleep but doesn't sound very natural. So both groups are a little bit misguided in the sense that people who think that everything that comes from naturally occurring foods, plants, etcetera, things that grow out of the ground, that that's all safe, that's not true. And people that think that pharmaceuticals are the if it's not evidence with the purified molecule, then something's not of utility. Well, that's certainly not true. somewhere in the middle, I think lies the answer, which is, it sounds to me like tart cherry is at least an intriguing potential sleep aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid and underscoring potential. I'm certainly intrigued by it to the point where I might experiment a bit, but I'm an experimenter for myself. Before I ask you about kiwi, I've had quite good results from taking something called apigenin, which is a derivative of chamomile. But in supplement form, I think I take 50 milligrams about 30 minutes before sleep. And I subjectively experience a better night's sleep, so to speak. I don't measure I confess, I don't measure my sleep. I'm not a sleep tracker guy. But, you know, there are a few papers out there they're not what we would call blue published in Blue Ribbon journals, but they have control groups, and it looks somewhat interesting. And there when I say apigenin people get somewhat intrigued oh this molecule. Chamomile has long been thought to be a sedative, a mild sedative, but a sedative? Do you drink chamomile tea? Do you take apigenin? What are your thoughts on apigenin? - Yeah, I don't. And I have looked into some of the data regarding sleep as well. Right now from best I can tell it's mostly subjective data rather than objective hard sort of sleep measures. And that's why right now I you know, it's sort of unclear not no comment, but just unclear, not dismissing it, because I think you and I both ascribe to the idea of absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. So keep your mind open, at least I tell that to myself. I think if you're finding a benefit, and you can do what I would think of if I was personally experimenting, which is both the positive and negative parts of the experiment, what I mean by that is, you know, let's say that I now want to, you know, think about some kind of sleep supplement, I will take some kind of baseline set of recordings for a month, and I will just gauge where I'm at, sort of supplement free. Then I'll go on for a month or two, whatever I'm thinking of taking, and I don't, you know, supplement. But let's say that I want to and I experiment with that. And I feel as though based on my metrics be them objective from my aura ring or be them subjective from whatever I'm, you know, writing down in the morning, and both are important and valid, subjective and objective, we like both in the sleep world. And I think, okay, look, it's clearly that it seems to have some kind of an effect. The key thing, however, is then do the negative experiment, which is now come off it for another month, and see, do things get worse. And if I can see that by directionality, then I'm starting to think maybe I'm believing this a little bit more. So that's the way I would sort of typically approach you know, a supplementation regiment if I were to do it. And that's just me, that's just the way my mind works, but. - No, that's great. I think it's very scientific and organized in a way that allows you and would allow other people to make very informed decisions for themselves. I like that. I like to think in terms of manipulating any aspect of our biology, that behavioral tools always are the first line of entry, then nutrition, everyone has to eat sooner or later, even if you're fasting, then perhaps supplementation, then prescription drugs, and then perhaps brain machine interface, devices that you use to induce something. And those can be done in combination. But what concerns me is when I hear people say, well, what should I take without thinking about their behavior, their light viewing behavior, etcetera. But of course, these things work in combination. - And I think it's, you're right, that there's many when it comes to sleep, there are many low hanging fruits that don't necessarily require you to, you know, put sort of exogenous molecules in other words things like supplements into your body or, you know, use different types of drugs to help you get there. Now, when it comes to prescription sleep aids, I think I've been again a little bit too forthright. We know in clinical practice that there may be a time and a place for things like sleeping pills, they are a short term solution to certain forms of insomnia, but they are not recommended for the long term. And we also know that there are lots of other ways that you can get a sleep help or you can get a sleep curative profile from things like cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, which is a non drug approach, psychological. - And quite effective from what I understand, good data. - Just as effective as sleeping pills, great data more effective in the long term. There's a recent study published that after working with a therapist, some of the benefits lasted almost a decade, you know, now, if you stop sleeping pills, usually you have rebound insomnia, where your sleep goes back to being just as bad if not worse. And I think the same is true, when we think about supplementation, there are so many things that are easy to implement when it comes to sleep, that don't require venturing out into those waters. And again, we're not here to tell anyone about whether they should venture or not, that's completely your choice. All I'm saying is that if you want to think about optimizing your sleep, there are a number of ways that you can do it that don't necessarily require you to swallow anything or inject anything or you know, smoking or anything, or free base. - And of which the margins of safety are quite quite wide. That's the other one. - Yes, right thank you. So speaking of low hanging fruit, I don't know how it hangs in reality, but what about kiwi? They're delicious to me anyway. - Yeah, the humble kiwi fruit named not shouldn't be mistaken for the flightless bird of New Zealand, which is the native bird there. We're talking about the kiwi the fruit here, which those trees and shrubs are mostly South East Asia. Kiwi fruits have been previously touted as potentially having a sleep benefit, which again got me curious and I at first threw it out. To my knowledge, there's really only one published human study that's of any value. But what they did find was that it decreased the speed of time with which it took you to fall asleep. - These are you ingesting the whole kiwi. So it's ingesting the whole kiwi. - With the skin, I eat the skin, people cringe when they see me, or don't eat the skin? - Well, I think, no, no, no, I think the idea is some of the good stuff and I'll come on to this may actually be in the skin itself. - Oh wonderful, thank you. You just helped me win a bet. I'll give you your cut. - Okay, okay, yeah, you can pay me later. By the way this skin is use? No, no, no. He just told me to say that's how he wins, no, he did not. So the skin seems to be part of this potential sleep equation. And that study, you fell asleep faster and you stayed asleep for longer and you spent less time awake throughout the night. And I just thought, well, you know, that's one study, what can you really do with that? There was another study, however, in an animal model, which is, you know, a little bit more interesting. And once again, they found a very similar phenotype that the rats, sorry they were mice, the mice fell asleep faster. And they also spent longer time in sleep. The sleep duration also increased. What was also interesting mechanistically and this is not the mechanism that I think ties together tart cherries, kiwi fruit, and you know things like melatonin, because I think there could be one common binding mechanism. What they found in the animal study is that they could block those kiwifruit sleep benefits using a GABA blocking agent. Now GABA which stands for Gamma Amino Butyric Acid is one of the major inhibitory neurotransmitters of the brain. It's kind of like the red. - So a naturally occurring sedative, sort of? - Yeah, it's the kind of the red light on the traffic light signal, you know, others are green light. GABA is red light. So by playing around with some sort of clever drugs to manipulate the system, they could prevent the benefit of the kiwi fruit by sort of buggering around with the GABA receptor, meaning that perhaps part of the kiwi fruit benefit on sleep was mediated by the brain's natural inhibitory neurotransmitter system called the GABA system. - That's exciting. - And I thought that that was kind of, that convinced me a little bit more that maybe there's something here to read into. So to be determined, again, here is the banner, but you know, tart cherries and kiwi fruits the data surprised me, because in part I was so preoccupied with being you know, I don't know a bit pure-ish about and a bit snobby thinking come on, that's definitely not going to work, well the data certainly found out. [cross talking] - I look forward to a day when supplements are no longer called supplements, because at the end of the day, whether or not something has an effect, whether or not it's a whole kiwi fruit or a derivative of kiwi fruit will depend on the molecular compound. And as you mentioned, this potential mechanism via the GABA system, we both as scientists get excited about mechanism 'cause when you can trace a mechanism and a pathway it provides a rationale a grounding for why kiwi of all things or tart cherry of all things might help increase total sleep time. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention or ask about tryptophan and serotonin. I can anecdotally say, when I've taken tryptophan, the precursor to serotonin, or serotonin itself, I have a horrendous night's sleep. I fall asleep very easily. And I experience ridiculously vivid dreams. Neither pleasant nor unpleasant is kind of a mishmash. And then I wake up and I experience several days of insomnia. That and I've done the positive control and the negative control and all the variations there of to confirm that, at least for me supplementing with serotonergic agents is a bad idea for me. And tryptophan is a common sleep supplement and sleep aid that's discussed. The normal architecture of sleep involves the release of serotonin, but in a very timed and regulated way. What are your thoughts about serotonin in sleep? If you had to kind of put that into a nutshell. And then why supplementing with serotonin and or its precursor, tryptophan might be a good or a bad idea for somebody. - I think one of the potential dangers is that based on what's going on in your body, that can change the absorption of natural sort of tryptophan and serotonin uptake within the brain itself. So I'm always thoughtful when you're playing around with that mother nature dynamic as it were. The data as you described is a little bit all over the map. Some people say that it knocks them out other people say just like you do, it has a terrible impact on my sleep. And when I stop, it's pretty bad for a couple of days, it seems to have this lingering after effect. I think what could be happening here is we need serotonin to just as you described, to be modulated in very specific ways during the different stages of sleep. If you look at the firing of the brain epicenters where serotonin is released, and there's a bunch of them in the brainstem, what you find, and the release of serotonin too, when we're awake, it's usually in high concentrations, as we start to drift off to sleep, it lowers some, but not necessarily dramatically as we're going into non REM sleep. But then when we go into REM sleep serotonin is shut off. The other, one of the other neuromodulators noradrenalin also shut off. REM sleep is the only time during the 24 hour period, where we see noradrenaline and serotonin or norepinephrine, completely shut down. When I say serotonin, we're also talking 5-HTP, sorry, 5-HT, that's just its chemical name here. So whether it was speaking about serotonin or 5-HT is the same thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, both of those need to be shut down for you to produce REM sleep. The other, one of the other neuromodulators, that then ramps up to produce REM sleep is acetylcholine. So these three neuromodulators have this incredible reciprocal dance that they have for you to generate what is called a natural architecture of sleep throughout the night. - It's the push pull again. - It's a push pull again, you know, it's you know, it's just and back. It's, you know, whatever you want to think of. That's why I think if you're trying to increase dramatically drive up your serotonin levels at night, and that sustains throughout the night, when you're trying to get into REM sleep, you could be artificially fragmenting REM sleep. Now, I don't know the data, I don't think anyone's really got the data. - No, I haven been able to find it. - But that's why I would be, you know if you were to say, Matt, two years time, that's the data helped me understand the potential mechanism or let's design some experiments, where would you go first? I would say let's look at the disruption of REM sleep, non REM sleep, reciprocal regulation, because, you know, you need serotonin to be, you know, up at one time down at another, so. - I agree with everything you said. And I'm personally never taking tryptophan or serotonin again, unless there's some clinical reason for that that I would need to do that. I want to ask about some other pro sleep behaviors. But before I do that, let's talk about naps. I love naps. I come from a long history of nappers. My dad always took a nap in the afternoon, I take a 20 or 30 minute nap or I do a practice which I took the liberty of coining NSDR, non sleep deep rest, some sort of just passive laying out their feet up elevated. Sometimes people do you or I'll do yoga Nidra, I'll do hypnosis or something of that sort, but 20 or 30 minutes of that has been very beneficial for me to get up from that nap or period of minimal wakefulness, we'll call it and go about my day quite well, and also fall asleep just fine. What are the data on naps? Do you nap? And what are your thoughts about keeping naps short meaning 20 to 30 minutes versus getting out past 90 minutes, two hours? So for you personally naps, yay, nay or meh? - I don't nap. And I've just never been a habitual napper. - Is that because you don't feel sleepy in the afternoon, or because? - I typically don't feel sleepy? - So you're just hardier then. - I am, I wouldn't say hardier, I may be less capable of falling asleep, my sleep drive. - But you're not dragging through the afternoon? - No, no, I don't drag through out the. - So you don't nap because you don't feel a need to nap? - That's right, yep. Now, it's not that I am immune to what we call the postprandial dip in alertness. I definitely feel as though there can be this kind of afternoon lull, where, you know, I'm not quite as on as I was at 11 o'clock in the morning. And we know the physiology to that, which brings us back to whether we were designed to nap. So for naps, we've done lots of different studies and other colleagues have done these studies too. Naps can have some really great benefits, we found benefits for cardiovascular health, blood pressure, for example, we found benefits for levels of cortisol, we found benefits for learning and memory, and also emotional regulation. - How long are the naps, typically, in those studies? - Anywhere between 20 minutes to 90 minutes. Sometimes we like to use a 90 minute window so that the participant can have a full cycle of sleep, and therefore they get both non REM and REM sleep within that time period. Then when we wake them up, we usually wait a period of time to get them past what we call sleep inertia, which is that kind of window of grogginess where you say to you, better half look, you know, darling, please don't speak to me for the first hour after I've. - Don't anything right now. - After the first hour of waking up, you know, I'm not just, I'm just not the best version of myself. So we wait for that time period, and then we do some testing. And we've done some testing before and after, and we look at the change. And that's how we measure what was the benefit of naps and the reason why we sometimes do 90 minutes so that they get all of those stages of sleep. And then we correlate, how much benefit did you get from the nap, and how much of that benefit was explained by what REM sleep you got, what deep sleep you got, what light sleep you got? So that's the only reason that we use that as an experimental tool. What we've also found is that naps of as little as 17 minutes can have some quite potent effects on for example, learning. None of this is novel, NASA pioneered this back in the 1990s. And during the missions, they were experimenting with naps for their astronauts. And what they found was that naps of little as 26 minutes, improved mission performance by 34%, and improved daytime alertness by 50%. And it birthed what was then called the NASA nap culture throughout all terrestrial NASA staff during that time period. So it's long been known that naps can have a benefit. Naps, however, can have a double edged sword there is a dark side to naps. And it comes back to our story of adenosine and sleep pressure. The longer we're awake, the more of that sleep pressure adenosine that we build up. But what I didn't tell you is that when we sleep, the brain gets the chance to essentially clear out that adenosine. And after about 16 hours of wakefulness, and then after about eight hours of sleep, eight hours of sleep seems to be able to allow the brain to decrease its adenosine levels back to normal. And so naturally, we should start to wake up which also aligns with your circadian rhythm. And those are two separate processes. But with about eight hours of good quality sleep seven to nine hours for the average adult, we are free of all of that adenosine. We've evacuated it essentially out of the brain, and we wake up naturally feeling refreshed. The reason that naps can be potentially dangerous is that when you nap, you are essentially opening the valve on the pressure cooker of sleep pressure. And some of that sleepiness is lost by way of the nap. So for some people and not all people and you're a great example of this. Some people, however, if they are struggling with sleep at night, and they nap during the day, it makes their sleep problems even worse. So for people with insomnia, we typically advise against napping. And the advice is if you can nap regularly, and you don't struggle with sleep at night, then naps are just fine. But if you do struggle with sleep, stay away from naps. If you are going to nap, try to limit your naps, try to cut them off a bit like sort of caffeine, maybe you know, eight to 12 hours maybe not that you know far off maybe sort of seven to six hours is a good rule of thumb. Try not to nap essentially late in the afternoon. And if you do take a nap and you want to maintain your you don't want to have that grogginess hangover that can happen after a full night of sleep for the first hour, try to limit it to about 20, 25 minutes. And that way you don't go down into the very deepest stages of sleep, which if I wrench you out of with an alarm, then you just kind of feel you almost feel worse, for the first hour after the nap. - I've definitely experienced that if I oversleep. Certainly if the sun goes down during my nap and I wake up and light overall lighting conditions have changed, I find it very hard to jolt myself back into the evening. And it can screw me up. So I try and keep those naps pretty brief. And I should say, I'm very happy to hear you mention individual differences and why some people might want to nap and other people might not want to nap, I have a colleague Liqun Luo he'll be familiar to many neurobiologist. - Yeah of course. - Who's a absolutely spectacular scientist, member of the National Academy, Howard Hughes investigator just a phenom, and has a ton of energy. But years ago, I learned that he always takes a nap in the afternoon, so much so that when he travels to give seminars at other universities, he will tell his post lunch host whoever it is that he's supposed to meet with, may I have your office for 30 minutes of our, sometimes 30 minute discussion or 60 minute discussion, because I like to take a nap. And he does that and then gives us his, his talks are typically in the afternoon in academic culture. And he describes the effect of the nap for him this short naps in the afternoon being so profound for his productivity. That's actually what inspired me to start feeling okay about my desire to nap. And so I think for me, that was great vindication for those that might feel guilty about wanting a nap. But I take to heart your note about avoiding naps if you have trouble falling and staying asleep, 'cause I think that I have family members who also if they nap, they're a wreck, they can't sleep. - Yeah, I think it's just, we've often been very pro sleep with sort of the sleep community. So I think it's good to always point out these potential dark sides of any aspect. But you're absolutely right, no one should feel guilty about getting the sleep that they need. And I think that's been one of the big problems in society society has stigmatized sleep with these labels of being slothful or lazy. And we're almost embarrassed, you know, to tell colleagues that we take a nap. I think sleep is a write of human beings. And I therefore think that sleep is a civil right of all human beings. And no one should make you feel unproud of getting the sleep that you need. - No, I love that. And I it's an important point. I also feel that one of the best ways to beat your competition in any endeavor is to outlive them. So now that we know that sleep can enhance longevity and lack of sleep can shorten one's life, that's all the justification I need anyway. Can somebody sleep too much? Is it possible to get too much sleep? - It's a very good question. And there are probably two things to say about it, there is a condition that we call hypersomnia. But that's a mixture of things, it's where people have either a very high sleep need, or they are very sleepy during the day. And they're typically falling asleep. And these can happen in a variety of different clinical contexts. One of the places where we've often seen hypersomnia believed to manifest is in depression. But if you look at some of those studies, it turns out, it looks more as though those people are simply reporting being in bed longer, but not necessarily sleeping longer. And that fits very well with one of the profiles that we know of depression, which is anhedonia, you don't get pleasure from normally pleasurable things. So you just don't want to go out into the world, you don't want to interact because you're depressed. So what do you do? You just stay in bed? - Blinds closed, watching TV, on the phone. - [Matthew] Right, and that just looks as though you know, - Felling miserable. - When people say, what time did you go to bed? And what time did you get out of bed? The mistake made in that question is okay, that's how much time their sleeping when you should have said, what time did you fall asleep? And what time did you wake up? And the answer could be very different. So that's hypersomnia from a clinical context. Can you sleep too much though? One of the data points that argues yes, that's possible is when we look at all cause mortality. Certainly what you find is that using the sweet spot of seven to nine hours, when you start to draw below seven hours, there is a relationship, which suggests that the shorter your sleep, the shorter your life. Short sleep in that regard predicts all cause mortality. But it's again, not a linear relationship like the one that we've seen with REM sleep. Once you get past nine hours, the mortality curve stops going down. And then once you get further 10 or 11 hours, it hooks back up again, it's almost like a J shape, tilted over a little bit and reversed. So there's this strange hook, what's going on here? Right now, sleep science has at least two non mutually exclusive explanations for this. The first is that if you look at some of those populations, the idea is that the whatever was causing them illness and took their lives was just too much for sleep to deal with. However, we know that when we get sick, one of the things that we do immediately in this whole mechanism and inflammatory mechanisms cytokine mediated, when we get sick, we want to sleep more. We just want to curl up in bed and you know, sleep it off. So the argument there is that it's not that sleep was killing people prematurely, it was that these people were calling on this the help of sleep, they were calling on this thing called the Swiss Army Knife of health, that is sleep. But whatever it is that they were facing was just too powerful for sleep to overcome. So it artificially looks as though more sleep leads to a higher risk of death, when sleep is actually responding to the mortality risk, and it lost the battle. That's one argument. The second is that we know that sleep quality and poor sleep efficiency is a very strong predictor of all cause mortality. And when you look at people who often report sleeping longer amounts, 10 or 11 hours, they typically report having very poor quality sleep. So because their quality of sleep is poor, they just try to sleep longer to try and get some of that back. So again, here now it's poor quality sleep masking as too much sleep leading to this artificial hook which looks like mortality. That's the second explanation. A third which is more of a Gedanken, which is just the kind of like a thought experiment and I have this mentality, I don't know how many other people share this. I actually think that could be a thing as too much sleep. Physiologically, I think it's possible. But the reason I think that is because it's no different than food, water or oxygen. Can you overeat? Yes, you can. Can you under eat? Of course. - Or light. light in the early part of the day, throughout the day, wonderful. Light late in the day and at night, detrimental. - Bi-directional, you know, for water, can you over hydrate, hypernatremia it can lead, you know, it happened in the 1990s and 2000, with the ecstasy craze, where governments were saying you're dehydrating you're dancing all night, please drink water. And they drunk too much water, their blood electrolytes went you know, all over the place, and they were having cardiac arrests or stroke. - Yeah people were dying. - And they were dying because of excessive hydration. Can you get too much oxygen, hypoxemia? And it can cause free radical damage, which can be profoundly harmful and kill brain cells. Can you sleep too much? You know, which is the fifth element of the life equation, you know, alongside you know, food, water, oxygen, you know, so forth. I should say I can't even count. Clearly I'm sleeping well. Yes, I think that could be that possibility. Are most people in danger of getting too much sleep? Or contrary, if you look at the data. So but I don't dismiss that idea. I think it's possible. - That's a very thorough and very nuanced, and yet very clear answer. So I, it's so interesting to think that a lot of the data that's out there that talking about being in bed too long that it's just trying to compensate for the actual fragmentation of sleep. So what I'm coming away with is that there are many paths to this and both positive and things to avoid. But the idea is to get most nights, a similar amount, probably seven to nine hours, somewhere in there, of high quality sleep. That this notion of sleep quality is going to become, I would hope, a phrase that more people think about and learn about and cultivate as a practice. I want to ask about a set of behaviors that I'm at least I'm aware of at least one company is starting to track in their sleep monitoring device, and that's orgasm, and sex orgasm and masturbation topics that are, you know, are somewhat sensitive. But from the perspective of biology, right, none of us would be here were it not for sperm meets egg in some fashion, either in a dish or in vivo. But what are the data as you know them to be or maybe your lab is even doing this kind of work and exploration about the role that sex, orgasm, masturbation play in getting to sleep and staying asleep and sleep quality? Certainly those behaviors and those physiological events have been part of our evolutionary history. What's the story there? What can we say about this in terms of science and dare I say practice? - Yeah, I mean, it's almost that caricature of you know, in the movies where, you know, a couple makes love and then all of a sudden, you just sort of hear snoring or, you know, that happens with the idea that it somewhat some neurogenic that it's sleep promoting. - Well, the post orgasmic increase in prolactin. - Well, that's very, is interesting. - Is thought to be a set a naturally occurring sedative, that presumably has a function in. - And oxytocin has that also that benefit where you see, you know, a dissipation of the fight or flight branch of the nervous system, which has to happen for you to fall asleep. That's why we often see, you know, here at The Sleep Center, we'll see a phenomenon called wired and tired where people say, look, I am so desperately tired I just I'm so so tired, but I can't fall asleep, because I'm too wired. So your sleep drive, you're desperately tired, it's there but because you're wired, because you've got too much sympathetic activation, too much cortisol as well, you can't fall asleep. It's an impressive roadblock to anything like good sleep. And it's one of the principal mechanisms that we now believe stress and physiological activation, that is the underlying cause of many forms of insomnia. But coming back to sex, the data is actually quite compelling, that both either subjectively assessed sleep quality, or objective amount of sleep, sex that has resulted in orgasm, and I think it's that latter part that typically needs to happen. - I would imagine so. - That, you know, so between two mutually exclusive individuals, where both are, you know, beneficial in terms of receiving an orgasm. [cross talking] - Yeah, I would say any discussion about sex, we were referring to consensual, age appropriate, species appropriate, context appropriate. - Wow, I would never have even gone to the species appropriate. - I put species in there because it's the internet, and people will come up with all sorts of ideas. So I think that age appropriate, I think age appropriate, consensual, context appropriate and species appropriate, covers all the bases, but if I missed any, put them in the comment section, and we'll be sure to take note. - Yeah, no, I think that's really well said and important to say. So the data that is the when you look at couples who have orgasm. We've also, however, found benefits of masturbation, and it's not frequently spoken about. But what if you do some surveys, it turns out that people will often use masturbation as a sleep tool, if they're struggling with sleep. And I know, this sort of sounds almost like a strange conversation, or it's a taboo conversation but I think we just need to be very open about all of this. - I started off in science, one of the things I worked on early in my career, not the very first topic was the topic of early influences of hormones, estrogen and testosterone on sexual development of the brain and body. And when you are weaned in a laboratory like that, regardless of what era, you look at sex and its behaviors, and its hormones, and its physiologies as a scientist, and so that's to be clear what we're doing here, we're exploring these behaviors from that perspective. I mean, one thing is for certain, everyone is here because a sperm met an egg, either in a dish or in vivo, as we said before, and at least in 2021, there's no way around that fact. And what preceded that is typically this act we call sex and sometimes, hopefully, I like to think orgasm is associated with that sexual activity. Masturbation is one dimension of that is something that I think it can and should be discussed, if in fact, there are data that relate it to sleep. - Yeah, and both of those routes seem to lead to a sleep benefit. Now, I'm not saying that it's all about the orgasm. I think as we spoke about with oxytocin, there is some degree of par bonding that if you have a partner, and you experience you know, an intimate loving, you know, relationship that involves that, then you can have hormonal benefits that are sleep promoting, that may not necessarily be seen if you're just engaging you know, in the solo singular act of masturbation. So what we certainly know and I am not someone to take any advice on when it comes to anything relationship wise or sex wise. - That's a different episode of the podcast. - Yeah, yeah certainly. And that's not a podcast series that I'm going to be releasing anytime soon, it's going to be mostly about sleep. Although I will touch on, I'll release a podcast on sleep and sex. But that's the data that we have so far. We also know that it works both ways, though. And it's commonly the same way with sleep. You know, sleep and exercise, sleep and diet. How you eat can affect how you sleep, how you sleep can affect how you eat. Same with exercise. And it turns out, it's the same way with sexual behavior, too. So here, we're talking about whether sex can help with sleep. Can sleep help with your relationship and sex? And the answer is, yes, it can. Firstly, we know and we've spoken a little bit about this, that the reproductive hormones are under profound sleep regulation. - Both estrogen and testosterone, I understand. - Estrogen, testosterone, as I said. - Cause we hear so often about testosterone. But women who, or I should say anyone who's interested in having higher levels of estrogen or normal healthy levels of estrogen I presume the data show for estrogen what the data also show, similarly for testosterone. Which is if you get too little or poor quality of sleep both sex steroid hormones, as they're referred to testosterone and estrogen, which are present in both males and females and every variation thereof, are going to be diminished below normal healthy levels, correct? - Yes, estrogen, testosterone, FSH in women, a key hormone in the regulation for, key for conception, of course, all of these sex hormones seem to become significantly disrupted when sleep becomes of short quantity, or poor quality. We also know that in women, sleep disruption can usually lead to menstrual cycle disruption. We know this, particularly from evidence in shift working women where they are nighttime shift workers, they struggle with sleep during the day, often menstruation is disrupted or even becomes impaired. But we also know it works this way, not just for sex hormones, but for sex itself. For example, we found that for every one hour of sleep, extra sleep that a woman gets her interest in becoming sexually intimate with her partner increases by 14%, which is, you know, a non trivial amount. - Substantial. - And then the final part of I think this equation when it comes to sleep, and sex is your relationship itself. And there's some great work here from UC Berkeley by Professor Serena Chen. And what she found was that restless nights mean for far more brutal fights in your relationship. And they did this. - And vice versa. - A number of different elegant ways, and vice versa as well. - I mean, not that I've ever had conflict in relationships. [cross talking] - You know, just this is data I've read, I've never experienced that at all. So, they found reliably that sleep would predict higher likelihood of relationship conflict. Secondly, if you got into that conflict, the chances of you resolving it were significantly lower when the parties had not been sleeping well. Part of the reason is because when you are not well slept, your empathy goes down. So you're not, you're taking more of an abrasive stance with your partner, rather than a more agreeable stance with your partner. So at almost every dimension of a human loving relationship, sleep can have a dramatic impact. - I think these are really important things to underscore, one of the most common questions I get, because there seems to be community of people on the internet that are obsessed with this. I don't know who they are, because it's all, all this internet stuff is shouting into a tunnel and getting comments back in written form. It's a very bizarre conversation, so to speak. Is whether or not sexual behavior itself lowers or increases testosterone? And I went into the data, which spans many decades actually, both animal studies and human studies. And it seems just to underscore this as long as we're talking about this subject that it does seem that sexual activity, sex between two people does seem to increase testosterone in both. There is this question about orgasm or no orgasm ejaculation, no ejaculation and indeed, there do seem to be some effects of restricting ejaculation in males as a form of further increasing testosterone. So sex without ejaculation further increasing testosterone. But the data are not clean. Presumably because organizing these sorts of studies and getting truth in self reporting is probably hard to get from subjects. But everything sort of points in the direction that provided that the relationship is a healthy one, it's consensual, it's age appropriate, context appropriate, species appropriate that sex between two individuals does seem to increase the sex steroid hormones testosterone and estrogen toward healthy ranges. And what I'm hearing now this sort of Gestalt of the discussion we just had is that that too can promote sleepiness, restful states, and quality sleep. And I think this is an important conversation that just hasn't been held enough. I mean, sooner or later, both in the US and elsewhere, we're going to have to acknowledge that we are biological organisms of some sort, and that we have choice in life, about all these things, from supplementation to sex, or no sex, et cetera, but that they have profound effects on our core biology. I mean, it's fascinating to me that the areas of the hypothalamus, the preoptic area, the super optic areas, those areas which the names might not mean anything to anybody, besides Matt and I sitting here, but those areas sit cheek to jowl with each other in the hypothalamus and control, sleep and sex. The trigger of orgasm, the appetite for food, the appetite for water for electrolytes. I mean, the hypothalamus is kind of a festival of neurons with different booths for different primitive behaviors. - It's such a small, small structure in the brain, but it's the orchestrator of a vast number of our behaviors disproportionate in terms of its size versus effect. - Yeah, I don't think you can go to this hypothalamic festival without at least seeing all the booths whether or not you decide to visit them or not. - I love that master analogy. - So I'm glad that we've broached that conversation. And I hope people will think that we've approached it with the appropriate level of sensitivity. It's an important one that we're going to hear more about one way or the other. People are certainly thinking about this, if not engaging in these sorts of behaviors or avoiding them. So the more we can understand about the biology, the better. And so thank you for bringing that topic up. Because for the record, Matt, tabled it for discussion. - We were just like chatting outside and I think we said something about sort of sex, and I said we can go there. There is so much interesting data. - Absolutely, I want to touch on just two remaining topics. One is are there any unconventional sleep tips or things about sleep that we've overlooked? If we've covered everything great, but you know, we hear to keep the room cool. We hear because of this temperature phenomenon, the light aspects, the considerations about alcohol, CBD marijuana, cognitive behavioral, tart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps. - Please don't put me on the hook for tart cherries and kiwis, I was just offering what I know about the data. - And these are considerations and whether or not people batch these things, I won't even list them off now, because they're too many jokes that one could make. - And I have no affiliation with any of these products. [cross talking] - Well, I'm going to take out stock in a kiwi company. No I'm just kidding. But the question I have is about any unconventional or lesser known things, or maybe you do things or you think about things just in a purely exploratory way, as a scientist of that, you know, the what if kind of things that, yeah, what if it turns out that and I hear I just, I got a blank there for you to fill in. - I think, you know, beyond the standard, you know, fair that I've dished out plenty of times of sleep hygiene of you know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine, and we've spoken about all of those. What are some more unconventional tips, I guess? The first one, which is unconventional along the lines of naps. If you've had a bad night of sleep, let's say that you're starting to emerge with insomnia and you've had a bad night of sleep, the advice and I learned this from my wonderful colleague, Michael Perlis, do nothing. What I mean by that is, don't wake up any later, don't sleep in the following day to try and make up for it, don't nap during the day, don't consume extra caffeine to wake you up, to try to get you through the day, and don't go to bed any earlier to think that you're going to compensate. And I can explain all of those things. But if you wake up later, you're not going to be sleepy until late in the evening, so you're going to go to bed at your normal time and you won't be sleeping, you'll think well, I just came off a bad night of sleep. And now I still, I can't even get to sleep and it's my normal time. It's because you slept in later than you would otherwise, and you reduce the window of adenosine accumulation before your normal bedtime. So don't go, don't wake up any later. Don't use more caffeine for the reasons that are obvious, because that's only going to crank you and keep you awake the following night or decrease the probability of a good following night of recovery sleep. Third, I mentioned don't take naps, because once again, that will just take, you know, naps, particularly later in the afternoon, I almost liken them to snacking before a main meal, it just takes your appetite off the edge of that main meal of sleep, so don't do it. And then finally, don't go to bed any earlier, resist and resist and go to bed at your normal time. What I want to try and do is prevent you from thinking I had such a bad night last night and I normally go to bed at 10:30, I'm just going to get into bed at nine o'clock, because last night was just so bad. But that's not your natural bedtime, and it's not aligned with your natural chronotype because presumably you kind of know something about that, our morning time, evening time, you're trying to sleep in harmony, which is usually how you get best quality sleep. But you go to bed at nine, and my body is not ready to sleep at nine o'clock. But I'm worried because I had a bad night of sleep last night so I get into bed, and now I'm tossing and turning for the first hour and a half because it's not my natural sleep window, but I just thought it was a good idea. And if I didn't know anything about sleep, I would think all of these same things too. So I'm not finger wagging. But after if I have a bad night of sleep, and I am not immune, just because I know a little bit about sleep doesn't mean I don't have my bad nights, I do. Doesn't mean I haven't had bouts of insomnia in my life, I have. But after a bad night of sleep, I do nothing. I don't do any of those four things. I think the second tip I would offer in terms of unconventional is have a wind down routine. Many of us think of sleep as if it's like a light switch, that we just jump into bed, and when we turn the light out sleep should arrive in that same way. Just the binary you know it's on or it's off. Sleep is a physiological process, it's much more like landing a plane, it takes time to gradually descend down onto the terra firma of what we call good solid sleep at night. Find out whatever works for you and it could be light stretching, I usually meditate for about 10 or 15 minutes before bed. Some people like reading, try not to watch television in bed that's usually advised against. - Something that doesn't emit too much light to your eyes. - Too much light, too activating, you know, you can listen to relaxing podcasts, although we can speak about technology in the bedroom too. But have some kind of a wind down routine. It's you know, it's almost like you know, you wouldn't race into your garage and come to a screeching halt from 60 miles an hour, you typically down, shift your gears and you slow down as you come into the garage, that's the same thing with with sleep too. So that's the second thing, have some kind of a wind down routine, find what works for you. Maybe it's taking a hot bath or a warm shower, and then stick to it. Just we do this with kids all the time, we find out what their bedroom, sorry, their bedtime regiment is and then we just stick to it faithfully 'cause we humans are the same way too. The third thing is a myth, don't count sheep. There's a study done here at UC Berkeley, I didn't do this today, I wish I did, it's by my colleague, Professor Allison Harvey. And they found that counting sheep actually made it harder to fall asleep. It made matters worse. As a conter sorry counter measure to that what they did find was that taking yourself on some kind of a mental walk, so think about a nice walk that you take in nature or a walk on the beach, or even a walk around an urban environment. - Just visualizing that. - And visualizing that, that seemed to be beneficial. The other thing about sort of that idea of shifting focus away from your mind itself, get your mind off itself is a good piece of advice. Catharsis, you can try to write down all of the concerns that you have, and do this not right before bed, but usually an hour or two before bed. Some people call it a worry journal. And to me, it's a little bit like closing down all of the emotional tabs on my browser. Because if I shut the computer down and all of those tabs are still open, I'm going to come back in the morning, and the computer's red hot the fans going because it didn't go to sleep, because it couldn't because there were too many tabs active and open. I think it's the same way with sleep as well, so try to think about doing that. So just vomit out all of your concerns on the page. - I like that, cause my 3am waking is often associated with me writing down the list of things that I forgot to do that I need to do. And once I eventually wake up from the later night, second half of the night's sleep, that stuff seems much more tractable and reasonable, but it sure would be great to get that stuff out of the way before sleep. - Well, there's also something that I don't think people have spoken about a lot. And I'd like to research it, which is difficulty and anxiety at night in the dark, is not the same difficulty and anxiety in the light of day. And when we have those thoughts at night, it comes with a magnitude of rumination and catastrophization that is disproportionate to that which you would describe when you are awake. And I don't know what's going on about the brain, and thought and emotion at the time, I've got a bunch of theories as to why, and that's why I like the idea of closing up zipping up all of those different components, just get them out on the page. And it feel, and I at first thought this just sounds like who its it sounds very Berkeley, it's kind of Kumbaya, we all hold hands, and, you know, we all come at the end of the day. But then the data started coming out really good studies from good people. And they found that keeping one of those journals decreased the time it takes you to fall asleep by 50%, five, zero. - Amazing that's substantial. - That's well on par with any pharmaceutical agent. - I'm convinced that I've long thought that the worries and concerns and ideas I have at three, 4am I've learned to not place any stock in them. Because something, I'm glad that you might decide to eventually look at this in your laboratory because I feel like something is melted away or altered. I suspect it's in the regulation of the autonomic nervous system, that it makes sense why a concern at three, 4am ought to evoke more of a panic sense than a concern sense. And certainly, that's my experience, although not, fortunate to not suffer from full blown panic attacks. But everything seems worse at three, 4am provided you're awake. - And we need to sort of look into that because, you know, if you look at suicide rates, around the 24 hour clock face, disproportionately higher rates in those middle sort of night hours. So now, I don't know if that's causative or not, but something you know, it could just be that that's the time when we're mostly lonely, and we're by ourselves. And that's the reason. So it's got nothing to do with sleep or the night time, I don't know. So that's the third thing, I think the fourth sort of little tip I would give that's unconventional, is remove all clock faces from your bedroom. - Including your phone. - Including your phone, and resist checking it. Now I know and I can speak about the phone too that genie of technology is out the bottle. And it's not going back in anytime soon. So we've got to think a scientist and sleep scientist, you know, as to what we do with you know, phones in the bedroom. - Years ago, I was a counselor at a Summer camp I worked with at risk kids and there was a phrase that comes to mind here, it's be a channel, not a dam. Because when you try and dam certain kinds of behavior, physically dam certain kinds of behavior and not morally dam, that too, it just creeps over the edge, and you get a waterfall. So it has to be a channel. The phone and devices have to be worked with and negotiated not eliminated. - That's right and you know, think about those mindfully too but clock faces, remove all of those, because if you are having, you know, a tough night, knowing that it's 3:22 in the morning, or it's 4:48 in the morning, does not help you in the slightest. And it's only going to make matters worse than better. So try to remove all clock faces. And I think that's one of those other tips that some people have found helpful. But those would be sort of some slightly unconventional, I guess more than your stock fare of here are the five tips for sleep hygiene tonight, so. - Those are terrific sleep tips, and several of which, if not all of which I'm going to incorporate. Matt, this has been an amazing, deep dive on sleep and it's positive and negative regulators. - I hope it hasn't been too long. - No this has been great. - Please cut it down, shorten it to, you know, the five minutes of meaningful stuff that I offered. - Absolutely not, it is chock a block full of valuable takeaways. It's been tremendously fun for me to dissect out this incredible aspect of our lives that we call sleep with a fellow scientist and a fellow public educator. I want to say several things. First of all, we should say where people can find you although it shouldn't be that difficult these days. You're a very present on the internet. - [Matthew] Unfortunately. - For better or for worse. I think it's wonderful that you're out there. Look, it's a public health service that you're doing. No one requires you or any other scientist to get out and share this information. My sense of you knowing you a bit, and from following your work very closely both your scientific work in detail and your public facing educational work is that you very much want the best for people. And it's an interesting thing as a scientist or a clinician, to know that the that certain answers exist, that we don't have all the answers, but that there is a better path, there are better ways and people can benefit in a myriad of ways. So, for that, because I know that to be very genuine in you, you want the best for people and you're offering tremendous advice and considerations and people can take it or leave it that's the way I view it. I also want to thank you for taking the time out of your day to sit with me here and have this discussion. - Not at all, no at all, it's a privilege, it's a delight, you know, you and I, I think we're alike kind in lots of ways. And I take you as a shining example of how you can effectively connect with the public. And I know that we've had our conversations before we ever sat down to talk together about, you know, how to think about communicating with the public and the pros and cons of that. And I've just loved your opinions. I've been drinking it all in. And then I think the third thing I'd like to say is, thank you for being such an incredible sleep ambassador, the series that you've released on sleep, the way that you speak about sleep, the way that you moderate and have championed sleep. It is remarkable. So thank you for just being you know, a brother in arms in that way. - But we are and thanks for those those words. 99% of what I discussed there was the work of you and your colleagues in the sleep field. So proper acknowledgement, but thank you, where can people learn more about what you're doing currently? And what's coming next? You're on Twitter. - I am on Twitter I typically tweet. - As the sleep diplomat. - So, no it's just sleep diplomat - Sleep diplomat on Twitter. - Sleep diplomat on Twitter, sleepdiplomat.com website, if you want to learn more about the science that we do here, it's humansleepscience.com. It's the Center for Human Sleep Science. You can pick up a copy of the book, if you want. It's called \\\"Why We Sleep?\\\" if you're curious about sleep, that's one path to take and it's my view. - Is there another might someday in the future? - I think there may be, yeah. - Great, great, many, many millions of people will be very happy to hear that. - I think it's starting to take hold. And then as we discussed, I am more than kicking around the idea of a short form podcast rather than a long form, not long form, because I don't have the mental capacity or the interviewing, just capability that someone like you has. So it will probably just be monologue short form. So if there is some interest, I'll probably do that as well. So those are the ways that people can find me. But overall, if you're interested in sleep, just listen to Andrew. That's thing I can tell people. - All right, well now we're bating back and forth the vector of action so to speak, but I do hope you'll start a podcast however brief or lengthy these episodes turn out to be because I do believe that's a great venue to get information out into the world. And we don't just want to hear more from Matt Walker, I speak for many people, we need to, the work you're doing is both influential, but more importantly, it is important work. It has the impact that's needed, especially in this day and age where science and medicine, public health, and the issues of the world, etcetera, are really converging. So I know I speak on behalf of a tremendous number of people, when I just say thank you for doing the work you do and for being you. - [Matthew] Thank you. - And thanks for being a good friend. - Likewise, too and by the way, I'm just going to note that it was nice that the two of us both got the Johnny Cash memo about how to dress today. It seems as though we're both kind of we got that same memo, which will mean nothing to people who are listening, but if you're watching the video, you'll probably see what I mean. Andrew, thank you for taking this time. Thank you so much. - Thanks so much Matt. Thank you for joining me for my discussion with Dr. Matt Walker.

One issue in the supplement industry is that many supplements don't contain what's listed on the bottle. We therefore have partnered with Thorne, that's T H O R N E, Thorne supplements, because Thorne supplements have the highest levels of stringency in terms of the purity of the ingredients, and precision with respect to what's listed on the bottle is actually what's contained in those supplement bottles. If you'd like to see the supplements that I take for sleep, and for other things, you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman and there you'll see all the supplements that I take and can get 20% off any of those supplements as well as any other supplements that Thorne happens to make. That's Thorne, thorne.com/u/huberman. And last, but certainly not least, thank you for your interest in science.\",\n          \" Today is an Ask Me Anything episode or AMA. This is part of our premium subscriber channel. Our premium subscriber channel was started in order to provide support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast, which comes out every Monday and is available at 0 cost to everybody on all standard feeds, YouTube, Apple, Spotify and elsewhere.

And now without further ado, I will answer your questions. And as always, I will strive to be as thorough as possible, as clear as possible, and as concise as possible. Our first question is about abstaining from thoughts. And in answering this question, we're going to skirt right up against a topic that I've covered before on the podcast which is obsessive compulsive disorder, which is a very serious disorder. I mean, it can have a range of severity, but people with true OCD suffer a lot from obsessions, these are intrusive thoughts, and compulsions, which are the behaviors typically associated with those thoughts. I think it's really important that we define OCD really clearly so that we can make sure that we're talking about intrusive thoughts and the desire to abstain from thoughts versus OCD and where there might be some overlap there. The functional definition of OCD that really pertains to the disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, OCD as opposed to we call people neurotic, or we say you have OCD, or I'm so OCD about this, or OCD about that, that's become a common use of the acronym OCD. But true OCD is a situation in which engaging in a particular compulsive behavior does not serve to reduce the intensity or the frequency of the obsessions. In fact, it makes it worse. So the typical thing that we hear these days is oh, you're so OCD, or he's so OCD, or she's so OCD, or I'm so OCD. Now if someone is OCD in that sense, OK, so not the clinical disorder but OCD in the sense that they're really clean, they're really fastidious, they need everything perfect. However, that person can achieve some level of calm and comfort that's fairly long lasting if everything's clean and perfect, well, then that's not obsessive compulsive disorder. This is really important to understand as we venture into answering the question about intrusive thoughts and the desire to abstain from certain thoughts. A person with true OCD will keep cleaning and cleaning, or washing their hands, or arranging things at perfect right angles, but the more they do it, the more their anxiety goes up. A person who has more typical, gosh, we don't really even have a language for this nowadays unfortunately, but the sort of person that's extremely particular, they need things a certain way, and they're very driven to resolve things and do things to make sure that things are done in a certain way, or handled in a certain way, well, if that person can experience relief from engaging in let's say, exercise, or from cleaning, you'd say you're so OCD about exercise. Well, but if exercising for an hour or even two hours in the morning make somebody really calm the rest of the day and they don't need to exercise well, then they're not necessarily true OCD. They don't necessarily have a disorder related to exercise. However, if they're exercising for two hours in the morning and then they find they can't concentrate on other things and their desire to exercise just increases and increases and becomes intrusive for them disrupting their quality of life throughout the day, well, then that's falling under the umbrella of what we would call a true disorder. So we want to highlight that because the question is about a desire to abstain from thoughts, and the question is, in your discussion with Dr. Anna Lembke-- and I should just mention Dr. Anna Lembke is the director of our Dual Diagnosis Addiction Clinic at Stanford University School of Medicine. She's the author of this incredible book Dopamine Nation that I think everybody should read. I do believe everyone should read that book. So important for the addict and nonaddict alike because it deals with basically the state of our life nowadays. We're living in this dopamine rich world where we can quickly become dopamine depleted, which is terrible, leads to depression in addition to things like addiction in some folks, et cetera. Anna was a guest on the podcast. You can find her episode at hubermanlab.com. Just put Anna. I think she's the only guest we've had thus far whose name is Anna, so it'll just pop up there. The entire website is searchable. But if you want to listen to that episode or watch that episode, you can access it hubermanlab.com. The question is in your discussion with Dr. Anna Lembke you were talking about abstaining from people's drug of choice for 30 days to reset the dopamine reward pathway. And indeed that is the prescriptive that Dr. Anna Lembke gives for most all addictions and for people that are suffering from milder even severe depression related to dopamine seeking behaviors, social media, video games, sex, food, et cetera. However, of course, in the instance of food or in some other addictions, you can't abstain for 30 days. That would be terrible to abstain for food for 30 days. I'm sure people have done it, but it is not healthy to do. Certain things like alcohol and drugs people can abstain for 30 days in efforts to never go back to them again. There are cases of severe alcohol or opiate dependence where people can't go cold turkey or they risk dying, so there they need to really work with a physician. But the 30-day reset of the dopamine system is something that's very real and that pertains to most people. That is it's going to be very effective for most people struggling with either behavioral, or what are sometimes called process addictions, or other types of addictions including substance abuse issues. The question continues. You said you were going to ask Ana how to abstain if your drug of choice is a thought or narrative as opposed to a substance or a behavior. The question continues, as far as I can tell, your discussion with Ana moved on before you asked her the question. Would you be able to discuss strategies for abstaining from addictive thoughts and narratives? OK. So let's talk about intrusive thoughts, and let's start off by asking ourselves, what is a thought? In the realm of neurobiology, we have sensations which are the processes by which our neurons, nerve cells convert light, photons, sound waves, touch, mechanical pressure, et cetera into electrical signals and chemical signals that head into our nervous system, including our brain. And then our brain, at least we think, make sense of them, and help us navigate the world that we're in. So the sensation part is a pure transformation of mechanical information, or in some cases, chemical information like smell. Literally, volatile chemicals floating around in the world are brought in through your nose and your neurons and your olfactory bulb convert those into electrical and chemical signals that your brain can understand. Perceptions are your idea of what those signals out in the world are. Either because you're paying attention to them, or for some other reason you decide that stop sign in front of you is red, and that the sign behind it is white, and that the sky is blue or cloudy, those are perceptions. So we have sensations and perceptions. Then we have emotions which are these things that include the mind and body that are related to neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, et cetera, although, those chemicals do other things as well. And then, of course, we have behaviors, actions. Everything from me moving my pen on a piece of paper to walking, running, et cetera. Thoughts are a fifth category of neural functioning that we really need to define, but that doesn't have as strict a definition as sensations, perceptions, or feeling, or action. But thoughts are real. We all know this. Thoughts are real, and one way that we can define thoughts is that thoughts are perceptions that include data from the past, present, or future, or combinations of past and present, or present and future, or future and past. I'm not trying to give an overly complicated definition here, but if we are going to answer a question about how to abstain from thoughts in a really direct and actionable way, we really need to address what our thoughts. So thoughts are perceptions that are generated internally. We don't need any external sensation in order to have a thought. We can close our eyes. We could be in sensory isolation for that matter. We could even be floating with no gravity, and we can have a thought. Thoughts tend to run pretty much automatically in the background all the time. Some people refer to this as chatter in the back of our minds in a very unstructured way. And then if we force our thoughts to be structured because we decide they need to be, or if something in our environment captures our perception, then our thoughts tend to be structured. Let me give you an example. If I'm just walking around, if there were a way in which we could broadcast my thoughts onto a screen, I hope we wouldn't do that. But those thoughts would be a mixture of semi-complete sentences and gibberish. However if somebody stops me, and says, hi. Good to see you. What are you doing today? And I start answering, well, then my thoughts are suddenly being driven by an external stimulus, their question, and some internal ideas, memory of who I am and what I'm doing that day so past and present, and so on. And so thoughts become structured. So when we have a question about how to abstain from thoughts, we need to be additionally specific and really pinpoint that what we're trying to do is to abstain from thoughts we don't want presumably, either because they are too repetitive and distracting, or because what's contained in those thoughts is disturbing. This is important because it gives us two answers to the questions that are highly divergent. One answer to the question of how to abstain from intrusive thoughts, thoughts that were addicted to, is if those thoughts are merely on loop all the time and we can't stop them, but the thoughts themselves aren't particularly disturbing. So think about a song you can't get out of your head, or you keep recounting some event, but the event itself isn't very disturbing. It's just intrusive because it's there. Well, in that case, the data really point to trying to anchor your thoughts to some external stimulus. So getting into action, getting into activities that really draw your attention away from that thought. Now you may still hear it scrolling in the background, so you might be sitting in class still hearing that loop of thoughts in the background. That's something that over time ought to wane, it ought to disappear if we try and bring more and more attention to whatever it is that's in our environment, whatever it is that we happen to be learning or doing physically, et cetera. Things like mindful meditation. Doing a 10 or even just 5 minute a day practice of sitting with eyes closed, or lying down with eyes closed and really focusing on one's breath, focusing one's attention on sometimes called the third eye center, but in science we'd say just the region right behind the forehead, you're directing your attention there, has been shown to increase focus for singular topics and can improve memory and do a bunch of other things as well. Those are data from Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab at New York University. She was a guest on the podcast as well. My laboratory has run studies on mindful meditation as well. So what you're really trying to do is learn how to focus better on one thing, and by focusing on that one thing, you focus off these repetitive thoughts. Now, I have a feeling that this question was asked and that many people upvoted this question because the issue isn't just thoughts that are intrusive because they're there and on repeat, but because the thoughts themselves are actually troubling. This could be recounting a trauma, someone harmed you, you observed something that was disturbing, you felt wronged, you felt someone else was wronged, you can't seem to get your mind off of something, and your emotions tend to follow, and so it's uncomfortable. I have a feeling this is the root of the question. In that case, the approach is very different. What we know from essentially all of the quality scientific and clinical studies is that those sorts of intrusive thoughts are very much like a trauma. Now we have to be clear in defining what trauma is. I'll use the definition that Dr. Paul Conti, another incredible guest that was on our podcast. A Stanford-Harvard trained psychiatrist. I think one of the world's foremost leaders on the issue of trauma and psychiatry and psychology generally. He defines trauma as an event or something that fundamentally changes the way that your nervous system works such that you function less adaptively going forward from that event. So not every bad occurrence in your life is a trauma. That's good news. The bad news is many people have traumas, and traumas change the way that our nervous system works so that we don't function as well as we could. So in that sense, intrusive thoughts that are disturbing are in many ways traumas and are reinforcing that trauma. Now, we know that almost counterintuitively in order to deal with trauma, you have to get very close to that trauma. You don't have to reexpose, and I would hope you would not reexpose yourself to the very same trauma. But we know that one of the best ways to deal with traumas is to get very clear about the narrative around those traumas. Now this can be done with a therapist ideally, but not everyone has access to therapy or can afford therapy. There's a range of quality of therapists for that matter, so we're always referring to the desire for people to do great therapy with really great, meaning excellently trained people. But it turns out that if you want to extinguish an intrusive thought, one of the best ways to do that is to journal about that particular thought extensively. So rather than the earlier strategy for intrusive thoughts where they're just on loop, and intrusive because they're on loop and present, but their content isn't disturbing, when that thought is disturbing and intrusive, we know that it's very useful to script out as much detail about that particular thought and the things around it as possible. Now obviously, you want to do this in a way that is fairly structured. So you ideally would use complete sentences. So the reason for doing that is that thoughts, as I mentioned earlier, can often be fragmentary. So they pop up in our mind almost we seemingly spontaneously. They're inhibiting our ability to focus, or be present at work, or family, or other things, or sleep. Writing things down in a lot of detail does seem to have this quality of both reducing the emotional load of whatever it is that thought is about, as well as diminishing the frequency of those intrusive thoughts over time. So this is far and away different than the strategy I mentioned for the other types of intrusive thoughts. And really it's far and away different from the 30-day abstinence approach that Dr. Anna Lembke was talking about for substance or behavioral addictions. Now, of course, this process of abstaining from thoughts or removing the addictive nature of certain thoughts can definitely take some time. So a good example there would be superstitions. I'll come clean here, and I've talked about this before on a few podcasts that when I was in college, I developed a knock on wood superstition. Any time I'd say something that I didn't want to happen or did want to happen, I'd say, knock on wood, and I'd knock on wood. And then I started suppressing the behavior mostly because it was a little embarrassing. And then I started just telling myself in my head, knock on wood, knock on wood, knock on wood. And it was clearly a little bit of an OCD type thing, but again, OCD in air quotes here. I think it qualified as OCD in the sense that the more I did it, the more I wanted to do it. So I needed to go cold turkey on the thinking, but how can you go cold turkey on a thought? You couldn't. What I was told to do and what worked very well for me was to just write down the worst possible outcome that I was concerned about. So to really get close to the nature or the underlying basis of that intrusive thought. And I raise this because a lot of times the intrusive thought is not, OK, I'm thinking about a car accident, or I'm thinking about a breakup, or I'm thinking about an exam that I have. That can be intrusive, but a lot of times it's some kind of nebulous, abstract, set of words, or ideas, or images around something that happened that we saw or heard or experienced. And by putting a lot of clear structure to what the thought is exactly and to putting some thought and structure onto paper about what that pattern of not healthy thinking relates to, people often achieve tremendous relief in a fairly short amount of time. Sometimes just in one session of writing it down, sometimes they need to write it down multiple times. What you're essentially trying to do with a intrusive thought or a trauma of any kind is you're trying to turn a disturbing story, that is a story that evokes a lot of emotion and captures, it hijacks your nervous system, into what is essentially a known but repetitive and old, boring story where the emotional load has been depleted. And there are, of course, I have to highlight the fact that getting sufficient rapid eye movement sleep we also know is very important for removing the emotional load of traumatic experiences and intrusive thoughts. So you really want to strive to get the best possible sleep you can. That includes sufficient rapid eye movement sleep. And we have multiple zero-cost resources for that at hubermanlab.com. We have the episode on mastery or sleep. We have the episode on perfecting your sleep. We have the toolkit for sleep. All of which are time stamped and all of which can be accessed to completely zero cost to try and get your sleep as good as possible, including lots of rapid eye movement sleep. So in order to remove intrusive and addictive thoughts, ask yourself, is this OCD of the classic sense? If it is, you should see a psychiatrist. They won't necessarily prescribe medication, but there are tools for true OCD that are very effective in many cases. And we did the episode on OCD which I invite you to listen to as well. You want to ask yourself, are the thoughts disturbing or merely intrusive and repetitive? If they're merely intrusive and repetitive, well, then learning to focus your attention on other things and getting better at focusing on single things through an exercise like mindfulness, meditation can really help. And indeed perhaps the best use of mindfulness meditation is to improve your level of focus. It does have other benefits as well, but that's going to be the major one that one will experience even with these very short 5 or 10-minute day meditations. Great data on that from the scientific literature. And then if those intrusive thoughts are not only intrusive but they're also disturbing, in that case, you really want to put as much structure and thought, believe it or not, into what those thoughts are really about. Write them out on paper in complete sentences and maybe do that multiple times until the underlying emotions related to those thoughts really start to diminish. And by doing that, you're essentially doing your own form of trauma therapy, for lack of a better way to put it. And again, the data really point to the fact that getting close to the specific details around those intrusive thoughts is going to be the best way to extinguish them. Thank you for joining for the beginning of this Ask Me Anything episode. To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these Ask Me Anything sessions, plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the Huberman Lab podcast standard channel and premium tools not released anywhere else, please go to hubermanlabs.com/premium Just to remind you why we launched the Huberman Lab podcast Premium channel it's really twofold. First of all, it's to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel which, of course, will still be continued to be released every Monday in full length. We are not going to change the format or anything about the standard Huberman Lab podcast. And to fund research, in particular research done on human beings. So not animal models but on human beings, which I think we all agree is the species that we are most interested in. And we are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance. And those protocols will be distributed through all channels. Not just the premium channel but through all channels, Huberman Lab podcast and other media channels. So the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth, and allow you the opportunity to support the research that provides those kinds of answers in the first place. Now an especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the Tiny Foundation has generously offered to do a dollar-for-dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel. So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science-related tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. If you'd like to sign up for the Huberman Lab Premium channel, again there's a cost of $10 per month, or you can pay $100 up front for the entire year. That will give you access to all the AMAs, you can ask questions and get answers to your questions, and you'll, of course, get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well. There will also be some premium content such as transcripts of the AMAs and various transcripts and protocols of Huberman Lab podcast episodes not found elsewhere. And again, you'll be supporting research for mental health, physical health, and performance. You can sign up for the premium channel by going to hubermanlab.com/premium. Again, that's hubermanlab.com/premium. And as always, thank you for your interest in science. [MUSIC PLAYING]\",\n          \"ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a Professor of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is Dr. Lex Fridman Dr. Lex Fridman is an expert in electrical and computer engineering, artificial intelligence, and robotics. He is also the host of the Lex Fridman Podcast, which initially started as a podcast focus on technology and science of various kinds, including computer science and physics, but rapidly evolved to include guests and other topics as a matter of focus, including sport. For instance, Dr. Lex Freedman is a Black Belt in Brazilian jujitsu. And he's had numerous guests on who come from the fields of Brazilian jujitsu, both from the coaching side and from the competitor side. He also has shown an active interest in topics such as chess and essentially anything that involves intense activation and engagement of the mind and/or body. In fact, the Lex Fridman podcast has evolved to take on very difficult topics such as mental health-- he's had various psychiatrists and other guests on that relate to mental health and mental illness, as well as guest focused on geopolitics and some of the more controversial issues that face our times. He's had comedians, he's had scientists, he's had friends, he's had enemies on his podcast. Lex has a phenomenal, I would say a 1 in an eight billion ability to find these people, make them comfortable, and in that comfort, both try to understand them and to confront them and to push them so that we all learn. All of which is to say that Lex Fridman is no longer just an accomplished scientist, he certainly is that. But he has also become one of the more preeminent thought leaders on the planet. And if there's anything that really captures the essence of Lex Fridman, it's his love of learning, his desire to share with us, the human experience, and to broaden that experience so that we all may benefit. In many ways, our discussion during today's episode captures the many facets of Lex Fridman, although no conversation, of course, could capture them all. We sit down to the conversation just days after Lex returned from Ukraine, where he deliberately placed himself into the tension of that environment in order to understand the geopolitics of the region and to understand exactly what was happening at the level of the ground and the people there. You may notice that he carries quite a lot of both, emotion and knowledge and understanding. And yet in a very classic Lex Fridman way, you'll notice that he's able to zoom out of his own experience around any number of different topics and view them through a variety of lenses so that first of all, everyone feel included, but most of all, so that everyone learned something new, that is to gain new perspective. Our discussion also ventures into the waters of social media and how that landscape is changing the way that science and technology are communicated. We also get into the topics of motivation drive and purpose, both finding it and executing on that drive and purpose. I should mention that this is episode 100 of the Huberman Lab Podcast. And I would be remiss if I did not tell you that there would be no Huberman Lab Podcast, were it not for Lex Fridman. I was a fan of the Lex Fridman Podcast long before I was ever invited on to the podcast as a guest. And after our first recording, Lex was the one that suggested that I start a podcast. He only gave me two pieces of advice. The first piece of advice was, start a podcast. And the second piece of advice was that I not just make it me blabbing into the microphone and staring at the camera. So I can safely say that I at least followed half of his advice, and that I am ever grateful for Lex, both as a friend, a colleague in science, and now fellow podcaster for making the suggestion that we start this podcast. I already mentioned a few of the topics covered on today's podcast. But I can assure you that there is far more to the person that many of us know as Lex Fridman. If you are somebody interested in artificial intelligence, engineering, or robotics, today's discussion is most certainly for you. And if you are not, but you are somebody who is interested in world politics, and more importantly, the human experience, both the individual and the collective human experience, Lex shares what can only be described as incredible insights into what he views as the human experience and what is optimal in order to derive from our time on this planet. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is LMNT. LMNT is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you don't. That means the electrolytes, sodium, potassium, and magnesium are in LMNT in the correct ratios. But it has no sugar. As I mentioned before on the podcast, electrolytes are critical to the function of every cell in the body, and especially the cells in your brain, meaning neurons or nerve cells. Indeed, the ability for nerve cells to be active and communicate with one another critically depends on sodium, potassium, and magnesium. You can get electrolytes from a variety of sources. But it's often hard to get them in the proper ratios, even from food. So if you're somebody who's exercising a lot and sweating, or if you're somebody following, for instance, a low carbohydrate or even a semi-low carbohydrate diet, that will cause you to excrete electrolytes. I tend to have my LMNT first thing in the morning when I wake up or within the first few hours of waking, any time while or after I'm exercising, or I've sweat a lot, such as exiting the sauna. If you'd like to try LMNT you can go to drinkLMNT-- that's LMNT..com/Huberman to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase. Again, that's drinkLMNT, LMNT.com/Huberman to my free sample pack. Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels. Levels is a program that lets you see how different foods affect your health by giving you real-time feedback on your diet using a continuous glucose monitor. Now blood glucose or blood sugar is a critical aspect of your immediate and long term health, and indeed, your feelings of vigor and mental clarity and well-being at any moment. One of the key things is to know how different foods and food combinations and timing of food intake is impacting blood glucose. And with Levels, you're able to assess all of that in real time. I tried Levels. And what it taught me, for instance, was that I can eat certain foods at certain times of day. But if I eat them at other times a day, I get a blood sugar crash. It also taught me, for instance, how to space my exercise and my food intake. It turns out for me, exercising fasted is far more beneficial. That's something I learned using Levels. And it's completely transformed, not just the spacing and timing of my diet and exercise, but also use of things like the sauna and other activities. It's been a tremendous learning for me that's really shaped an enormous number of factors in my life that have led to me feeling far more vigorous with far more mental focus and physical strength and endurance. So if you're interested in learning more about Levels and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself, go to levels.link/Huberman. Again that's levels.link, L-I-N-K/Huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep. Eight Sleep make smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity. I've talked many times on this podcast about the critical relationship between sleep and body temperature. That is in order to fall asleep and stay deeply asleep throughout the night, our body temperature needs to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees. And conversely when we wake up in the morning, that is in large part, because of our body heating up by 1 to 3 degrees. Now people have different core body temperatures. And they tend to run colder or hotter throughout the night. Eight Sleep allows you to adjust the temperature of your sleeping environment so that you have the optimal temperature that gets you the best night's sleep. I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover about eight months ago. And it has completely transformed my sleep. I sleep so much deeper, I wake up far less during the middle of the night, if at all, and I wake up feeling far better than I ever have, even after the same amount of sleep. If you want to try Eight Sleep, you can go to eightsleep.com/Huberman to save up to $400 off their sleep fit holiday bundle, which includes their new Pod 3 cover. Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, United Kingdom, select countries in the EU, and Australia. Again, that's eightsleep.com/Huberman. And now for my discussion with Dr. Lex Fridman, welcome back. LEX FRIDMAN: It's good to be back in a bedroom. This feels like a porn set. I apologize to open that way. I've never been in a porn set, so I should admit this. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Our studio has being renovated. So here we are for the monumental recording of episode 100-- LEX FRIDMAN: Episode 100 of the Huberman Lab Podcast, which was inspired by the Lex Fridman Podcast. Some people already know the story. But I'll repeat it again for those that don't. There would not be a Huberman Lab Podcast, were it not for Lex Fridman. Because after recording as a guest on his podcast a few years ago, he made the suggestion that I start a podcast. And he explained to me how it works. And he said, \\\"You should start a podcast. But just make sure that it's not you blabbing the whole time, Andrew.\\\" And I only sort of followed the advice. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, well, you surprised me, surprised the world, that you're able to talk for hours and cite some of the best science going on and be able to give people advice without many interruptions or edits or any of that. I mean, that takes an incredible amount of skill that you're probably born with. And some of it is developed. I mean, the whole science community is proud of you, man. Stanford is proud of you. So yeah, it's a beautiful thing. It was really surprising. Because it's unclear how a scientist can do a great podcast that's not just shooting the shit about random stuff, but really is giving very structured, good advice that's boiling down the state of the art science into something that's actually useful for people. So that was impressive. It's like holy shit, he actually pulled this off. And doing it every week on a different topic-- I mean, I'm usually positive, especially for people I love and support. But damn, I thought, there's no way he's going to be able to pull this off week after week. And it's been only getting better and better and better. Had a whole rant on a recent podcast, I forget with who, of how awesome you are with Rana el Kaliouby. She's a emotion recognition person, AI person. And then she didn't know who you were. And I was like, what the hell do you mean? And I just went on this whole rant of how awesome you are. Is hilarious. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I'm very gratified to hear this. I'm-- it's a little uncomfortable for me to hear but listen, I'm just really happy if people are getting information that they like and can make actionable. And it was inspired by you. And look right back at you. I've followed a number of your structural formats. Attire, I don't wear a tie. I'm constantly reminded about this by my father. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Who says what-- he'd saw my podcast. And he was like, why don't you dress properly like your friend Lex? He literally said that. And it's a debate that goes back and forth. But nonetheless-- LEX FRIDMAN: How does it feel? Episode 100. How does it feel? ANDREW HUBERMAN: You know, I think. LEX FRIDMAN: Can you imagine you're here? You hear after so many episodes and done so much. I mean, the number of hours is just insane. The amount of passion, the amount of work you put into this, what's it feel like? ANDREW HUBERMAN: It feels great. And it feels very much like the horizon is still at the same distance in front of me. Every episode, I just try and get information there. And the process that we talked about on your podcast. We won't go into it of collecting information, distilling it down to some simple notes, walking around, listening to music, trying to figure out what the motifs are, and then-- as just like you, I don't use a teleprompter or anything like that. There's very minimal notes. So it feels great, and I love it. And again, I'm just grateful to you for inspiring it. And I just want to keep going and do more of it. And I should say I am also relieved that we're sitting here because you recently went overseas to a very intense war zone, literally, the Ukraine. And the entire time that you were there, I was genuinely concerned. The world's a unpredictable place, in general. And we don't always get the only vote and what happens to us. So first of all, welcome back safely, one peace, one alive peace. And what was that like? I mean, at a broad level, at a specific level, what drew you there? What surprised you? And how do you think it changed you in coming back here? LEX FRIDMAN: I think there's a lot to say. But first, it is really good to be back. One of the things that when you go to a difficult part of the world or a part of the world that's going through something difficult, you really appreciate how great it is to be an American. Everything. The easy access to food. Despite what people think, the stable, reliable rule of law. The lack of corruption in that you can trust that if you start a business or if you take on various pursuits in life that there's not going to be at-scale manipulation of your efforts such that you can't succeed. So this kind of capitalism is in it's-- the ideal of capitalism is really still burning bright in this country. And it really makes you appreciate those aspects. And also just the ability to have a home for generations, across generations. So you can have your grandfather live in Kentucky in a certain city. And then his children lived there, and you live there, and then it just continues on and on. That's the kind of thing you can have when you don't have war. Because war destroys entire communities. And it destroys histories, generations, like life stories that stretch across the generations. So-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah yeah. I didn't even think about that until you said just now. But photographs, hard drives get destroyed or just abandoned. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Libraries. I mean, nowadays, things exist in the cloud but are still a lot of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --material goods that are irreplaceable, right. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, even in rural parts of the United States, they don't exist in the cloud, right. A lot of people still, well, even in towns, they still love the physical photo album of your family. A lot of people still store their photographs of families in the VHS tapes and all that kind of stuff, yeah. But I think-- there's so many things I've learned and really felt the lessons. One of which is nobody gives a damn when your photos are gone and all that kind of stuff, your house is gone. The thing time and time again I saw for people that lost everything is how happy they are for the people. They love the friends, the family that are still alive. That's the only thing they talk about. That, in fact, they don't mention actually with much dramatic sort of vigor about the trauma of losing your home. They're just non-stop saying how lucky they are that person X person Y is still here. And that makes you realize that when you lose everything, it's still-- it makes you realize what really matters, which is the people in your life. I mean, a lot of people kind of realize that later in life, when you're facing mortality, when you're facing your death, or you get a cancer diagnosis, that kind of stuff. I think people here in America, in California, with the fires, you you can still lose your home. You are going to realize, like, nah. It doesn't really matter. It's a pain in the ass but what matters is still the family, the people, and so on. I think the most intense thing-- I talked to several hundred people, some of which is recorded. I've really been struggling to put that out because I have to edit it myself. And so you're talking about 30, 40 hours of footage, and it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is emotionally struggling? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. It is extremely difficult. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Are you like emotional struggle? LEX FRIDMAN: It's extremely difficult. So I talked to a lot of politicians. The number two in the country, number three. I'll be back there to talk to the president to do a three-hour conversation. Those are easy to edit. They're really heartfelt and thoughtful folks from different perspectives on the geopolitics of the war. But the ones that really hard to edit is like grandmas that are in the middle of nowhere. They lost everything. They still have hope, they still have love. And some of them have-- some of them, many of them, unfortunately, have now hate in their heart. So in February, when Russia invaded Ukraine, this is the thing I realized about War. One of the most painful one lessons is that war creates generational hate. We sometimes think about war as a thing that kills people, kills civilians, kills soldiers, takes away lives, injures people. But we don't directly think about the secondary and tertiary effects of that which lasts decades. Which is anyone who's lost the father or a mother or a daughter or a son, they now hate not just the individual soldiers or the leaders that invaded their country but the entirety of the people. So it's not that they hate Vladimir Putin or hate the Russian military. They hate Russian people. So that tears the fabric of a thing that, for me-- my half my family's from Ukraine, half of my family is from Russia. But there is-- I remember the pain the triumph of World War two still resonates through my entire family tree. And so, you remember when the Russians and Ukrainians fought together against this Nazi invasion. You remember a lot of that. And now, to see the fabric of this peoples torn apart completely with hate is really, really difficult. For me, just to realize that things will just never be the same on this particular cultural, historical aspect. But also, there's so many painful ways in which things will never be the same. Which is we've seen that it's possible to have a major hot war in the 21st century. I think a lot of people are watching this. China is watching this. India is watching this. United States is watching this and thinking we can actually have a large-scale war. And I think the lessons learned from that. Might be the kind that lead to a major World War III in the 21st century. So one of the things I realized watching the whole scene is that we don't know shit about what's going to happen in the 21st century. And it might-- we kind of have this intuition like surely there's not going to be another war. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like we'll just coast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, pandemic. Yeah-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: And back to normal. LEX FRIDMAN: Back to normal-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Whatever that is. LEX FRIDMAN: But you have to remember, at the end of World War I, as Woodrow Wilson called it, the war to end all wars. Nobody ironically, in a dark way, it was also the roaring 20s when people believed this. There will never be another World War. And 20 years after that, the rise of Nazi Germany. A charismatic leader that captivated the minds of millions and built up a military that can take on the whole world. And so it makes you realize that this is still possible. This is still possible. And then the tension. You see this-- the media machine, the propaganda machine, that I've gotten to see every aspect of. It's still fueling that division between America and China. Between Russia and India. And then Africa has a complicated thing that's trying to figure out who are they with, who are they against. And just this tension is building and building. And like it makes you realize like we might-- the thing that might shake human civilization may not be so far off. That's a realization you get to really feel. I mean, there's all kinds of other lessons. And one of which is propaganda. Is I got to-- I get a lot of letters, emails. And some of them are full of really intense language, full of hate from every side toward me. Or, well, the hate is towards me as representing side X. And X stands as a variable for every side. So either I'm a Zelensky show, or I'm a Putin show, or I'm a NATO show, or I'm an America-- America show-- American empire show. Or I'm a Democrat or a Republican. Because it's already been, in this country, politicized. I think there's a sense of Ukraine is this place that's full of corruption. Why are we sending money there? I think that's kind of the messaging on the Republican side. On the Democratic side-- I'm not even keeping track of the actual messaging and the conspiracy theories and the narratives, but they are-- the tension is there. And I get to feel it directly. And what you get to really experience is there's a large number of narratives that all are extremely confident themselves that they know the truth. People are convinced, first of all, that they're not being lied to. People in Russia think there's no propaganda. They think that, yes, yes, there is like state-sponsored propaganda, but we're all smart enough to ignore the lame propaganda that's everywhere. They know that we can think on our own, we know the truth, and everybody kind of speaks in this way. Everybody in the United States says, well, yes, there's mainstream media, they're full of messaging and propaganda, but we're smart. We can think on our own. Of course, we see through that. Everybody says this. And then the conclusion of their thought is often hatred towards some group, whatever that group is. And the more you've lost, the more intense the feeling of hatred. It's a really difficult field to walk through calmly and with an open mind and try to understand what's really going on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's super intense. That's the only words that come to mind as I hear this. You mentioned something that it seems that hate generalizes. It's against an entire group or an entire country. Why do you think it is that hate generalizes and that love may or may not generalize? LEX FRIDMAN: I've had-- sort of one, as you can imagine, the kind of question I asked is, do you have love or hate in your heart? It's a question I asked almost everybody. And then I would dig into this exact question that you're asking. I think some of the most beautiful things I've heard which is people that are full of hate are able to self-introspect about it. They know they shouldn't feel it, but they can't help it. It's not-- they know that ultimately the thing that helps them and helps everyone is to feel love for fellow man, but they can't help it. They know. It's like a drug, they say like hate escalates, it's like a vicious spiral. You just can't help it. And the question I also asked is, do you think you'll ever be able to forgive Russia? And after much thought almost-- it's split, but most people will say no. I will never be able to forgive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And because of the generalization you talked about earlier, that could even include all Ru-- LEX FRIDMAN: All Russians. ANDREW HUBERMAN: In that statements, they mean all Russians. LEX FRIDMAN: Because if you do nothing that's as bad or worse than being part of the army that invades. So the people that are just sitting there, the good Germans, the people that are just quietly going on with their lives, you're just as bad, if not worse, is their perspective. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Earlier, you said that going over to the Ukraine now allowed you to realize just so many of the positives of being here in the United States. I have a good friend. We both know him. I won't name him by name, but we've communicated the three of us from tier-one Special Operations. He spent years doing deployments. Really amazing individual. And I remember when the pandemic hit, he said on a text thread you know, Americans aren't used to the government interfering with their plans. Around the world, many people are familiar with governments dramatically interfering with their plans. Sometimes even in a seemingly random way. Here we were not braced for that. I mean, we get speeding tickets, and there's lines to vote and things like that. But I think the pandemic was one of the first times, at least in my life, that I can remember where it really seemed like the government was impeding what people naturally wanted to do. And that was a shock for people here. And I have a what might seem like a somewhat mundane question, but it's something that I saw on social media. A lot of people were asking me to ask you, and I was curious about too. What was a typical day like over there? Were sleeping in a bed, were you sleeping on the ground? Everyone seems to want to know. What were you eating? Were you eating once a day? Were you eating your steak? Or were you-- were you in fairly deprived conditions over there? I saw a couple photos that you posted out of doors in front of rubble. With pith helmet on in one case. What was that typical day like over there? LEX FRIDMAN: So there's two modes. One of them-- I spent a lot of time in Kyiv, which is much safer than-- it may be obvious to state but for people who don't know, it's in the middle of the country, and it's much safer than the actual front. The word the battle is happening. So much, much safer than Kyiv even is Lviv which is the Western part of the country. So the times I spent in Kyiv were fundamentally different than the time I spent at the front. And I went to the Kherson region, which is where a lot of really heated battle was happening. There's several areas. So there's Kharkiv. It's in the Northeast of the country. And then there's Donbas region, which is East of the country. And then there's Kherson region, which, by the way, I'm not good at geography, so is the Southeast of the country. And that's where, at least when I was there, was a lot of really heated fighting happening. So when I was in the Kherson region, it's what you would imagine. The place-- I stayed in a hotel where all the lights have to stay off. So the entire town, all the lights are off. You have to navigate through the darkness and use your phone to shine, and so on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: This is terrible for the circadian system. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: That's exactly-- I was this-- how can I do this? Where's my element and Athletic Greens? How can I function? No. There's I think it was balanced by the deep appreciation of being alive. [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right now I-- mean, this is the reason that I asked-- LEX FRIDMAN: Stress-wise. ANDREW HUBERMAN: This is the reason I ask is we get used to all these creature comforts. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And we don't need them, but we often come to depend on them in a way that makes us feel like we need them. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, but very quickly, there's something about the intensity of life that you see in people's eyes because they're living through a war that makes you forget all those creature comforts. And it was actually-- I'm somebody who hates traveling and so on. I love the creature habits. I love-- I love the comfort of the ritual right but all of that was forgotten very quickly. Just the intensity of feeling, the intensity of love that people have for each other, that was obvious. In terms of food-- so there's a curfew. So depends on what part of the country. But usually, you basically have to scamper home like 9:00 PM. So the hard curfew in a lot of places is 11:00 PM at night. But by then, you have to be home. So-- in some places, it's 10:00. So at 9:00 PM, you start going home. Which, for me, was kind of wonderful also because I get to spend-- I get to be forced to spend time alone and think for many hours in wherever I'm staying. Which is really nice. And everywhere there's a calmness and the quietness to the whole thing. In terms of food, once a day. Just the food is incredibly cheap and incredibly delicious. People are still-- one of the things they can still take pride in is making the best possible food they can. So meat-- but they do admire American meat, so the meat is not as great as it could be in that country. But I ate borsch every day, all that kind of stuff. Mostly meat. So spend the entire day-- wake up in the morning with coffee, spend the entire day talking to people. Which for me is very difficult because of the intensity of the story. It's one after the other after the other. We just talk to regular people, talk to soldiers, talk to politicians, all kinds of soldiers. I talked to people there who are doing rescue missions, so Americans. I hung out with Tim Kennedy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah? The great Tim Kennedy. LEX FRIDMAN: The great Tim Kennedy, who-- also him and many others revealed to me one of the many reasons I'm proud to be an American is how trained and skilled and effective American soldiers are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I guess for listeners of this podcast maybe we should familiarize them with who Tim Kennedy is because I realized that a number of them will know, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: How do you do that? How do you try to summarize a man? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. We can be accurate but not exhaustive, as any good data are accurate but not exhaustive. Very skilled and accomplished MMA fighter, very skilled and accomplished former Special Operations member, American Patriot, and podcaster too, right? Does he have his own podcast? LEX FRIDMAN: Maybe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. LEX FRIDMAN: Maybe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We know Andy Stumpf has his own podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: Which is an amazing podcast. Yeah, Andy's great. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Clearing Hot podcast with Andy Stumpf. LEX FRIDMAN: But also Tim Kennedy is like the embodiment of America to the most beautiful and the most ridiculous degree. So he's like what you imagine-- what is it, Team America? I just imagine him shirtless on a tank rolling into enemy territory just screaming at the top of his lungs. That's just his personality. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But not posturing. He actually does the work, as they say. LEX FRIDMAN: So this is the thing. He really embodies that. Now, some of that is just his personality and humor. I'd like to sort of comment on the humor of things, not just with him. There's very one other interesting thing I've learned. But also when he's actually helping people he's extremely good at what he does, which is building teams that rescue, that go into the most dangerous areas of Ukraine, dangerous areas anywhere else, and they get the job done. And one of the things I heard time and time again, which what's really interesting to me, that Ukrainian soldiers said that comparing Ukrainian, Russian, and American soldiers, American soldiers are the bravest, which was very interesting for me to hear given how high the morale is for the Ukrainian soldiers. But that just reveals that training enables you to be brave. So it's not just about how well trained they are and so on, it's how intense and ferocious they are in the fighting. And it makes you realize, this is American army, not just through the technology, especially the special force guys. They're still one of the most effective and terrifying armies in the world. And listen, just for context, I'm somebody who is, for the most part, anti-war, a pacifist. But you get to see some of the realities of war kind of wake you up to what needs to get done to protect sovereignty, to protect some of the values, to protect civilians and homes and all that kind of stuff. Sometimes war has to happen. And I should also mention the Russian side because while I haven't gotten to experience the Russian side yet I do fully plan to travel to Russia, as I've told everybody. I was very upfront with everybody about this. I would like to hear the story of Russians. But I do know from the Ukrainian side, like the grandmas-- I love grandmas. They told me stories that the Russians really-- the ones that entered their villages, they really, really believed they're saving Ukraine from Nazis, from Nazi occupation. So they feel that Ukraine is under control of Nazi organizations and they believe they're saving the country that's their brothers and sisters. I think propaganda and I think truth is a very difficult thing to arrive with in that war zone. I think in the 21st century one of the things you realize that so much of war, even more so than in the past, is an information war. And people that just use Twitter for their source of information might be surprised to know how much misinformation there is on Twitter, like real narratives being sold, and so it's really hard to know who to believe. And through all of that you have to try to keep an open mind and ultimately ignore the powerful and listen to actual citizens, actual people. That's the other maybe obvious lesson is that war is waged by powerful, rich people, and it's the poor people that suffer. And that's just visible time and time again. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You mentioned the fact that people still enjoy food or the pleasure of cooking, or there's occasional humor or maybe frequent humor. I know Jocko Willink has talked about this in warfare in that all the elements of the human spirit and condition still emerge at various times. I find this amazing, and you and I have had conversations about this before, but the aperture of the mind. The classic story that comes to mind is the one of Viktor Frankl or Nelson Mandela. You put somebody into a small box of confinement and some people break under those conditions and other people find entire stories within a centimeter of concrete that can occupy them, real stories and richness or humor or love or fascination and surprise. And I find this so interesting that the mind is so adaptable. We talked about creature comforts and then lack of creature comforts and the way that we can adapt, and yet, humans are always striving, it seems, or one would hope, for these better conditions to better their conditions. So as you've come back-- and you've been here now back in the States for how long after your trip? LEX FRIDMAN: Depends on this podcast release but it felt like I've never left, so practically speaking, a couple months. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Yeah. And we won't be shy. We're recording this mid-September. LEX FRIDMAN: We actually recorded this several years ago so we're anticipating in the future. ANDREW HUBERMAN: This is where we're going to start telling you this is a simulation, you and Joe. I'm still trying to figure out what that actually means. I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called AG1, is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens, once or usually twice a day, is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut is very important. It's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain, the immune system, and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health, and those probiotics in Athletic Greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health. In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met, and it tastes great. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman and they'll give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera, and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3, K2. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman to get the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin D3, K2. I know I speak for many people when I say that we are very happy that you're back. We know that it's not going to be the first and last trip, that there will be others, and that you'll be going to Russia as well and presumably other places as well in order to explore. And I have to say, as a podcaster and as your friend, I was really inspired at your sense of adventure and your sense of not just adventure, but thoughtful, respectful adventure. You understood what you were doing. You weren't just going there to get some wartime footage or something. This wasn't a kick or a thrill. This is really serious and remains serious. So thank you for doing it, and please, next time you go, bring Tim Kennedy again. LEX FRIDMAN: I feel like Tim Kennedy gets you into-- will take you because he really loves going to the most dangerous places and helping people. So I think he'd get me into more trouble than it's worth. And I should mention that, I mean, there's many reasons I went, but it's definitely not something I take lightly or want to do again. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. LEX FRIDMAN: So I'm doing things that I don't want to do, I just feel like I have to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You're compelled. LEX FRIDMAN: So I don't think there's-- now I'll definitely talk about it, as we all should. There's different areas of the world that are seeing a lot of suffering. Yemen. There's so many atrocities going on in the world today, but this one is just personal to me so I want to-- I feel like I'm qualified just because of the language. So most of the talking, by the way, I was doing, it was in Russian. And so because of the language, because of my history, I felt like I had to do this particular thing. I think it's, in many ways, stupid and dangerous, and that was made clear to me. But I do many things of this nature because the heart pulls towards that. But also there's a freedom to not-- I'm afraid of death, but I think there's a freedom to-- it's almost like, OK, if I die, I want to take full advantage of not having a family currently. I feel like when you have a family there's a responsibility for others so you immediately become more conservative and careful. I feel like I want to take full advantage of this particular moment in my life when you can be a little bit more accepting of risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, you should definitely reproduce at some point. Maybe before next time you should just freeze some sperm. LEX FRIDMAN: I-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Really, that-- LEX FRIDMAN: Is that what you do with ice baths? Is how that works? ANDREW HUBERMAN: You know, it's interesting. There's always an opportunity to do some science protocols. You know that there are products on the internet, and there are actually a few decent manuscripts looking at how cold exposure can increase testosterone levels, but it doesn't happen by the cold directly. Good scientists, as the authors of those papers, were and are, realized that it's the vasoconstriction and then the vasodilation. As people warm up again there's increased blood flow to the testicles, and in women it seems there's probably increased blood flow to the reproductive organs as well after people warm back up. So that seems to cause some sort of hyper nourishment of the various cells, the Sertoli and Leydig cells of the testes that lead to increased output of testosterone and in women testosterone as well. So the cold exposure in any case is obviously a-- do you do the ice bath? Are you into that? LEX FRIDMAN: I've not done that yet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: As a Russian you probably consider that a hot tub. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. It's a nice thing to have fun with every once in a while to warm up. No, I haven't done that. Been kind of waiting to maybe do it together with you at some point. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. LEX FRIDMAN: Because we have a guide. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We have one here. It'll be straightforward for you. I always say that the adrenaline comes in waves, and so if you just think about it walls, like you're going through a number of walls of adrenaline as opposed to going for time, it becomes rather trivial. With your jujitsu background and what you'll immediately recognize the physiological sensation. Even though it's cold specifically, it's the adrenaline that makes you want to hop out of the thing. LEX FRIDMAN: And you've seen Joe's. So Joe set up a really nice man cave-- or it's not even a cave because it's so big. It's like a network of man caves. But it has a ice bath and a sauna next to each other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We have one of those here, ice bath and sauna. So we'll have to get you in it one of these days. LEX FRIDMAN: Sounds like trouble. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow. No, although there is a-- I don't know the underlying physiological basis but there does seem to be a trend toward truth telling in the sauna. Some people will refer to them as truth barrels. Mine's a barrel sauna shaped like a barrel. Who knows why? Maybe under intense heat duress people just feel compelled to share. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, I have a complicated relationship with saunas because of all the weight cutting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. LEX FRIDMAN: Some of the deepest suffering-- sorry to interrupt-- I've done was in the sauna. It's very-- I mean, I've gone to some dark places in a sauna because, I mean, I wrestled my whole life, judo, jujitsu, and those weights cuts can really test the mind. So you're-- truth telling. Yeah, it's a certain kind of truth telling because you're sitting there and the clock moves slower than it has ever moved in your life. Yeah. So I usually, for the most part, I would try to have a bunch of sweats, garbage bags, and all that kind of stuff, and run. It's easier because you can distract the mind. In the sauna you can't distract the mind. It's just and all the excuses and all the weaknesses in your mind just coming to the surface, and you're just sitting there and sweating-- or not sweating. That's the worst. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And talk about visual aperture. You're in a small box so it also inspires some claustrophobia even if you're not claustrophobic. That's absolutely true. And the desire to just get out of the thing is where you get a pretty serious adrenaline surge from in the sauna as well. Now, the sauna actually will-- it won't deplete testosterone but it kills sperm. So for people that-- sperm are on a 60 day sperm cycle so if you're trying to donate sperm-- because that's what got us on to this-- or fertilize an egg or eggs in whatever format, dish or in vivo, as we say in science, which means-- well, you can look it up, folks. The 60 day sperm cycle. So if you go into a really hot sauna or a hot bath or a hot tub, in 60 days those sperm are going to be-- a significantly greater portion of them will be dead, will be non-viable. So there's a simple solution. People just put ice pack down there or a jar, not this jar, but a jar of cold fluid between their legs and just sit there, or they go back and forth between the ice bath and the sauna. But you probably-- if you're going to go back over there you should freeze sperm. We're going to do a couple episodes on fertility when it's relatively inexpensive. And you're young so you probably do it now because there is a association with autism as males get older. It's not a strong one. It's significant but it's still a small contribution to the autism phenotype. LEX FRIDMAN: As you age don't sperm get wiser or no? There's no science to back that? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, but men can conceive healthy children at a considerable age. But in any case-- but no, they don't get wiser. What happens is interesting-- LEX FRIDMAN: Finely aged steak. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, it's a little bit like the maturation of the brain in the sense that some of the sperm get much better at swimming and then many of them get less good. Motility is a strong correlate of the DNA of the sperm. LEX FRIDMAN: This is probably a good time to announce that I'm selling my sperm as an NFTs. I wanted to see how much that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh my goodness. LEX FRIDMAN: Riding the crypto wave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, your children, your future children and my future children, are supposed to do jujitsu together since I've only done the one jujitsu class so I'm strongly vested in you having children. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But only in the friendly kind of way. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yes. Friendly competition kind of way. Yeah. Dominance of the clan. Yep. For sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So moving on to science, but still with our minds in the Ukraine. Did you encounter any scientists or see any universities? As we know, in this country and in Europe and elsewhere, science takes infrastructure. You need buildings, you need laboratories, you need robots, you need a lot of equipment, and you need minus 80 freezers and you need incubators and you need money and you need technicians. And typically it's been the wealthier countries that have been able to do more research for sake of research and development and prioritization. Certainly the Ukraine had some marvelous universities and marvelous scientists. What's going on with science and scientists over there? And gosh, can we even calculate the loss of discovery that is occurring as a consequence of this conflict? LEX FRIDMAN: So science goes on. Before the war Ukraine had a very vibrant tech sector, which means engineering and all that kind of stuff, and Kyiv has a lot of excellent universities and they still go on. The biggest hit, I would say, is not the infrastructure of the science, but the fact, because of the high morale, everybody is joining the military. So everybody is going to the front to fight, including you, Andrew Huberman, would be fighting, and not because you have to but because you want to. And everybody you know would be really proud that you're fighting, even though everyone tries to convince, Andrew Huberman, you have much better ways to contribute. There's deep honor in fighting for your country, yes, but there are better ways to contribute to your country than just picking up a gun that you're not that trained with and going to the front. Still, they do it. Scientists, engineers, CEOs, professors, students-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Men and women? LEX FRIDMAN: Actors-- men and women. Obviously, primarily men, but men and women. Much more than you would see in other militaries, women are-- everybody. Everybody wants to fight. Everybody's proud of fighting. There's no discussion of pacifism. Should we be fighting? Is this right? Is this-- everybody's really proud of fighting. So there's this kind of black hole that pulls everything, all the resources, into the war effort that's not just financial but also psychological. So it's like if you're a scientist it feels like what-- it feels almost like you're dishonoring humanity by continuing to do things you were doing before. There's a lot of people that converted to being soldiers. They literally watch a YouTube video of how to shoot a particular gun, how to arm a drone with a grenade. If you're a tech person you know how to work with drones so you're going to use that, use whatever skills you got, figure out whatever skills you got and how to use them to help the effort on the front. And so that's a big hit. But that said, I've talked to a lot of folks in Kyiv-- faculty primarily in the tech economics space, so I didn't get a chance to interact with folks who are on the biology, chemistry, neuroscience side of things, but that still goes on. So one of the really impressive things about Ukraine is that they're able to maintain infrastructure like road, food supply, all that kind of stuff, education, while the war is going on, especially in Kyiv. The war started where nobody knew whether Kyiv was going to be taken by the Russian forces. It was surrounded. And a lot of experts from outside were convinced that Russia would take Kyiv, and they didn't. And one of the really impressive things as a leader-- one of the things I really experienced is that a lot of people criticized Zelenskyy before the war. He only had about 30% approval rate. A lot of people didn't like Zelenskyy. But one of the great things he did as a leader, which I'm not sure many leaders would be able to do, is when Kyiv was clearly being invaded he chose to stay. He stayed in the capital. Everybody, all the American military, the intelligence agencies, NATO, his own staff, advisors all told him to flee, and he stayed. And so I think that was a beacon, a symbol for the rest, for the universities, for science, for the infrastructure that we're staying too, and that kept the whole thing going. There's an interesting social experiment that happened, I think for folks who are interested in gun control in this country in particular, is one of the decisions they made early on is to give guns to everybody. Semi-automatics. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Early on in the war? LEX FRIDMAN: Early on in the war, yeah. So everybody got a gun. They also released a bunch of prisoners from prison because there was no staff to keep the prisons running. And so there's a very interesting psychological experiment of, like, how is this going to go? Everybody has a gun. Are they going to start robbing places? Are they going to start taking advantage of a chaotic situation? And what happened is that crime went to zero. So it turned out that this, as an experiment, worked wonderfully. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's a case where love generalized. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Or at least hate did not. We don't know if it's love or it's sort of lack of initiative for common culture directed hate. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. I don't-- right. I think that's very correct to say that it wasn't hate that was unifying people. It was love of country, love of community. It's probably the same thing that will happen to humans when aliens invade as well. It's the common effort. Everybody puts everything else to the side. Plus just the sheer amount of guns is similar to Texas. You realize, well, there's going to be a self-correcting mechanism very quickly because the rule of law was also put aside, right? Basically the police force lost a lot of power because everybody else has guns and they're kind of taking the law into their own hands. That system, at least in this particular case in this particular moment in human history, worked. It's an interesting lesson, you know? ANDREW HUBERMAN: It is. I had an interesting contrast that I'll share with you because you mentioned Texas. So not so long ago I was in Austin. I often visit you or others in Austin, as you know. And many doors that I walked past, including a school, said no firearms past this point. It was a sticker on the door. You see this on hospitals sometimes. I saw this at Baylor College of Medicine, et cetera. Relatively common to see in Texas, not so common in California. And then I flew to the San Francisco Bay Area, was walking by an elementary school in my old neighborhood, and saw a similar sticker and looked at it and it said, no peanuts or other allergy containing foods past this point on the door of this elementary school. So quite a different contrast, guns and peanuts. Now, peanut allergies, obviously, are very serious for some people, although there's great research out of Stanford showing that early exposure to peanuts can prevent the allergies. But don't start rubbing yourself in peanut butter, folks, if you have a peanut allergy. That's not the best way to deal with it. In any case, the contrast of what's dangerous, the contrast of the familiarity with guns versus no familiarity. In Israel and elsewhere you see machine guns in the airport. In Germany, Frankfurt, you see machine guns in the airport. Not so common in the United States. So again, I feel like there's this aperture of vision. There's this aperture of pleasures versus creature comforts and lack of creature comforts, and then there's this aperture of danger, right? People who are familiar with guns are familiar with people coming in and setting their firearm on the table and eating dinner, you know? But if you're not accustomed to that it's jarring, right? LEX FRIDMAN: I should mention-- people know this throughout human history-- but the human ability to get assimilated now, get used to violence is incredible. So you could be living in a peaceful time, like we're here now, and there would be one explosion, like a 9/11 type of situation. That would be a huge shock. It's terrifying. Everybody freaks out. The second one is a huge drop off in how freaked out you get. And in a matter of days, sometimes hours, it becomes the normal. I've talked to so many people in Kharkiv, which is one of the towns that's seen a lot of heated battle. You ask them, is it safe there? In fact, when I went to the-- closer and closer to the war zone you ask people, is it safe? And their answer's usually, yeah, it's pretty safe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's all signal to noise. LEX FRIDMAN: Nobody has told me except Western reporters sitting in the West Side of Ukraine, it's really dangerous here. Everyone's like, yeah, it's good. My uncle just died yesterday. He was shot. But it's pretty good. The farm is still running. How do I put it? They focus on the positive, that's one. But there's a deeper truth there, which is just get used to difficult situations and the stuff that make you happy and the stuff that make you upset is relative to that new normal that you establish. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I grew up in California and there were a lot of earthquakes. I remember the '89 quake, I remember the Embarcadero Freeway pancaking on top of people and cars. I remember I moved to Southern California, there was a Northridge quake. Wherever I move there seem to be earthquakes. I never worry about earthquakes, ever. I just don't. In fact, I don't like the destruction they cause, but every once in a while an earthquake will roll through and it's kind of exciting. It sounds like a train coming through. It's like, wow, like the Earth is moving. You know? Again, I don't want anyone to get harmed, but I enjoy a good rumble coming through nonetheless. It's signal to noise. But if I saw a tornado I'd freak out, and people from the Midwest are probably comfortable with-- Dan Gable, the great wrestler from the Midwest that you know and I've never met but I have great respect for, he's probably-- sees a tornado and is like, ah, yeah. Maybe. Yeah. You know? So I think signal to noise is real. Before I neglect, although I won't forget, speaking of signal to noise and environment, you are returning to or have gone back to one of your original natural habitats, which is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology which is-- LEX FRIDMAN: Natural habitat, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's actually difficult to pronounce in full. MIT, right? So you've been spending some time there teaching and doing other things. Tell us what you're up to with MIT recently. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, I'm really glad that you, being on the West Coast, know the difference between Boston, New York. I feel like a lot of people think it's like the East Coast. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's very different, especially the Bostonians and New Yorkers. LEX FRIDMAN: They get very aggressive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh my goodness. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, I love it. I gave lectures there in front of a in person crowd. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What were you talking about? LEX FRIDMAN: For the AI, so different aspects of AI and robotics, machine learning-- machine learning. So for people who know the artificial intelligence field they usually don't use the term AI, and people from outside AIs. The biggest breakthroughs in the machine learning field with some discussion of robotics and so on. Yeah. It was in person. It was wonderful. I'm a sucker for that. I really avoided teaching or any kind of interaction during COVID because people put a lot of emphasis on but also got comfortable with remote teaching, and I think nobody enjoyed it. Except there's a notion that it's much easier to do because you don't have to travel. You can do it in your pajamas kind of thing. But when you actually get to do it, you don't get the same kind of joy that you do when you're teaching. As a student you don't get the same kind of joy of learning. It's not as effective and all that kind of stuff. So to be in person together with people, to see their eyes, to get their excitement, to get the questions and all the interactions, that was awesome. And I'm still a sucker and a believer in the ideal of MIT, of the University. I think it's an incredible place. There's something in the air still. But it really hit-- the pandemic hit universities hard because-- and I can say this. This is not you saying it. This is me saying it. That administrations-- as in all cases when people criticize institutions, the pandemic has given more power to the administration and taken away power from the faculty and the students, and that's from everybody involved, including the administration. That's a concern because a university is about the teachers and the students. That should be primary. And whenever you have a pandemic there's an opportunity to increase the amount of rules. One of the things that really bothered me, and I'll scream from the top of the MIT dome, about this is they've instituted a new temp ticket system. Which is if you're a visitor to the campus at MIT, you have to register. You have to, first of all, show that you're vaccinated, but more importantly, there's a process to visiting. You need to get permission to visit. One of the reasons I loved MIT, unlike some other institutions, MIT just leaves the door open to anyone. In classrooms you can roll in the ridiculous characters. The students that are usually doing business stuff or economics can roll into a physics class and just-- you're kind of not allowed but it's a gray area so you let that happen, and that creates a flourishing of a community that was beautiful. And I think adding extra rules puts a squeeze on and limits some of the flourishing, and I hope some of that dissipates over time as we kind of let go of the risk aversion that was created by the pandemic. As we kind of enter the normal return back some of that flourishing can happen. But when you're actually in there with the students, it was magic. I love it. I love it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, some of your earliest videos on your YouTube channel were of you in the classroom, right? That's how this all started. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Yeah. That's how YouTube-- putting stuff on YouTube is terrifying, right? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, especially at the time when you did it. Again, you're a pioneer in that sense. You did that, Jordan Peterson did that. Putting up lectures is-- yeah. I teach still. Every winter I teach-- direct a course, and I'll be doing even more teaching going forward. But the idea of those videos being on the web is-- yeah, that spikes my cortisol a little bit. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. It's terrifying because you get-- and everybody has a different experience. For me being a junior research scientist the kind of natural concern is like, who am I? And when I was giving this lecture it's like, I don't deserve any of this. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's your humility coming through, and I actually think that humility on the part of an instructor is good because those that think that they are entitled, and who else could give this lecture? Then I worry more. I once heard-- I don't know if it's still true-- that at Caltech, the great California Institute of Technology not far from here, that many of the faculty are actually afraid of the students. Not physically afraid, but they're intellectually afraid because the students are so smart. And teaching there can be downright frightening, I've heard. But that's great. Keeps everybody on their toes. And you know, I've been corrected in lecture before at Stanford and elsewhere. When my lab was at UC San Diego where someone will say, hey, wait, last lecture you said this and now you said that-- or on the podcast. You know? And I think it's that moment where you sometimes feel that urge to defend and you go, oh, you're right, and I think it depends on how one was trained. My graduate advisor was wonderful at saying, I don't know, all the time. And she went to Harvard, Radcliffe, UCSF, and Caltech. Brilliant woman. And had no problem saying, I don't know. LEX FRIDMAN: I don't have that problem either. So I usually have two guys that somebody speaks up, grab them, drag them out of the room, never see them again. So everybody is really supportive. You don't understand that the amount of love and support I get is-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Especially when the last few students are there and everybody seems to be nodding as you're going. No, I think that I'd love to sit-in on one of your lectures. I know very little about AI, machine learning, or robotics. But-- LEX FRIDMAN: Have you ever talked at MIT? Have you ever given lectures? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. When I went on the job market as a faculty member my final two choices were between MIT Picower-- I had an on-paper offer. Wonderful place. Wonderful place to do neuroscience. And UC San Diego, which is a wonderful neuroscience program. In the end it made sense for me be on the West Coast for personal reasons, but there's some amazing neuroscience going on there. Goodness. And that's always been true and is going to continue. It's been a long time since I've been invited back there. Oddly enough when I started doing more podcasting-- and I still run a lab but I shrunk my lab considerably as I've done more podcasting-- I've received fewer academic lecture invites, which makes sense. But now they're sort of coming back. And so when people invite now I always say, do you want me to talk about the ventral thalamus and its role in anxiety and aggression or do you want me to talk about the podcast? And my big fear is I'm going to go back to give a lecture about the retina or something and I'll start off with an Athletic Greens read or something like that just reflexively. Just kidding. That wouldn't happen. But listen, I think it's great to continue to keep a foot in both places. I was so happy to hear that you're teaching at MIT because podcasting is one thing, teaching is another, and there's overlap there in the Venn diagram. But listen, the students that get to sit-in on one of your lectures-- and you may see me sitting there in the audience soon when I creep into your class. LEX FRIDMAN: In sunglasses. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's right. Wearing a red shirt. You won't recognize me. Are certainly receiving a great gift. I've watched your lectures on YouTube, even the early ones, and listen, I know you to be a phenomenal teacher. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, there's something about-- so I'm also doing-- I stayed up pretty late last night working for a deadline on a paper. One of the things that I hope to do for hopefully the rest of my life is to continue publishing, and I think it's really important to do that even if you continue the podcast because you want to be just on your own intellectual and scientific journey as you do podcasting. At least for me, and especially on the engineering side because I want to build stuff, and I think that keeps your ego in check, keeps you humble because I think if you talk too much on a microphone you start getting-- you might lose track of the grounding that comes from engineering and from science and the scientific process and the criticisms that you get, all that kind of stuff. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And how slow and iterative it is. We have two papers right now that are in the revision stage, and it's been a very long road. And I was asked this recently because I met with my chairman. He said, do you want to continue to run a lab or are you just going to go full time on the podcast? And Stanford has been very supportive, I must say, as I know MIT has been of you. And I said, oh, I absolutely want to continue to be involved in research and do research. And when you start talking about these papers and we're looking over my-- this was my yearly review and looking back I'm like, goodness, these papers have been in play for a very long time. So it's a long road but you learn more and more, and the more time you spend myopically looking at a bunch of data the more you learn and the more you think. I totally agree. Talking to these devices for podcasts is wonderful because it's fun. It relieves a certain itch that we both have and hopefully it lands some important information out there for people, but doing research is the-- I guess if you know, you know. There's the unpeeling of the onion, knowing that there could be something there. There's just nothing like it. LEX FRIDMAN: I mean, you do-- especially with the pandemic. And for me, both Twitter and the podcast have made me much more impatient about the slowness of the review process because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Twitter will do that. LEX FRIDMAN: Twitter will. But even with podcast you have a cool-- you'll find something cool and then you have ideas and you'll just say them and they'll be out pretty quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Then we do a post right now about something that we both found interesting and it's out in the world. Yep. LEX FRIDMAN: And you can write up something, like there is a culture in computer science of posting stuff on arXiv and preprints that don't get annual review, and sometimes they don't even go through the review process ever because people just start using them if it's code. And it's like, what's the point of this? It works. It's self evident that it works because people are using it, and that I think applies more to engineering fields because it's an actual tool that works. It doesn't matter if-- you don't have to scientifically prove that it works. It works because it's using for a lot of people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, sorry to interrupt, but I just-- for point of reference, the famous paper describing the double helix which earned Watson and Crick the Nobel Prize and should have earned Rosalind Franklin Nobel Prize too, of course, but they got it for the structure of DNA of course. That paper was never reviewed at Nature. They published it because its importance was self evident, or whatever. They decided-- LEX FRIDMAN: So the editors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It was that purely editorial decision, I believe. I mean, that's what I was told by someone who's currently an editor at Nature. If that turns out to not be correct someone will tell us in the comments for sure. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, I think-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's pretty interesting, right? LEX FRIDMAN: That's really interested. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perhaps the most significant discovery in biology and bioengineering which was leading to bioengineering as well, of course, of the last century was not peer reviewed. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, but-- so Eric Weinstein, but many others have talked about this, which is, I mean, I don't think people understand how poor the peer review process is. Just the amount of-- because you think peer review it means all the best peers get together and they review your stuff, but it's unpaid work and it's usually a small number of people. And they have a very select perspective so they might not be the best person, especially if it's super novel work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And it's who has time to do it. I'm on a bunch of editorial boards still. Why, I don't know, but I enjoy the peer review process and sending papers out. Oftentimes the best scientists are very busy and don't have time to review. And oftentimes the more premiere journals will select from a kind of a unique kit of very good scientists who are very close to the work, sometimes the people are very far from the work. It really depends. LEX FRIDMAN: And both have negatives, right? If you're very close to the work there's jealousy, and all those basic human things. Very far from the work you might not appreciate the nuanced contribution, all that kind of stuff. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And there's psychology. Sorry to interrupt again, but a good friend of mine who's extremely successful neuroscientist, Howard Hughes investigator, et cetera, always told me that they-- I won't even say whether or not who they are. They select their reviewers on the basis of who has been publishing very well recently because they assume that that person is going to be more benevolent because they have been doing well so that the love expands. LEX FRIDMAN: That's a good point to that, actually. But the idea is that editors might actually be the best reviewers, so that was the traditional-- that's the thing I wanted to mention that Eric Weinstein talks about, that back several decades ago editors had much more power. And there is something to be made for that because editors are the ones who are responsible for crafting the journal. They really are invested in this, and they're also often experts, right? It makes sense for an editor to have a bit of power in this case. Usually if an idea is truly novel you could see it, And so it makes sense for an editor to have more power in that regard. Of course for me, I think peer review should be done the way tweets are done, which is crowdsourced or Amazon reviews. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Let the crowd decide. LEX FRIDMAN: Let the crowd decide, and let the crowd add depth and breadth and context for the contribution. So if the paper overstates the degree of contribution, the crowd will check you on that. If there's not enough support or the conclusions are not supported by the evidence, the crowd will check you on that. There could be, of course, political bickering that enters the picture, especially on very controversial topics, but I think I trust the intelligence of human beings to figure that out. And I think most of us are trying to figure this whole process out. I just wish it was happening much faster because on the important topics, the review cycle could be faster. And we learned that through COVID that Twitter was actually pretty effective at doing science communication. It was really interesting. Some of the best scientists took to Twitter to communicate their own work and other people's work, and always putting into the caveats that it's not peer reviewed and so on, but it's all out there and the data just moves so fast. And if you want stuff to move fast, Twitter is the best medium of communication for that. It's cool to see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like to take a brief break and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there, however, is that you get data back about metabolic factors, lipids, and hormones and so forth, but you don't know what to do with those data. InsideTracker solves that problem and makes it very easy for you to understand what sorts of nutritional, behavioral, maybe even supplementation based interventions you might want to take on in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors, hormones, lipids, and other things that impact your immediate and long term health to bring those numbers into the ranges that are appropriate and, indeed, optimal for you. If you'd like to try InsideTracker you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman to get $200 off an ultimate plan or 34% off the entire site as a special Black Friday deal now through the end of November. Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman, and use the code Huberman at checkout. I'm now on Twitter more regularly, and initially it was just Instagram. And I remember you and I used to have these over dinner or drink conversations where I'd say, I don't understand Twitter. And you'd say, I don't understand Instagram. And of course, we understand how it worked and how to work each respective platform, but I think we were both trying to figure out what is driving the psychology of these different venues because they are quite distinct psychologies for whatever reason. I think I'm finally starting to understand Twitter and enjoy it a little bit. Initially I wasn't prepared for the level of reflexive scrutiny. It sounds a little bit oxymoronic, but that people pick up on one small thing and then drive it down that trajectory. It didn't seem to be happening quite as much on Instagram, but I love your tweets. I do have a question about your Twitter account and how you-- do you have sort of internal filters of what you'll put up and won't put up? Because sometimes you'll put up things that are about life and reflections. Other times you'll put up things like what you're excited about in AI, or of course, point to various podcasts including your own, but others as well. How do you approach social media? Not in how do you regulate your behavior on there in terms of how much time, et cetera. I know you've talked about that before. But you know, what's your mindset around social media when you go on there to either post or forage or respond to information? LEX FRIDMAN: I think I try to add some-- not the sound cliche, but some love out there into the world into, as OJ Simpson calls it, Twitter world. I think there is this viral negativity that can take hold, and I try to find the right language to add good vibes out there. And it's actually really, really tricky because there's something about positivity that sounds fake. I can't quite put my finger on it, but whenever I talk about love and positive and almost childlike in my curiosity and positivity, people start to think, surely he has skeletons in the closet. There's dead bodies in his basement. This must be a fake-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, it's the attic. LEX FRIDMAN: It's the attic? ANDREW HUBERMAN: The attic. LEX FRIDMAN: I keep mine in the basement. That's the details. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I was referring to your attic. I don't have an attic or a basement, nor dead bodies. I just want to be very clear. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. I do have an attic and actually I haven't been up there. Maybe there is bodies up there. But yes, I prefer the basement. It's colder down there. I like it. No, but there's an assumption that this is not genuine or it's disingenuous in some kind of way. And so I try to find the right language for that kind of stuff, how to be positive. Some of it I was really inspired by Elon's approach to Twitter. Not all of it, but when he just is silly. I found that silliness-- I think it's Hermann Hesse said something to paraphrase-- one of my favorite writers-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, same. LEX FRIDMAN: I think in Steppenwolf said, learn what is to be taken seriously and laugh at the rest. I think I try to be silly, laugh at myself, laugh at the absurdity of life, and then in part when I'm serious, try to just be positive, just to see a positive perspective. And also, as you said, people pick out certain words and so on and they attack each other, attack me over certain usage of words in a particular tweet. I think the thing I try to do is think positively towards them, like do not escalate. So whenever somebody's criticizing me and so on, I just smile. If there's a lesson to be learned, I learn it and then I just send good vibes their way. Don't respond, and just hopefully, through karma and through the ripple effect of positivity, have an impact on them and the rest of the Twitter. And what you find is that builds-- your actions create the community. So how I behave gets me surrounded by certain people. But lately, especially Ukraine is one topic like this, I also thought about talking to-- somebody who reached out to me is Andrew Tate, who's extremely controversial. From the perspective of a lot of people is a misogynist. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I've heard his name and I know that there's a lot of controversy around him. Maybe you could familiarize me. I've been pretty nose down in podcast prep and I tried to do this vacation thing for about three, four weeks. LEX FRIDMAN: I've heard about that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. And it sort of worked. I did get some time in the Colorado wilderness by myself, which was great. I did get some downtime. But in any event, it mainly consisted of reading and-- LEX FRIDMAN: And nature? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Reading and nature, sauna, ice bath, working out, good food, a little extra sleep, these kinds of things I really felt I needed it. But I am pretty naive when it comes to the kind of current controversies but I've heard his name, and I think he's been deplatformed on a couple of platforms. Do I have that right? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, he's been-- so I should also admit that while I might know more than you, it's not by much. So it's like a five-year-old talking to a four-year-old right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is he an athlete, a podcaster? LEX FRIDMAN: So basic summary, he used to be a fighter, a kickboxer, I believe. Was pretty successful. And then during that and after that I think he was on a reality show, and he had all these programs that are basically pickup artist advice. He has this community of people where he gives advice on how to pick up women, how to be successful in relationships, how to make a lot of money, and it costs money to enter those programs. So a lot of the criticism that he gets is kind of-- it's like a pyramid scheme where you convince people to join so that they can make more money and then they convince others to join, and that kind of stuff. But that's not why I'm interested in talking to him. I'm interested because one of the guests-- maybe I should mention who, but one of the female guests I had, really a big scientist, said that her two kids that are 13 and 12 really look up to Andrew to entertain-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is it male children, female children? LEX FRIDMAN: Male. And I hear this time and time again. So he is somebody that a lot of teens, young teens, look up to. So I haven't done serious research. I usually try to avoid doing research until I agree to talk and then I go deep. But there is an aspect to the way he talks about women that, while I understand and I understand certain dynamics in relationships work for people and he's one such person, but I think him being really disrespectful towards women is not what I-- it's not how I see what it means to be a good man. So the conversation I want to have with him is about masculinity. What does masculinity mean in the 21st century? And so when I think about that kind of stuff, and because we're talking about Twitter, it's like going into a war zone. I'm a happy go lucky person, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: You're like, send me to Ukraine, but I don't want to have this conversation on Twitter. LEX FRIDMAN: Because it's a really, really, really tricky one because also, as you know, when you do a podcast, everybody wants you to win. It's everything you do is positive. Maybe you'll say the wrong thing as inaccurate thing and you can correct yourself. With Andrew Tate, with Donald Trump, with folks like this, you have to-- I mean, it's a professional boxing. I think you have to push the person. You have to be really eloquent. You have to be also empathetic because you can't just do what journalists do, which is talk down to the person the entire time. That's easy. The hard thing is to empathize with the person, to understand them, to steel man their case, but also to make your own case. So in that case about what it means to be a man, to me a strong man is somebody who is respectful to women. Not out of weakness, not out of social justice warrior signaling, and all that kind of stuff, but out of that's what a strong man does. They don't need to be disrespectful to prove their position in life. He is often-- now, a lot of people say it's a character. He's being misogynistic. He's being a misogynist as a kind of-- for entertainment purposes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So like an avatar. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. But to me, that avatar has a lot of influence on young folks so the character has impact. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, I don't think you can separate the avatar and the person in terms of the impact, as you said. In fact, there are a number of accounts on Twitter and Instagram and elsewhere which people have only revealed their first names or they give themself another name or they're using a cartoon image. And part of that, I believe, in at least from some of these individuals who actually know who they are, I understand as an attempt to maintain their privacy, which is important to many people. And in some cases so that they can be more inflammatory and then just pop up elsewhere as something else without anyone knowing that it's the same person. LEX FRIDMAN: Some of-- this is the dark stuff. I've been reading a lot about Ukraine and Nazi Germany, so the '30s and the '40s and so on, and you get to see how much the absurdity turns to evil quickly. One of the things I worry-- one of the things I really don't like to see on Twitter and the internet is how many statements end with LOL. It's like you think just because something is kind of funny or is funny or is legitimately funny, it also doesn't have a deep effect on society. So that's such a difficult gray area because some of the best comedy is dark and mean, but it reveals some important truth that we need to consider. But sometimes comedy is just covering up for destructive ideology, and you have to know the line between those two. Hitler was seen as a joke in the late '20s and the '30s in Nazi Germany until the joke became very serious. You have to be careful to know the difference between the joke and the reality and do all that. I mean, in a conversation-- I'm just such a big believer in conversation to be able to reveal something through conversation, but I don't know. One of the big-- you and I challenge ourselves all the time. I don't know if I have what it takes to have a good, empathetic, but adversarial conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I need to learn more about this Tate person, or not learn about them. Yeah. It sounds like maybe it's something to skip. I don't know because, again, I'm not familiar with the content. But I was going to ask you whether or not you've seeked out or whether or not you would ever consider having Donald Trump as a guest on your podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, I've talked to Joe a lot about this and I really believe I can have a good conversation with Donald Trump, but I haven't seen many good conversations with him. So part of me thinks-- part of me believes it's possible, but he often effectively runs over the interviewer. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You could sit him down, give him an element in Athletic Greens. LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That nice, cool, air conditioned black curtain studio you've got and a different side might come out. Context is powerful. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's really good at this, which is relaxing the person. Like here, have a drink. Smoke a joint, or whatever it is. But this energy of just, let's relax, and there's laughter and so on. I don't think-- as people know, I'm just not good at that kind of stuff. So I think the way I could have a good conversation with him is to really understand his worldview, be able to steel man his worldview and those that support him. Which is, I'm sorry to say for people who seem to hate Donald Trump, is a very large percentage of the country. And so you have to really empathize with those people. You have to empathize with Donald Trump, the human being, and from that perspective, ask him hard questions. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So who do you think is the counterpoint if you're going to seek balance in your guests. If you're going to have Trump on, then you have to have who on? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that's interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anthony Fauci seems to be strongly associated with counter values, at least in the eye of the public. I think he's retiring soon, but. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, he's retiring. So that's really interesting, Anthony Fauci. Yeah, definitely, but I don't think he's a counterbalance. He's a complicated, fascinating figure who seems to have attracted a lot of hate and distrust, but also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: And love from some people. LEX FRIDMAN: And love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And love from some people. I mean, I know people, not even necessarily scientists, who have pro-Fauci shirts. I've seen people with anti-Fauci shirts, excuse me, certainly, but who adore him. There are people who adore him in the same way there are people that adore Trump. It's so interesting that one species of animal you get such divergent neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: It almost feels like it's by design and every single topic we find tension and division is fascinating to watch. I mean, I got to really witness it from zero to a hundred in Ukraine, where there is not huge significant division. There was in certain parts of Ukraine, but across Europe, across the world there was not that much division between Russia and Ukraine, and it was just born overnight, this intense hatred. You see the same kind of stuff with Fauci over the pandemic. At first we were all huddled in uncertainty. There is a togetherness with the pandemic. Of course, there is more difficult because you're isolated. But then you start to figure out-- probably the politicians and the media try to figure out, how can I take a side here and how can I now start reporting on this side or that side and say how the other side is wrong? And so I think Anthony Fauci is a part of just being used as a scapegoat for certain things as part of that kind of narrative of division. But I think-- so Trump is a singular figure that, to me, represents something important in American history. I'm not sure what that is, but I think you have to think-- you put on your historian hat, go forward in time, and think back. How will he be remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years from now? Who is the opposite of that? You have to-- I would really have to think about that because Trump was so singular. I think AOC is an interesting one, but she's so young it's unclear to know how-- if she represents a legitimately large scale movement or not. Bernie Sanders is an interesting option, but I wish he would be 30, 40 years younger. The young Bernie would be a good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: There are scientists working on that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, I think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not him specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. We never know. There is a big conspiracy theory that Putin is-- that that's a body double. It's no longer him. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bernie is Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm having a hard time merging that image. LEX FRIDMAN: The conspiracy theory is-- no, no, no. That the Putin we see on camera today is a body double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one thing that in science, and in particular, in anatomy, there's a classification scheme for different types of anatomists, which they either say you're a lumper or a splitter. Some people like to call a whole structure something, not necessarily just for simplicity but for a lot of reasons. And then other people like to microdivide the nucleus into multiple names. And of course, people used to be able to name different brain structures after themselves. So that would be the nucleus of Lex and the Huberman vesiculus or whatever. Less of that nowadays. And by the way, those structures don't actually exist just yet. We haven't defined those yet. I was making those names up. But what's interesting is it seems like in the last five years, there's been a lot of trend-- there's been a trend, excuse me, toward a requirement for lumping. You can't say-- it seems that it's not allowed, if you will, to say, hey, yeah, you know-- and here I'm not stating my-- I will never reveal my preferences about pandemic related things for hopefully obvious reasons. Some people will say vaccines, yes, but masks, no. Or vaccines and masks, yes, but let people work. And other people will say, no, everyone stay home. And then other people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let everybody work. No one was saying no vaccines, no masks, and stay home, I don't think. So there's this sort of lumping, right? The boundaries around ideology really did start to defy science. I mean, it wasn't scientific. It was one part science-ish at times and sometimes really hardcore science. Other times it was politics, economics. I mean, we really saw the confluence of all these different domains of society that use very different criteria to evaluate the world. I mean, as a scientist, I remember when the vaccines first came out and I asked somebody, one of the early concerns I had that was actually satisfied for me was, how does this thing turn off? If you start generating mRNA, how does it actually get turned off? So I asked a friend, they know a lot about RNA biology. And I said, you know, how does it turn off? They explained it to me and I was like, OK, makes sense. I asked some other questions. But most people aren't going to think about it at that level of detail necessarily, but it did seem that there was just kind of amorphous blobs of ideology that they grabbed on to things and then there was this need for a chasm between them. It was almost felt like it became illegal, in some ways, to want two of the things from that menu and one of the things from that menu. I really felt like I was being constrained by a kind of like Bento box model where I didn't get to define what was in the Bento box. I could either have Bento box A or Bento box Z, but nothing in between. LEX FRIDMAN: And I think on that topic and I think a lot of topics, most people are in the middle with humility, uncertainty, and they're just kind of trying to figure it out. And I think there is just the extremes defining the nature of this division. So I think it's the role of a lot of us in our individual lives, and also if you have a platform of any kind, I think you have to try to walk in the middle with the empathy and humility. And that's actually what science is about is the humility. I'm still thinking about who's the opposite of Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe there is none. I mean, maybe Fauci is orthogonal to Trump. I mean, not everything has an opposite. I mean, maybe he's an n of 1 maybe he's in the minority of one because he was an outsider from Washington who then made it there. LEX FRIDMAN: But also I wonder-- you have to pick your battles because every battle you fight you should take very seriously. And just the amount of hate I get, I got, and I still get for having sat down with the Pfizer CEO, that was a very valuable lesson for me. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, that one got you a lot of heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, it still does because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Because you had some pretty controversial guests on from time to time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, that one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is he still the Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: I believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs turn over like crazy. This is the thing I didn't realize. In science if somebody moves institutions it's a big deal. Most people don't have more than two moves in their career, maybe. But they often move to the next building is a big deal. But it in biotech-- it's like have a former colleague of mine from San Diego and he's been a CEO here, then he's a CEO there. He went back to a company he was a CEO before. He's probably back at the university we worked at for all I know. It's amazing how much moving around there. It is a very itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, I think they're-- in certain companies, I guess in biotech would be the case, the CEO is more of like a manager type so you can-- jumping around benefits your experience so you become better and better being a manager. There's some leader revolutionary CEOs that stick around for longer because they're so critical to pivoting a company, like the Microsoft CEO currently. Sundar Pichai is somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk is somebody like that that is part of pivoting a company into new domains constantly, but yeah. In biotech there's a machine. In the eyes of a lot of people, big pharma is like big tobacco. It's the epitome of everything that is wrong with capitalism. It's evil, right? And so I showed up in the conversation where I thought with a pretty open mind and really asked what I thought were difficult questions of him. I don't think he's ever sat down to a grilling of that kind. In fact, I'm pretty sure they cut the interview short because of that, and I thought literally it was hot in the room and we're sweating and I was asking tough questions. For somebody that half the country or a large percent of the country believes he's alleviated a lot of-- he helped, through the financial resources that Pfizer has, helped alleviate a lot of suffering in the world. And so I thought for somebody like that, I was asking pretty hard questions. Boy, did I get to hear from the side-- usually one of the sides is more intense in their anger. So there are certain political topics-- like with Andrew Tate, for example, I would hear from a very-- it would probably be the left, far left, that would write very angrily. And so that's a group you'll hear from. The Pfizer CEO, I didn't get almost any messages from people saying, why did you go so hard on him? He's an incredible human, incredible leader and CEO of a company that helped us with the vaccine that nobody thought would be possible to develop so quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You did not get letters of that sort? LEX FRIDMAN: I did not. I mean, here and there, but the sea of people that said everything from me being weak that I wasn't able to call out this person, how do you sit down, how do you platform this evil person, how do you make him look human, all that kind of stuff. And you have to deal with that. You have to-- of course, it's great. It's great because I have to do some soul searching, which is like, did I? You have to ask some hard questions. I love criticism like that. You get to-- I had some low points. There's definitely some despair and you start to wonder, was I too weak? Should I have talked to him? What is true? And you sit there alone and just marinate in that. Hopefully over time that makes you better, but I still don't know what the right answer with that one is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I feel that money plays a role here. When people think big pharma, they think billions of dollars-- maybe even trillions of dollars, really. And certainly people who make a lot of money get scrutiny that others don't. Part of it is that they are often not always visible, but I think that there is a natural and reflexive-- and I'm not justifying it. I certainly don't feel this because I know some people who are very wealthy, some people who are very poor. I can't say it scales with happiness at all. People are always shocked to hear that, but that's what I've observed in very wealthy people. But that people who have a lot of money are often held to a different standard because people resent that, some people resent that, and maybe there are other reasons as well. I mean, among people who are very wealthy, oftentimes the wish is for status, right? Not money. You get a bunch of billionaires in a room, and unless one of them is Elon, who also has immense status for his accomplishments, typically if you put a Nobel Prize winner in a room with a bunch of billionaires they're all talking to that person. Right? And there are many very interesting billionaires. But status is something that is often but not always associated with money, but is a much rarer form of uniqueness out there, a positive uniqueness-- if one considers status positive because there's a downside to. So I wonder whether or not the Pfizer CEO caught extra heat because people assume, and I probably assume also, that his salary is quite immense. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. So because I have a lot of data on this. I can answer it. It's a very good hypothesis. Let's test that scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: He's about to tell me it's a great hypothesis but it's wrong. I know the smirk. I know the smirk. LEX FRIDMAN: I honestly think it's wrong. That effect is there for a lot of people, but I think the distrust is not towards the CEO. The distrust is towards the company. One of the really difficult soul searching I had to do, which is just having to interact with Pfizer folks at every level, from junior to the CEO, they're all really nice people. They have a mission. They talk about trying to really help people because that's the best way to make money is to come up with medicine that helps a lot of people. The mission is clear. They're all good people, a lot of really brilliant people, PhDs. So you can have a system where all the people are good, including the CEO. And by good, I mean people that really are trying to do everything. They dedicate their whole life to do good. And yet, you have to think that that system can deviate from a path that does good because you start to deceive yourself of what is good, you turn it into a game where money does come into play from a company perspective where you convince yourself the more money you make, the more good you'll be able to do. And then you start to focus more and more and more on making more money, and then you can really deviate and lose track of what is actually good. I'm not saying necessarily Pfizer does that, but I think companies could do that. You can apply that criticism to social media companies, to big pharma companies. One of the big lessons for me-- I don't know what the answer is, but that all the people inside the company can be good, people you would want to hang out with, people you would want to work with, but as a company is doing evil. That's a possibility. So the distrust I don't think is towards the billionaire individual, which I do see a lot of in this case. I think it's Wall Street distrust, that the machinery of this particular organization has gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's the generalization of hate again. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. And then good luck figuring out what is true. This is the tough stuff. But I should say the individuals-- individual scientists at the NIH and Pfizer are just incredible people. They're really brilliant people. I never trust the administration or the business people-- no offense, business people. But the scientists are always good. They have the right motivator in life. But again, they can have blinders on. Too focused on the science. Nazi Germany has a history of people just too focused on the science and then the politicians use the scientists to achieve whatever end they want. But if you just look narrowly at the journey of a scientist, it's a beautiful one because they're ultimately in it for the curiosity, the moment of discovery versus money. I mean, prestige probably does come into play later in life, but especially young scientists. They're after the-- it's like they're pulling at the threat of curiosity to try to discover something big. They get excited by that kind of stuff, and it's beautiful to see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It is beautiful see. I have a former graduate student, now a postdoc at Caltech, and I don't even know she had a cell phone. She would come in the lab, put her cell phone into the desk, and she was tremendously productive. But that wasn't why I brought it up. She was productive as a side effect of just being absolutely committed and obsessed to discover the answers to the questions she was asking as best she could, and it was-- you could feel it. You could just feel the intensity, and just incredibly low activation energy. If there was an experiment to do she would just go do it. You're teaching at MIT. You are obviously traveling the world, you're right on the podcast a lot of coverage of chess recently, which is interesting. I don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, I have some scientific questions to you about that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. Let's get to those for sure. And then-- LEX FRIDMAN: You're not going to like it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. And then also some very-- do I have to spell Massachusetts again? LEX FRIDMAN: Of course. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Also you still seem to have a proclivity for finding guests that are controversial, right? You're thinking about Tate, we're talking about Trump, we're talking about the Pfizer CEO, we're talking about Fauci. These are intense people. And so what we're getting folks is a-- we're not doing neuroimaging here in the traditional sense of putting someone into a scanner. What we're doing here is we're using, as the great Karl Deisseroth, who was on your podcast-- LEX FRIDMAN: Thank you for that. Thank you for connecting us. He's an incredible person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: He's an incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, and human being and writer, and your conversation with him was phenomenal. I listened to it twice. I actually have taken notes. We talk about it in this household. We really do. His description of love is not to be missed, I'll just leave it at that, because if I try and say it I won't capture it well. But we're getting a language based map of at least a portion of Lex Fridman's brain here. So what else is going on these days in that brain as it relates to robotics, AI? Our last conversation was a lot about robots and the potential for robot-human interaction. Even what is a robot, et cetera. Are you still working on robots or focused on robots, and where is science showing up in your life besides the things we've already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: So I think the last time we talked was before Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. You were just about to leave. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. I mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: So that's why I went on. I was like, you know, this might be the last-- you said you wanted to come out here before or after. I was like, come out there before. I want to see you before you go. But here you are in the flesh. LEX FRIDMAN: So a lot of-- just a lot of my mind has been occupied, obviously, with that part of the world. But most of the difficult struggles that I'm still going through is that I haven't launched the company that I want to launch and the company has to do with AI. I mean, it's maybe a longer conversation, but the ultimate dream is to put robots in every home. But short term I see there a possibility of launching a social media company, and it's a nontrivial explanation why that leads to robots in the home. But it's basically the algorithms that fuel effective social robotics, so robots that you can form a deep connection with. And so I've been really-- yeah, I've been building prototypes but struggling that I don't have maybe, if I were to be critical, the guts to launch a company. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Or the time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, it's combined. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think you've got the guts. I mean, it's clear if you'll do an interview with the Pfizer CEO and you're considering putting this Tate fellow on your podcast and you've gone to the Ukraine that you have the guts. It means not doing quite a lot of other things. LEX FRIDMAN: That's what I mean. It does take-- the thing is, as many people know, when you fill your day and you're busy, that busyness becomes an excuse that you use against doing the things that scare you. A lot of people use family in this way. You know, my wife, my kids, I can't. When in reality some of the most successful people have a wife and have kids and have families and they still do it. And so a lot of times we can fill the day with busy work, with-- yeah, of course, I have podcasts and all this kind of stuff. And they make me happy and they're all-- they're wonderful and there's research, there's teaching, and so on. But all of that can just serve as an excuse from the thing that my heart says is the right thing to do, and that's why I don't have the guts, the guts to say no to basically everything and then to focus all out. Because part of it is I'm unlikely to fail at anything in my life currently because I've already found a comfortable place. With a startup it's mostly going to be-- most likely going to be a failure, if not an embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, the machine learning data that I'm aware of-- I don't know a lot about machine learning, but within the realm of neuroscience, say that a failure rate of about 15% is optimal for neuroplasticity and growth. Whether or not that translates to all kinds of practices isn't clear, but getting trials right 85% of the time seems to be optimal for language learning, seems to be optimal for mathematics, and it seems to be optimal for physical pursuits on average, right? I'm sure I'm going-- you have more machine learning geeks that listen to your podcast than listen to this podcast, but it doesn't mean you have to fail on 15% of your weight sets, folks. I mean, it could be 16%. No, I'm just kidding. It's not exact, but it's a pretty good rule of thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: I think a lot of startup founders would literally murder for 85% chance of success. I think given all the opportunities I have, the skill set, the funding, all that kind of stuff, my chances are relatively high for success. But what relatively high means in the startup world is still far, far below 85. You're talking about single digit percentages. Most startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I think it means-- the decision to focus on the company and not on other things means the decision to close the hatch on dopamine retrieval from all these other things that are very predictable sources of dopamine. Not that everything is dopamine, but dopamine is, I think, the primary chemical driver of motivation. If you know that you can get some degree of satisfaction from scrolling social media or from that particular cup of coffee, that's what you're going to do. That's what you're going to consume unless you somehow invert the algorithm and you say, it's actually my denial of myself drinking that coffee that's going to be the dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And that's the beauty of having a forebrain is that you can make those decisions. This is the essence, I do believe, of what we see of David Goggins. There's much more there. There's a person that none of us know and only he knows, of course. But the idea that the pain is the source of dopamine. The limbic friction, as I sometimes like to call it, is the source of dopamine. That runs counter to how most nervous systems work, but it's decision based, right? It's not because his musculature is a certain way or he had CRISPR or something. It's because he decides that. And I think that's amazing, but what it means in terms of starting a company and changing priorities is a closing the hatch on all or many of the current sources of dopamine so that you can derive dopamine from the failures within this narrow context, and there's a very reductionist view and neurocentric view of what we're talking about. But I think about this a lot. I mean, the decision to choose one relationship versus another is a decision to close down other opportunities, right? So I think that the decision to order one thing off the menu versus others is the decision to close down those other hatches. So I think that you absolutely can do it. It's just a question of, can you flip the algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Remap the source of dopamine to something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. And maybe go out there not to succeed but make the-- the journey is the destination type thing, but when you're financially vested in your time-- and as far as I know, we only get one life, at least on this planet and you want to spend that wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN: And a lot of the people that surround you-- people are really important, and I don't have people around me that say you should do a start up. It's very difficult to find such people because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is Austin big startup culture right now? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, it is. It is. But it doesn't make sense for me to do a startup. This is what the people that love me my whole life have been telling me, it doesn't make sense what you're doing right now. Just do the thing you were doing previously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Why do I get the sense that because they are saying this you're apt to go against them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, I was never that, unfortunately. Unfortunately, I need-- I've talked to people I love, my parents, family, and so on, friends. I'm one of those people that needs unconditional support for difficult things. I know myself coaching wise is good-- so here's how I get coached best. Let's say wrestling. I like a coach that says, you want to win the Olympics? They will not-- if I say I want to win the gold medal at the Olympics in freestyle wrestling I want a coach that doesn't blink once and hears me and believes that I can do it, and then is viciously intense and cruel to me on that pursuit. If you want to do this, let's do this. Right? But that's support. That positivity, I don't-- I'm never-- I'm not energized, nor do I see that as love, a person saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, you're too old to win the Olympic gold medal, right? Or all the things you can come up with. That's not helpful to me and I can't find a dopamine, or I haven't yet, a dopamine source from the haters. Basically people that are criticizing you, trying to prove them wrong. It never got me off. It never-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Whereas some people seem to like that. I mean, David Goggins seems to come to mind. He seems driven by many sources. He has access-- I don't know because I've never asked him, but if I were to venture a guess, I'd say that he probably has a lot of options inside his head as how to push through challenge. Not just overcome pain, but he'll post sometimes about the fact that people will say this or people will do this and talk about the pushback approach. He'll also talk about the pushback approach that's purely internal that doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. There's literally like a voice he yells that represents some kind of devil that wants him to fail, and he calls them bitch and all kinds of things saying, you know, fuck you. I'm not. There's always an enemy and he's going against that enemy. I mean, I wish-- maybe that's something. I mean, it's really interesting. Maybe you can remap it this way so that you can construct-- that's a kind of obvious mechanism. Construct an amorphous blob that is a hater that wants you to fail, right? That's kind of the David Goggins thing. And that blob says you're too weak, you're too dumb, you're too old, you're too fat, you're too whatever, and getting you to want to quit and so on. And then you start getting angry at that blob, and maybe that's a good motivator. I haven't personally really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I've had external challenge when I was a postdoc, very prominent laboratory-- several prominent laboratories, in fact, were working on the same thing that I was, and I was just this lowly postdoc working on a project pretty independent from the lab I was in. And there was competition but there was plenty of room for everybody to win, but in my head-- and frankly, I won't disclose who this is. And because there was some legitimate competition there and a little bit of friction-- not too much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, I might have pushed a few extra hours or more, a little bit. I have to say, it felt metabolizing. It felt catabolic, right? I couldn't be sustained by it. And I contrast that with the podcast or the work that my laboratory is doing now focused on stress and human performance, et cetera, and it's pure love. It's pure curiosity and love. I mean, there are hard days, but I never-- there's no adversary in the picture. They're the practical workings of life that-- LEX FRIDMAN: That was the thing that Joe really inspired me on, and people do create adversarial relationships in podcasting because you get-- YouTubers do this. They hate seeing somebody else be successful. There's a feeling of jealousy, and some people even see that as healthy. Mr. Beast is somebody, some of these popular YouTubers, how do they get 100 million views and I only get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr. Beast devoted his entire-- according to him, his entire life he's been focused on becoming this massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that, he's inspiring in many ways, but there's some people that become famous for doing much less insane pursuit of greatness than Mr. Beast. People become famous and on social media and so on, and it's easy to be jealous of them. One of the early things I've learned from Joe just being a fan of his podcast is how much he celebrated everybody. And again, maybe I ruined my whole dopamine thing but I don't get energized by people that become popular. In the podcasting space and YouTube, it doesn't-- it's awesome. All of it is awesome and I'm inspired by that. But the problem is that's not a good motivator. Inspiration is like, oh, cool, humans can do this. This is beautiful. But it's not-- I'm looking. I'm looking for a forcing function. That's why I gave away the salary from MIT. I was hoping my bank account had zero. That would be a forcing function to be like, oh shit. You know? And you're not allowed to have a normal job, so I wanted to launch-- and then the podcast becomes a source of income. So it's like, goddammit. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, and here I have to confess my biases. You are so good at what you do in the realm of podcast-- and you're excellent at other things as well, I just have less experience in those things. I know here I'm taking the liberty of speaking for many, many people in just saying, I sure as hell hope you don't shut down the podcast. But as your friend and as somebody who cares very deeply about your happiness and your deeper satisfaction, if it's in your heart's heart to do a company, well then, damn it, do the company. LEX FRIDMAN: And a lot of it I wouldn't even categorize as happiness. I don't know if you have things like that in your life, but I'm probably the happiest I could possibly be right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's wonderful. LEX FRIDMAN: But the thing is there's a longing for the start up that has nothing to do with happiness. It's something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's that itch. That's that itch. LEX FRIDMAN: I'm pretty sure I'll be less happy because it's a really tough process. I mean, to whatever degree you can extract happiness from struggle, yes, maybe. But I don't see it. I think I'll have some very, very low points. There's a lot of people who find companies-- found companies know about. And I also want to be in a relationship, I want to get married, and sure as hell a startup is not going to increase the likelihood of that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We could start up a family and start a company. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that's a-- I'm a huge believer in that, which is get in a relationship at a low point in your life, which is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. I'm not disputing your stance, nor am I agreeing with it. It's just every once in a while there's a Lex Fridmanism that hits a particular circuit in my brain. I have to just laugh out loud. LEX FRIDMAN: I just think that it's easy to have a relationship when everything is good. The relationships that become strong and are tested quickly are the ones when shit is going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, then there's hope for me yet. Before we sat down I was having a conversation with my podcast producer, who is a-- I wouldn't say avid, rather he's a rabid consumer of podcasts and finds these amazing podcasts, small podcasts and unique episodes. Anyway, we were talking about some stuff that he had seen and read in the business sector, and he was talking about the difference between job, career, and a calling, right? And I think he was extracting this from conversations of CEOs and founders, et cetera. I forget the specific founders that brought this to light for him. But that this idea that if you focus on a job you can make an income, and hopefully you enjoy your job or not hate it too much. A career represents a sort of, in my mind, a kind of series of evolutions that one can go through-- junior professor, tenure, et cetera. But a calling has a whole other level of energetic pull to it because it includes career and job and it includes this concept of a life. It's very hard to draw the line between a calling in career and a calling in the other parts of your life. So the question, therefore, is, do you feel a calling to start this company or is it more of a compulsion that irritates you? Is it something you wish would go away or is it something that you hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, I hope it won't go away. It's a calling. It's a calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: It's like when I see a robot-- when I first interacted with robots, and it became even stronger the more sophisticated the robots I interacted, with I see a magic there. And you're like, you look around, does anyone else see this magic? It's kind of like maybe when you fall in love, like that feeling. Does anyone else notice this person that just walked in the room? I feel that way about robots, and I can elaborate what that means but I'm not even sure I can convert it into words. I just feel like the social integration of robots in society will create a really interesting world. And our ability to anthropomorphize when we look at a robot and our ability to feel things when we look at a robot is something that most of us don't yet experience, but I think everybody will experience in the next few decades. And I just want to be a part of exploring that because it hasn't been really thoroughly explored. The best roboticists in the world are not currently working on that problem at all. They try to avoid human beings completely, and nobody's really working that problem in terms of when you look at the numbers. All the big tech companies that are investing money, the closest thing to that is Alexa and basically being a servant to help tell you the weather or play music and so on. It's not trying to form a deep connection. And so sometimes you just notice the thing. Not only do I notice the magic. There's a gut feeling, which I try not to speak to because there's no track record, but I feel like I can be good at bringing that magic out of the robot. And there's no data that says I would be good at that, but there's a feeling. It's just a feeling. Because I've done so many things-- I love doing playing guitar, all that kind of stuff, jujitsu. I've never felt that feeling. When I'm doing jujitsu I don't feel the magic of the genius required to be extremely good. At guitar I don't feel any of that. But I've noticed that in others, great musicians, they notice the magic about the thing they do and they ran with it. And I just always thought-- I think it had a different form before I knew robots existed, before I existed. The form was more about the magic between humans. I think of it as love, but the smile that two friends have towards each other when I was really young. And people would be excited when they first know each other and notice each other, and there's that moment that they share that feeling together. I was like, wow, that's really interesting. It is really interesting that these two separate intelligent organisms are able to connect all of a sudden on this deep emotional level. It's like, huh. It's just beautiful to see, and I notice the magic of that. And then when I started a programming-- programming, period, but then programming AI systems, you realize, oh, that could be-- that's not just between humans and humans. That could be humans and other entities, dogs, cats, and robots. And so I-- for some reason it hit me the most intensely when I saw robots. So yeah, it's a calling. But it's a calling that I can just enjoy the vision of it, the vision of a future world, of an exciting future world that's full of cool stuff, or I can be part of building that. And being part of building that means doing the hard work of capitalism, which is like raising funds from people, which for me, right now, is the easy part, and then hiring a lot of people. I don't know how much you know about hiring, but hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring excellent people. LEX FRIDMAN: Excellent people that will define the trajectory of not only your company, but your whole existence as a human being. And building it up, not failing them because now they all depend on you, and not failing the world with an opportunity to bring something that brings joy to people. And all of that pressure, just non-stop fires that you have to put out. The drama, the having to work with people you've never worked with like lawyers and human resources and supply chain. And because this is very compute heavy, the computer infrastructure, managing security, cybersecurity, because you're dealing with people's data. So now you have to understand not only the cybersecurity of data and the privacy, how to maintain privacy correctly with data, but also the psychology of people trusting you with their data. And how, if you look at Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey and those folks, they seem to be hated by a large number of people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- I didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think I always think of Jack as a loved individual, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, you have a very positive view of the world, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I like Jack a lot and I like his mind and I-- someone close to him described him to me recently as he's an excellent listener. That's what they said about Jack, and that's my experience of him too. Very private person so we'll leave it at that. But listen, I think Jack Dorsey is one of the greats of the last 200 years and is just much quieter about his stance on things than a lot of people. But much of what we see in the world that's wonderful, I think we owe him a debt of gratitude. I'm just voicing my stance here, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: And the person. This is really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: A wonderful person, a brilliant person, a good person, but you still have to pay the price of making any kind of mistakes as the head of a company. You don't get any extra bonus points for being a good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But his willingness to go on Rogan and deal directly and say, I don't know an answer to that in some cases. But to deal directly with some really challenging questions to me earned him tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. As an individual. He was still part of him-- you've said-- OK, and I love Jack too, and I interact with him often. ANDREW HUBERMAN: He's been on your podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. But he's also part of a system, as we talked about, and I would argue that Jack shouldn't have brought anyone else with him on that podcast. If you go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, that's right. He had a cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, he had I guess the head legal with him. And also it requires a tremendous amount of skill to go on a podcast like Joe Rogan and be able to win over the trust of people by being able to be transparent and communicate how the company really works because the more you reveal about how a social media company works, the more you open up for security, the vector of attacks increases. Also, there's a lot of difficult decisions in terms of censorship and not that are made that if you make them transparent you're going to get an order of magnitude more hate. So you have to make all those kinds of decisions, and I think that's one of the things I have to realize is you have to take that avalanche of potentially hate if you make mistakes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, you have a very clear picture of this architecture of what's required in order to create a company. Of course, there's division of labor too. I mean, you don't have to do all of those things in detail, but finding people that are excellent to do-- to run the critical segments is obviously key. I'll just say what I said earlier, which is if it's in your heart's heart to start a company, if that, indeed, is your calling, and it sounds like it is, then I can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: Does the heart have a heart? I don't know. What's that expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN: We romanticize the heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: In my lab at one point, early days we worked on cuttlefish, and they have multiple hearts, but they pump green blood, believe it or not. Very fascinating animal. Speaking of hearts and green blood, earlier today before we sat down I solicited four questions on Instagram in a brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: Do you want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: If you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look at some of them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, let's take these in real time. My podcast team is always teasing me that I never have any charge on my phone. I'm one of these people that likes to run in the yellow, or whatever it is. LEX FRIDMAN: An iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: It's funny how always the iPhone people are out of battery. It's weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I just got a new one. LEX FRIDMAN: So weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I mean, this one has plenty of battery. I just got a new one so I have different numbers for different things, personal and work, et cetera. I'm trying that now. All right. Get into the-- LEX FRIDMAN: I have a chess thing too to mention to you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yes, please. Will I insult you if I look up these questions as you ask me? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no. But I will insult you by asking you this question because I think it's hilarious. So there's been a controversy about cheating where Hans Niemann, who is a 2,700 player-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was accused of cheating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I saw that clip on your clips channel. By the way, I love your clips channel, but I listen to your full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: The big accusation is that he cheated by having-- I mean, it's half joke but it's starting getting me to wonder whether-- so that you can cheat by having vibrating anal beads so you can send messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let's rephrase that statement. Not you can, but one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, thank you. LEX FRIDMAN: That was a personal attack, yes. But it made me realize, I mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm just going to adjust myself in my seat here. LEX FRIDMAN: I use it all the time for podcasting to send myself messages to remind myself of notes. But it's interesting. I mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm not going to call you again. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, that's exactly where I keep my phone. It did get me down this whole rabbit hole of, well, how would you be able to send communication in order to cheat in different sports? I mean, that doesn't even have to do with chess in particular, but it's interesting in chess and poker that there's mechanisms modern day where you're streaming live the competition so people can watch it on TV. If they can only send you a signal back, they-- it's just a fun little thing to think about and if it's possible to pull off. So I wanted to get your scientific evaluation of that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: To cheat using some sort of interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating of some kind. Yeah. Or no, no. That's one way to send signals is, like, Morse code, basically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. So there's a famous-- I believe there's a famous real world story of physics students-- I'm going to get some of this wrong so I'm saying this in kind of coarse form so that somebody will correct this. But I believe it was physics graduate students from UC Santa Cruz or somewhere else, maybe it was Caltech-- a bunch of universities so that no one associates it with any one university that went to Vegas and used some sort of tactile device for card counting thing. This was actually demonstrated also-- not this particular incident, I don't think-- in the movie Casino where they spotted a-- I remember Robert De Niro, who you have a not so vague resemblance to, by the way, in Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, I wish I had a De Niro impression right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look it up, folks. Travis Bickle is if Lex ever shaved his head into a Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: I would. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So he had a tapping device on his ankle that was signaling. Someone else was counting cards and then signaling to that person. So yeah, that could be done in the tactile way. It could be done, obviously, earpieces if it's deep earpiece. I think there are ways that they look for that. Certainly any kind of vibrational device in whatever orifice provided someone could pay attention to that while still playing the game. Yeah, I think it's entirely possible. Now, could it be done purely neurally? Could there be something that was-- and listen, it wouldn't have to even be below the skull. This is where whenever people hear about Neuralink or brain machine interface they always think, oh, you have to drill down below the skull and put a chip below into the skull. I think there are people walking around nowadays with glucose monitoring devices, like Levels-- which I've used and it was very informative for me, actually, as a kind of an experiment. Gave me a lot of interesting insights about my blood sugar regulation, how it reacts to different foods, et cetera. Well, you can implant a tactile device below the skin with a simple incision. Actually, one of the neurosurgeons at Neuralink I know well because he came up at some point through my laboratory and was at Stanford, and he actually has put in a radio receiver in his hand, and his wife has it too. And he can open locks of his house and things like that, so he's been doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: Under the skin? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Under the skin. You can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: How does that work? So how do you use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: A piercer. You go to a body piercer type person and they can just slide it under there, and it's got a battery life of something and some fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: How do you experience the tactile-- the haptics of it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. That just allows him to open certain locks with just his hand, but you could easily put some sort of tactile device in there. LEX FRIDMAN: But does it have to connect to the nerves or is it just like-- just vibration? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: And you can probably sense it even if it's under the skin, I wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And it can be by-- it can be Bluetooth linked. I mean, I've seen-- there's an Engineering Laboratory at the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, that's got an amazing device which is about the size of a Band-Aid. It goes on the clavicles and it uses sound waves pinged into the body to measure cavitation. Think about this for a moment. This is being used in the military where, let's say, you're leading an operation or something. People are getting shot, shot at, and on a laptop you can see where the bullet entry points are. Are people dead? Are they bleeding out? Entry, exit points. You can get-- take it out of the battlefield scenario. You can get breathing, body position 24 hours a day. There's so much that you can do looking at cavitation. So these same sorts of devices on 12 hour Bluetooth could be used to send all sorts of signals. Maybe every time you're supposed to hold your hand-- I'm not a good gambler so I only play roulette when I go to Vegas because you just long, boring games, but you get some good mileage out of each out of each run, usually. But maybe every time you're supposed to hold, the person gets a stomach cinching because this is stimulating the vagus a little bit and they get a little bit of an ache. So it doesn't have to be Morse code. It can be yes, no, maybe. Right? It can be green, red, yellow type signaling. It doesn't have to be very sophisticated to give somebody a significant advantage. Anyway, I haven't thought about this in detail before this conversation but, oh, yeah, there's an immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: I don't know if you know a poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, I don't follow the gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, he's considered to be one of the greatest poker players of all time legitimately. He's just incredibly good. But he got-- there's this big case where he was accused of cheating and prove-- and it's not really cheating, which is what's really fascinating. Is it turns out-- so he plays poker. Texas Hold'em, mostly, but all kinds of poker. It turns out that the grid on the back of the cards is often printed a little bit imperfectly, and so you can use the asymmetry of the imperfections to try to figure out certain cards. So if you play and you remember that a certain card is, like-- I think the 8 in that deck that he was accused of-- an 8 and 9 were slightly different symmetry wise. So he can now ask the dealer actually to rotate it to check the symmetry. So you would ask the dealer to rotate the card to see that there's-- to detect the asymmetry of the back of the card, and now he knows which cards are 8's and 9's or likelier to be 8's and 9's, and he was using that information to play poker and win a lot of money. But it's just a slight advantage. And his case is-- and in fact, the judge found this, that he's not actually cheating, but it's not right. You can't use this kind of extra information. So it's fascinating that you can discover these little holes in games if you pay close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. It's fascinating. And I think that I did watch that clip about the potential of a cheating event in chess, and the fact that a number of chess players admit to cheating at some point in their career. Very, very interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, it was online. So online cheating is easier, right? When you're playing online cheating in a game where the machine is much better than the human, it's very difficult to prove that you're human. And that applies, by the way, another really big thing is in social media, the bots. If you're running a social media company you have to deal with the bots and they become-- one of the really exciting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence, to me, is the very fast improvement of language models. So neural networks that generate text, that interpret text, that generate from text, images and all that kind of stuff. But you're now going to create incredible bots that look awfully a lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, at least they're not going to be those crypto bots that seem to populate my comment section when I post anything on Instagram. I actually delete those even though they add to the comment roster and if-- they bother me so much. I spend at least 10, 15 minutes on each post just deleting those. I don't know what they need to do but I'm not interested in those, whatever it is they're offering. Speaking of nonbots, I'm going to assume that all the questions are not from bots. There are a lot of questions here-- more than 10,000 questions. Goodness. I'll just take a few, working from top to bottom. What ideas have you been wrestling with lately? And I think about the company as one, but as I scroll to the next, what are some others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, some of the things we've talked about, which is the ideas of how to understand what is true, what is true about a human being, how to reveal that, how to reveal that through conversation, how to challenge that properly, that it leads to understanding not derision. So that applies to everybody from Donald Trump to Vladimir Putin. Also another idea is there's a deep distrust of science in trying to understand-- the growing distrust of science, trying to understand what's the role of those of us that have a foot in the scientific community, how to regain some of that trust. Also, there's-- as we talked about, how to find and how to-- yeah, how to find and how to maintain a good relationship. I mean, that's really been-- I've never felt quite as lonely as I have this year with Ukraine. It's just like, so many times I would just lay there and just feeling so deeply alone because I felt that my home-- not my home literally because I'm an American. I'm a proud American. I'll die an American. But my home in the sense of generationally, my family's home, is now going-- has been changed forever. There's no more being proud of being from the former Russia or Ukraine. It's now a political message to say-- to show your pride, and so it's been extremely lonely. And within that world, with all the things I'm pursuing, how do you find a successful relationship? It has been tough. But obviously-- and there's a huge number of technical ideas with the startup of, like, how the hell do you make this thing work? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, the relationship topic is one we talked a little bit about, and last time we touched on in a little bit more detail. We're going to come back to that, so I've made a note here. What or who inspired Lex, you, to wear a suit every time you podcast? That's a good question. I don't know the answer to that. LEX FRIDMAN: So there's two answers to that question. One is a suit and two is a black suit and black tie because I used to do-- I used to have more variety, which is like it was always a black suit but I would sometimes do a red tie and a blue tie. But that was mostly me trying to fit in to society because varieties-- you're supposed to have some variety. What inspired me at first was a general culture that doesn't take itself seriously in terms of how you present yourself to the world. So in academia, in the tech world, at Google, everybody was wearing pajamas and very relaxed. In the tech. I don't know how it is in the science, in the chemistry, biology, and so on. But in computer science everybody was very-- I mean, very relaxed in terms of the stuff they wear so I wanted to try to really take myself seriously and take every single moment seriously and everything I do seriously, and the suit made me feel that way. I don't know how it looks, but it made me feel that way. And I think, in terms of people I look up to that wore a suit that made me think of that is probably Richard Feynman. I see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: He was a wonderful human being. LEX FRIDMAN: I see him as the epitome of class and humor and brilliance, and obviously I could never come close to that kind of-- be able to simply explain really complicated ideas and to have humor and wit, but definitely aspire to that. And then there's just the Mad Men, that whole era of the '50s, the classiness of that. There's something about a suit that both removes the importance of fashion from the character. You see the person. I think not to-- I forgot who said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel or somebody like this. Is that you wear a shabby dress and everyone sees the dress. You wear a beautiful dress and everybody sees the woman. So in that sense it was-- hopefully I'm quoting that correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX FRIDMAN: I think there's a sense in which a simple, classy suit allows people to focus on your character and then do so with the full responsibility of that, this is who I am. Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love that, and I love what you said just prior to that. My father, who, again, is always asking me why I don't dress formally like you do always said to me growing up, if you overdress slightly, at least people know that you took them seriously. So it's a sign of respect for your audience too in my eyes. Someone asked, is there an AI equivalent of psychedelics? And I'm assuming they mean is there something that machines can do for themselves in order to alter their neural circuitry through unconventional activation patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, I don't know exactly how psychedelics work, but you can see that with all the diffusion models now with Dali and the stable diffusion that generates from text, art. It's basically a small injection of noise into a system that has a deep representation of visual information. So it is able to convert text to art in introducing uncertainty into that noise into that. That's kind of maybe. I could see that as a parallel to psychedelics, and it's able to create some incredible things. From a conceptual understanding of a thing, it can create incredible art that no human, I think, could have at least easily created through a bit of introduction of randomness. Randomness does a lot of work in the machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW HUBERMAN: There are a lot of requests of you for relationship, a lot of requests about statistics about you, data about you specifically. Flipping past those, what was the hardest belt to achieve in jujitsu? I would have assumed the black belt, but is that actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. I mean, everybody has a different journey through jujitsu, as people know. For me, the black belt was the ceremonial belt, which is not usually the case, because I fought the wars. I trained twice a day for I don't know how many years-- seven, eight years. I competed nonstop. I competed against people much better than me. I competed against many and beaten many black belts and brown belts. I think, for me personally, the hardest belt was the brown belt because, for people who know jujitsu, the size of tournament divisions for blue belts and purple belts is just humongous. Like Worlds, when I competed at Worlds it was, like, 140 people in a division, which means you have to win-- I forget how many times, but seven, eight, nine times in a row to medal. And so I just had to put in a lot of work during that time. And especially for competitors, instructors usually really make you earn a belt. So to earn the purple belt was extremely difficult. Extremely difficult. And then to earn the brown belt means I had to compete nonstop against other purple belts, which are young. You're talking about-- the people that usually compete are, like, 23, 24, 25-year-olds that are shredded, incredible cardio. They can, for some reason, are in their life where they can-- no kids, nothing. They can dedicate everything to this pursuit so they're training two, three, four times a day. Diet is on point. You're going-- and for me, because they're usually bigger and taller than me and just more aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah, I had to go through a lot of wars to earn that brown belt. But then-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: I got to try this jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, you should. But it's a different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I tried it. I did the one class, but I really want to embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: As you know, many pursuits like jujitsu are different if you're doing it in your 20s and 30s and later. It's like it's a different-- you're not-- you can have a bit of an ego in your 20s. You can have that fire under you, but you should be more zenlike and wise and patient later in life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one would hope. That's the wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: I think Rogan is still a meathead. He still goes hard and crazy and he's still super competitive on that, so some people can-- Jocko is somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, whatever they're doing they're doing something right because they're still in it, and that's super impressive. There were far too many questions to ask all of them, but several, if not many, asked a highly appropriate question for where we are in the arc of this discussion. And this is one, admittedly, that you ask in your podcast all the time, but I get the great pleasure of being in the question asker seat today. And so, what is your advice to young people? LEX FRIDMAN: So I just gave a lecture at MIT and the amount of love I got there is incredible. And so of course, who you're talking to is usually undergrads, maybe young graduate students, and so there one person did ask for advice as a question at the end. I did a bunch of Q&A. So my answer was that the world will tell you to find a work-life balance, to explore, to try to-- try different fields to see what you really connect with, variety, general education, all that kind of stuff. And I said in your 20s I think you should find one thing you're passionate about and work harder at that than you worked at anything else in your life. And if it destroys you, it destroys you. That's advice for in your 20s. I don't know how universally true that advice is, but I think at least give that a chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice towards a thing you really care about, and work your ass off. That said, I've met so many people, and I'm starting to think that advice is best applied or best tried in the engineer disciplines, especially programming. I think there's a bunch of disciplines in which you can achieve success with much fewer hours, and it's much more important to actually have a clarity of thinking and great ideas and have an energetic mind. The grind in certain disciplines does not produce great work. I just know that in computer science and programming it often does. Some of the best people ever that have built systems, have programmed systems are usually like the John Carmack kind of people that drink soda, eat pizza, and program 18 hours a day. So I don't know actually. You have to, I think, really go discipline specific. So my advice applies to my own life which has been mostly spent behind that computer, and for that you really, really have to put in the hours. And what that means is essentially it feels like a grind. I do recommend that you should at least try it in your own. That if you interview some of the most accomplished people ever, I think if they're honest with you they're going to talk about their 20s as a journey of a lot of pain and a lot of really hard work. I think what really happens, unfortunately, is a lot of those successful people later in life will talk about work-life balance. They'll say, you know what I learned from that process is that it's really important to get, like, sun in the morning, to have health, to have good relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire a chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, a chef. Exactly. But I think you have forgot-- those people have forgotten the value of the journey they took to that lesson. I think work-life balance is best learned the hard way. My own perspective. There are certain things you can only learn the hard way, and so you should learn that the hard way. Yeah, so that's definitely advice. And I should say that I admire people that work hard. If you want to get on my good side, I think there are the people that give everything they got towards something. It doesn't actually matter what it is, but towards achieving excellence in a thing. That's the highest thing that we can reach for as human beings I think is excellence at a thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love it. Well, speaking of excellent at a thing. Whether or not it's teaching at MIT or the podcast or the company that resides in the near future that you create-- once again, I'm speaking for an enormous number of people that excellence and hard work, certainly, are woven through everything that you do. Every time I sit down with you I begin and finish with such an immense feeling of joy and appreciation and gratitude, and it wouldn't be a Lex Fridman podcast, or in case of Lex even being a guest on a podcast, if the word love weren't mentioned at least 10 times. So the feelings of gratitude for all the work you do, for taking the time here today to share with us what you're doing, your thoughts, your insights, what you're perplexed about and what drives you and your callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can I read a poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please. He was trying to cut me off post. That was getting a little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no, no. I was thinking about this recently. It's one of my favorite Robert Frost poems, and I-- because I wrote several essays on it, as you do, because I think it's a popular one that's read. Essays being, like, trying to interpret poetry, and it's one that sticks with me. I mean, both its calm beauty, but in the seriousness of what it means because I ultimately think it's the-- so \\\"Stopping by a Woods on a Snowy Evening.\\\" I think it's ultimately a human being, a man, asking the old Sisyphus, the old Camus question of, why live? I think this poem, even though it doesn't seem like it is a question of a man contending with suicide and choosing to live. Whose woods these are, I think I know. His house is in the village, though. He will not see me stopping here to watch his woods fill up with snow. My little horse must think it queer to stop without a farmhouse near between the woods and frozen lake, the darkest evening of the year. He gives this harness bells a shake to ask if there's some mistake. The only other sound's the sweep of easy wind and downy flake. The woods are lovely, dark, and deep, but I have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep, and miles to go before I sleep. The woods representing the darkness, the comfort of the woods representing death, and he's a man choosing to live. Yeah, I think about that often, especially my darker moments is you have promises to keep. Thank you for having me, Andrew. You're a beautiful human being. I love you, brother. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love you, brother. Thank you for joining me today for my discussion with Dr. Lex Fridman, and special thanks to Dr. Lex Fridman for inspiring me to start this podcast. If you're learning from and/or enjoying this podcast, please subscribe to our YouTube channel. That's a terrific zero cost way to support us. In addition, please subscribe to the podcast on Spotify and on Apple, and on both Spotify and Apple you can leave us up to a five star review. If you have questions or suggestions about topics and guests you'd like me to include on the Huberman Lab podcast, please put those in the comments section on YouTube. I do read all the comments. In addition, please check out the sponsors mentioned at the beginning of today's episode. That's the best way to support this podcast. During today's episode we did not discuss supplements, but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast we do discuss supplements because while supplements aren't necessarily for everybody, many people derive tremendous benefit from them for things like enhancing sleep and focus and hormone augmentation and so forth. The Huberman Lab podcast has partnered with Momentous Supplements because they are of the very highest quality and they ship internationally. In addition to that, they have single ingredient formulations that allow you to devise the supplement regimen that's most effective and most cost effective for you. If you'd like to see the supplements discussed on the Huberman Lab podcast, please go to livemomentous.com/huberman. If you haven't already signed up for the Huberman lab podcast zero cost neural network newsletter, we invite you to do so. It's a monthly newsletter that has summaries of podcast episodes and various protocols distilled into simple form. You can sign up for the newsletter by going to hubermanlab.com, go to the menu, and look for Newsletter. You supply your email, but we do not share it with anybody else. And as I mentioned before, the newsletter is completely zero cost. And if you're not already following us on social media, we are @hubermanlab on Instagram, @hubermanlab on Twitter, and @hubermanlab on Facebook, and at all of those sites I provide science and science related tools for mental health, physical health, and performance, some of which overlap with information covered on the Huberman Lab podcast, but often which is distinct from information covered on the Huberman Lab podcast. So again, that's @hubermanlab on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. Thank you, again, for joining me for the discussion with Dr. Lex Fridman, and as always, thank you for your interest in science.

And today I'm going to talk about what I like to refer to as The Power of Play. The Power of Play, resides in plays ability to change our nervous system for the better, so that we can perform many activities, not just play activities, better. Play can also function as a way to explore new ways of being in different scenarios in work, in relationships, in settings of all kind, and indeed also in the relationship to oneself.

And basically what's happening here is as any of us bring our visual window in more narrowly as we contract our visual window, which is exactly what happens when we're looking at a little smartphone in front of us. It seems to suppress the breathing apparatus because we know that physiological sighs are controlled by a specific set of neurons in the brain stem called the parafacial nucleus discovered by Dr. Jack Feldman.

The fact that the information that we're reading on the internet and on our phones is emotionally disturbing or distressing in some way. And that probably is true as well in many cases.

Now in researching this episode, I thought that I was going to come across a bunch of papers that say this brain area connects to that brain area, which controls play in animals. And there's similar areas in babies and in adults. And indeed, that's true. And we will talk about brain circuitry, but I think more importantly is to understand what is the utility of play?

We'll talk about mischief a little bit later, but they sort of look at an environment or a social setting as an opportunity for different kinds of novel interactions. Other people and I'd probably put myself into this category. If I walk into a novel environment, I tend to be more in the mode of just assessing what that environment is like.

And therein lies a very interesting portal to understanding what the utility, what the purpose of play is. First of all, I want to lay down a couple of key facts about play that point to the fact that play is not just about games. Play is about much, much more and play and in particular, how we played as a child and still how we can play as adults is really how we test and expand our potential roles in all kinds of interactions.

Meaning the frequencies of sound are just too high for you to hear, but with the appropriate devices, he was able with his colleagues to isolate this so-called the \"Rat Laughter\" and then turns out there\\'s kitten laughter and there\\'s puppy laughter.

Now this is important because it moves this thing that we call play from the dimension of higher order functions or things evolved recently, you know, that are really kind of at the front edge of human evolution, deeper into the circuitry of the brain, whereby we say the brain stem, the kind of ancient parts of the brain are going to be involved.

And it's rich with neurons that make endogenous opioids. So these are not the kinds of opioids that are causing the opioid crisis. These are neurons that you and I all have that release endogenous, meaning self-made or biologically made opioids. They go by names like enkephalin and things of that sort. Play evokes small amounts of opioid release into the system. They kind of dope you up a little bit, not so much as one would see if one were to take exogenous opioids.

And that turns out to be a very important chemical state because there's something about having an abundance of these endogenous opioids released into the brain that allows other areas of the brain, like the prefrontal cortex, the area of the front that's responsible for what we call executive function. Executive function is the ability to make predictions, to assess contingencies. Like if I do this, then that happens. If I do that, then that happens.

Even if we listen to new forms of music or we go see new art or new movies, those are new experiences, but that's not us making new predictions about what's going to happen next. It's not the brain working to figure out new possibilities. And so you can immediately see how just a small increase in your willingness to put yourself into conditions where you don't understand all the rules perhaps, or you're not super proficient at something, but you enter it because it is low stakes.

Now, when they do this posture, it's obvious that they're lowering themselves. They're not in an aggressive stance, because they're lowering their head. And this is universally known among canines as play posture. There's some famous videos online.

This has been seen again and again and again. Another hardwired feature of so-called play postures is what's called soft eyes. When animals are aggressive, or when they're sad, they tend to reduce the size of their eye openings by basically making their eyelids closer together, somewhat, by keeping their eyes together in particular for aggression, they'll bring their eyes towards what we call a vergence eye movement. Bring it towards the center that actually narrows the aperture of the visual field.

And so immediately you can start to see how play starts to call into action, social dynamics in which both parties have to make some sort of agreement about how high the stakes are. Now, the failures to do this are also very informative in how we develop in social groups. And this also can inform why some people really play well with others and other people don\\'t.

Again, not suggesting this I\\'m not responsible for what happens if you do, but there were rules and the rules were, for instance, you couldn\\'t pack rocks into the dirt clods and you could run across to the other side and you could jump on the other person\\'s mound and you could throw dirt clods in there.

But the idea is that there's an agreed upon set of rules about how high the stakes are and what we're all going to do. And this is separate from sport where there are clearly defined rules about what's out of bounds. What's in-bounds. What sorts of behaviors will get you a yellow card or a red card for instance on the soccer field, all animals including humans are doing this low stakes contingency testing and all animals including humans you'll find, start to up the stakes.

What's too hard and what's soft. And so humans do this as well. Now you can look at your adult, counterparts, and indeed we should probably look at ourselves and ask, you know did we learn proper play contingency when we were younger?

It\\'s about rule testing and low stakes contingency rule breaking also serves an important role as is with the example of the \"Dirt Clod War\" puppies biting other puppies et cetera. And last but not least, there are different forms of play that help us establish who we will become as adults. One of the more powerful of these is role play when children and sometimes adults will take on different roles that are distinct from their natural world roles in order to for instance, establish hierarchies.

You have to take in a lot of information about your environment all the time and make predictions. But if you are suddenly cast into a new role, well then you definitely have to make even more predictions from a different standpoint. So these are very powerful for teaching the brain, how to function.

Yes, there are brain games and apps that can support neuroplasticity. But if you really want to engage neuroplasticity at any age, what you need to do is return to the same sorts of practices and tools that your nervous system naturally used throughout development. And it evolved over hundreds of thousands of years to trigger this thing that we call neuroplasticity. And the reason this is so important is because it starts to move us away from what some people call hacks. I define hacks as using one thing for a different purpose to kind of get a shortcut.

It involves focusing very intensely or at least focusing somewhat on whatever it is that one is trying to learn, and then engaging in deep rest, ideally deep sleep in the following nights.

But what this tells us is that what we do in the process of play as children is really how we set up the rules for how we behave as adults in almost all domains, which is really incredible. And of course the reassuring thing is that playing as an adult will allow you to expand on those neural circuits. You can literally grow new connections.

And I should say that if you\\'re interested in learning more about this, the paper that I found particularly informative is published in Current Psychology and the title is \"Personal play identity and the fundamental elements in its development process.\" And the author of course, is Gökhan Güneş G U N E S last name. This is from 2021. So recent review. There are four components to personal play identity, how you play, your personality, socio culture and environment. So that\\'s the third one that\\'s together, socio culture environment, and economics and technology. Now that sounds somewhat complex, and this paper is somewhat complex, but basically what it says is that we bring together certain aspects of ourselves and how we react to different place scenarios when we\\'re younger.

The point is that if we look back to our early adolescence, somewhere between 10 and 14 years old, a peak time for social development, a peak time for play of various kinds, a peak time for motor development, a peak time of psychosocial development, where we learn where we fit into hierarchies.

I've talked about the incredible work of Allan Schore on previous episodes of the podcast. Allan Schore is a psychiatrist and has done extensive work on how parent child interactions in particular baby and mother, but also baby and father shaped the brain and the brain and emotional system's ability to go from states of elation and excitement, the so-called dopamine epinephrine type circuitry to the more warm soothing types of calm interactions that in broad terms could be described as more serotonin oxytocin and things of that sort.

The recommendation that I make, and certainly the one that I'm going to direct it myself as well is to try and engage in at least one hour of pure play per week. Now I came to that recommendation because of the literature that says, well, you need to engage something pretty repetitively. It should be novel. So this wouldn't be something that you are exceptionally good at already. If you insist on doing something that you're already exceptionally good at, then you want to really do some free form, low stakes tinkering. So make it safe, but make it free form.

Play is really about not even worrying if you\\'re going to get good at it or really proficient at it. It\\'s really about exploring contingencies with truly low stakes. That\\'s what will allow you to access these neurochemical combinations of elevated endogenous opioids, low epinephrine, et cetera, that will open up neuroplasticity. For those of you that need a little more guidance on how to play.

For the purpose of opening up these neural circuits for plasticity, the key feature of course, is to not have immense proficiency in that given activity, or at least not the way you perform it. And if you do gain proficiency in that activity, well, then it becomes something else it\\'s no longer about play it\\'s performance. So in that case, you would then want to adopt a new play behavior. You\\'ll notice that I largely avoided using the word fun throughout this episode.

In the realm of neurobiology, we have sensations which are the processes by which our neurons, nerve cells convert light, photons, sound waves, touch, mechanical pressure, et cetera into electrical signals and chemical signals that head into our nervous system, including our brain. And then our brain, at least we think, make sense of them, and help us navigate the world that we're in.

So we have sensations and perceptions. Then we have emotions which are these things that include the mind and body that are related to neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, et cetera, although, those chemicals do other things as well.

Thoughts are real, and one way that we can define thoughts is that thoughts are perceptions that include data from the past, present, or future, or combinations of past and present, or present and future, or future and past.

I think one of the world's foremost leaders on the issue of trauma and psychiatry and psychology generally. He defines trauma as an event or something that fundamentally changes the way that your nervous system works such that you function less adaptively going forward from that event. So not every bad occurrence in your life is a trauma. That's good news.

There's a range of quality of therapists for that matter, so we're always referring to the desire for people to do great therapy with really great, meaning excellently trained people.

Now obviously, you want to do this in a way that is fairly structured. So you ideally would use complete sentences. So the reason for doing that is that thoughts, as I mentioned earlier, can often be fragmentary. So they pop up in our mind almost we seemingly spontaneously.

And really it's far and away different from the 30-day abstinence approach that Dr. Anna Lembke was talking about for substance or behavioral addictions. Now, of course, this process of abstaining from thoughts or removing the addictive nature of certain thoughts can definitely take some time. So a good example there would be superstitions.

And it was clearly a little bit of an OCD type thing, but again, OCD in air quotes here. I think it qualified as OCD in the sense that the more I did it, the more I wanted to do it. So I needed to go cold turkey on the thinking, but how can you go cold turkey on a thought? You couldn't.

Do you just say the entire image is a picture of a cat? Do you do what's very commonly been done, which is a bounding box, you have a very crude box around the cat's face saying, this is a cat? Do you do semantic segmentation? Mind you, this is a 2D image of a cat. So it's not, the computer knows nothing about our three-dimensional world, is just looking at a set of pixels.

So, what happens, is one of the big trade-offs in reinforcement learning, is this exploration versus exploitation. So, when you know very little, it pays off to explore a lot, even suboptimal, like even trajectories that seem like they're not going to lead anywhere, that's called exploration. The smarter and smarter and smarter you get, the more emphasis you put on exploitation, meaning you take the best solution, you take the best path.

This current discussion about a robot, is something I personally really enjoy, just brings me happiness, I really try to do now everything that just brings me joy, I maximize that 'cause robots are awesome. But two, given my like little bit growing platform, I want to use the opportunity to educate people. Like robots are cool. And if I think they're cool, I hope be able to communicate why they're cool to others. So, this little robot experiment is a little bit of research project too, there's a couple of publications with MIT folks around that. But the other is just to make some cool videos and explain to people how they actually work. And as opposed to people being scared of robots, they could still be scared, but also excited, like see the dark side, the beautiful side, the magic of what it means to bring, for a machine to become a robot. I want to inspire people with that.\"},\n",

And then the honesty of being submitted, or being worse than you thought you are and just sitting with that knowledge, that kind of honesty, we don't get to experience it in most of daily life.

Dr. Johnson is a professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, where he also directs the Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research. As many of you know, there's extreme excitement about the use of psychedelics for the treatment of various disorders of the mind. Dr. Johnson's laboratory is among the premier laboratories in the world understanding how these compounds work, how things like Psilocybin, and LSD, and related compounds allow neural circuitry in the brain to be shaped and changed, such that people can combat diseases, like depression, or trauma, or other disorders of the mind that cause tremendous suffering.

Well, Matthew, I've been looking forward to this for a long time. I'm a huge fan of your scientific work, and I'm here to learn from you. So- - Likewise. Big fan and happy to do this with you. - All right, well, thank you. My first question is a very basic one, which is, what is a psychedelic? We hear this term all the time, but what qualifies a substance as a psychedelic? - Nomenclature is a real challenge in this area of psychedelics. So starting with the word psychedelic, if you're a pharmacologist, it's not very satisfying, because that term really spans different pharmacological classes. In other words, if you're really concerned about receptor effects and the basic effects of a compound, it spans several classes of compounds. But overall... So\"},\n",

So it's really more of a cultural term, or it does have a relationship to drug effects, but it's at a very high level. So all of the so-called psychedelics across these distinct classes that I can talk more about, the way I put it, is they all have the ability to profoundly alter one's sense of reality, and that can mean many things. Part of that is profoundly altering the sense of self acutely, so when someone's on the psychedelic. So the different classes that can be, the specific pharmacological classes that can be called a psychedelic, are, one, what are called the classic psychedelics.

I think there was a little of of a tendency to stay away from psychedelics, because of the baggage, but there's been a return to that in the last several years. But the classic psychedelics or classic hallucinogens are things like LSD, psilocybin, which is in so-called magic mushrooms. It's in over 200 species that we know of so far of mushrooms. Dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, which is in dozens and dozens of plants. Mescalin, which is in the peyote cacti, and some other cacti, like San Pedro. And even amongst these classic psychedelics there are two structural, structural classes. So that's the chemistry. There's the tryptamine-based compounds, like psilocybin and DMT, and then there's the phenethylamine-based compounds. So these are the basic, two of the, basically, building blocks that you're starting from, either a tryptamine structure or a phenethylamine structure. But\"},\n",

What's more important, or at least to someone like me, are the receptor effects, and then, ultimately, that's going to have a relationship to the behavioral and subjective effects. So all of these classic psychedelics serve as agonist, or partial agonists, at the serotonin 2A receptor, so a subtype of serotonin receptor. Then you have these other classes of compounds that you could call psychedelic. Another big one would be the NMDA antagonist. So this would include ketamine, PCP, and dextromethorphan, something I've done some research with, which folks might recognize from like Robo-tripping, guzzling cough syrup, which is something kind of like high school kids are known to do when they can't get ahold of real drugs, that type of thing.

In these smoked extracts particularly, people have these reality-altering experiences on par with smoked DMT, the classic psychedelic. So often... And we did the first blinded controlled human research with Salvinorin A. So lots of entity contact. So feeling that you, in the experience of one is actually interacting with autonomous beings, that type of thing.

And I know I'm not telling you anything you don't know, but for the viewers, the primary mechanism of MDMA is serotonin release, and to a degree, other monoamine release, dopamine, serotonin. And so structurally, that's also in the phenethylamine class, which contains mescalin, the classic psychedelic, but also amphetamine. So just like Adderall is in that phenethylamine class.

Not depression, not anxiety. I'm talking about psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, or mania as part of bipolar disorder. And diagnostically, this has shifted.

So even though the legal landscape is very different than with cannabis, there are some similarities. So one of the similarities is, that regardless of what local, municipal, whether the city or state is decriminalized, and that word itself can mean many things. Some forms of decriminalization is close to what folks would call legalization, and others are pretty weak, just saying. We suggest that the police make it their lowest law enforcement priority, that type thing. [interposing voices] - Turn the other cheek kind of thing. - Right.

So, to me, you're... I'm not reviewing your grant. But from a rational perspective, it seems that drugs that increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin or dopamine, in a controlled way, and then coupling that with learning of some sort, sensory input of some sort, it makes sense that would lead to, could, I should say, lead to reordering of circuitry that would allow for better thinking, better mood, many of the same things that you've observed in the clinical trials for depression.

And also, if you've done breath work for those reasons, we have a link for a study of that type up there now, which is a holotropic-style, a very psychedelic-type - Interesting. - of breathing technique that can lead to some of these similar experiences. So it's up there. More broadly, outside of our group, 'cause there's a growing number of groups in the US doing this, and in Europe doing this research, but you can go to Clinicaltrials.gov, and if you look in for the main search term of psilocybin, or MDMA, or psychedelic, plug in those terms, you can get a list of the growing\"},\n",

And it involves two key features that if you can understand those features, and you understand what modulates or changes, our ability to sense those features, there are a lot of things that you can do in terms of how you structure your nutritional practices, how you relate to your exercise practices, perhaps even certain things that you take in terms of supplementation that can basically make you feel better, more alert, and more capable for everything.

Although we don't rule out emotions here at the Huberman Lab podcast, we like emotions, but I'm talking about the heart as an organ, as a beating organ, that circulates blood.

So when we inhale, our lungs fill our diaphragm moves down. Our heart actually has a little more space because the diaphragm's moved down. So the heart gets a little bit bigger, physically bigger, not in the emotional sense, but physically bigger. And as a consequence, whatever blood is in the heart flows at a slower rate because it's a larger volume, so bigger volume heart, same amount of blood inside the heart means slower flow.

This is an autonomic and automatic relationship between the diaphragm, the lungs, the brain, and the heart. Now, if inhale speed the heart up, what happens on exhales? When we exhale, the diaphragm moves up. It's a little counterintuitive, but you can kind of think about it as like pushing the plunge on a syringe, right? When you exhale, this thing moves up and as the diaphragm moves up, the heart has less space.

So this is to me, the simplest and most straightforward example of how the brain is changing the way our organs work, our heart in this case, according to changes in mechanical interoception.

You don't need any sophisticated training. You don't have to do this for minutes on end. You don't have to do anything. You don't even have to call it breathwork.

Most often people forget to hold. So it's inhale, hold, exhale, hold for equal or more or less equal durations, could be one second, could be two seconds, could be three seconds. Most people find that when you get out past five seconds, they start to struggle to maintain the so-called box breathing.

But the point here is that through purely mechanical means changing the way that you breathe, emphasizing inhales or exhales, or keeping them the same will change the way that your brain works, how alert you are and how well you function in anything. And again, this doesn't mean that breathwork has no value. It's just simply to say that long extended protocols of breathwork are simply, they are truly simply just an exploration of this fundamental relationship between the mechanics of your internal organs and your brain and how your brain controls those internal organs.

And as you fill your lungs and these little sacs of air, the alveoli fill, the piezo two receptors because of the way they react to that filling send information by way of a bunch of neurons, a bunch of wires up to the brain and tell you how full your lungs are, so that's the kind of mechanistic detail.

And now let's talk about chemical sensing because there's carbon dioxide and there's oxygen. And this is really simple. You have oxygen and carbon dioxide and you need them both. I sometimes hear people talk about carbon dioxide is this bad thing and oxygen, it has a good thing. You need them both, and you need them in the appropriate balance. You have a collection of neurons in your brain that register when carbon dioxide levels get to a certain point in your bloodstream. When that point, that threshold is reached, these neurons fire, and they cause you to breathe sometimes called the gasp reflex, it just makes you want to inhale.

I'm not going to go into details about how the Hering Breuer reflex works, but it has to do with particular classes of neurons and cells that are called a Baroreceptors. Those are basically pressure receptors, they sense pressure. And basically what the Hering Breuer reflex is about is that when your lung is inflated, your desire to breathe is reduced.

And for those of you with auto-immune conditions, or for those of you that know people with auto-immune conditions, this is going to be a very important discussion. Your gut needs to maintain a certain level of acidity or alkalinity, for those of you without any chemistry background, basically the low numbers on the pH scale, that means more acidic, the higher, the numbers, more alkaline, so more alkaline means more basic and acidic means acidic. And it has to do with whom hydrogen atoms and all this other stuff, but you don't need to worry about that right now.

You may ask, well, why are people taking antacids? Well, those antacids are there for a particular purpose to essentially combat acid reflux, which is the sending up of stuff in the gut towards the esophagus.

And so I'd love your feedback on this, if you, if you agree, please tell me if you disagree, please tell me, but please tell me why you disagree in particular, experience or data, although it's always better if you can point me towards peer reviewed studies. There is a practice that some people embrace. I'm not recommending people necessarily do this.

You want to be very careful with acids of all kinds, truly, but hydrochloric acid is sold as in supplement form in capsule or pill form. And there is a practice of starting to ingest one or two hydrochloric acid tablets midway through a meal and then what people will generally do is examine to see whether or not that improves their symptoms of indigestion, how it relates to mood, how it relates to well-being, how it relates to their sensation of their gut viscera.

So your brain is actually locked behind a gate and that gate is not your skull. That gate is the so-called blood-brain barrier. So just like your gut has these epithelial tight junctions, the things I talked about before that provide a fence, so things can't get through and get through in leaky gut, your brain has tight junctions that are very tight.

This can happen through exercise in hot environments or an inability to escape heat because you don't have covering or adequate ventilation or cooling. It can also be because of excessive fever, for whatever reason. A lot of people think the way to deal with this is to put a cool compress on the back of the neck or to cool the torso.

Actually, most of the time, the vagus is stimulatory. When you ingest foods with amino acids, sugars, or fatty acids, the vagus nerve gets activated and triggers the release of dopamine, it makes you more alert and go seek more of those foods or what led to those conditions. When you feel nauseous it's rarely calming, when you feel like you have a fever, it's rarely calming. So you're starting to get the picture that even though the vagus nerve is in the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system.

I want to say that again, stress will disrupt your gut and make you feel not good, poor digestion, and just lousy, because of the way that it shuts down the vagus nerve and the neurons of your gut.

He is also the host of the Lex Fridman Podcast, which initially started as a podcast focus on technology and science of various kinds, including computer science and physics, but rapidly evolved to include guests and other topics as a matter of focus, including sport. For instance, Dr. Lex Freedman is a Black Belt in Brazilian jujitsu.

As people warm up again there's increased blood flow to the testicles, and in women it seems there's probably increased blood flow to the reproductive organs as well after people warm back up. So that seems to cause some sort of hyper nourishment of the various cells, the Sertoli and Leydig cells of the testes that lead to increased output of testosterone and in women testosterone as well.

The war started where nobody knew whether Kyiv was going to be taken by the Russian forces. It was surrounded. And a lot of experts from outside were convinced that Russia would take Kyiv, and they didn't. And one of the really impressive things as a leader-- one of the things I really experienced is that a lot of people criticized Zelenskyy before the war. He only had about 30% approval rate.

But status is something that is often but not always associated with money, but is a much rarer form of uniqueness out there, a positive uniqueness-- if one considers status positive because there's a downside to.

And then you start to focus more and more and more on making more money, and then you can really deviate and lose track of what is actually good. I'm not saying necessarily Pfizer does that, but I think companies could do that. You can apply that criticism to social media companies, to big pharma companies.

But in computer science everybody was very-- I mean, very relaxed in terms of the stuff they wear so I wanted to try to really take myself seriously and take every single moment seriously and everything I do seriously, and the suit made me feel that way. I don't know how it looks, but it made me feel that way. And I think, in terms of people I look up to that wore a suit that made me think of that is probably Richard Feynman.

And then there's just the Mad Men, that whole era of the '50s, the classiness of that. There's something about a suit that both removes the importance of fashion from the character. You see the person. I think not to-- I forgot who said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel or somebody like this. Is that you wear a shabby dress and everyone sees the dress. You wear a beautiful dress and everybody sees the woman. So in that sense it was-- hopefully I'm quoting that correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good.

I could see that as a parallel to psychedelics, and it's able to create some incredible things. From a conceptual understanding of a thing, it can create incredible art that no human, I think, could have at least easily created through a bit of introduction of randomness.

For me, the black belt was the ceremonial belt, which is not usually the case, because I fought the wars. I trained twice a day for I don't know how many years-- seven, eight years. I competed nonstop. I competed against people much better than me. I competed against many and beaten many black belts and brown belts.

So, in the same way that too much heat is bad for us, too much cold is bad for us, can kill us, can kill neurons, but, appropriately dosed, in an intermittent challenge type of scenario, it can be good for us.

In fact, there have been GWAS studies. These are studies that are genome-wide associated studies, for people listening that aren't familiar. People have a variety of versions of genes, and we have a gene that's able to make heterocyclic amines to basically detoxify it so it's not as harmful.

And there is at least one preliminary study that glutathione is increased in the brain after humans are basically taking sulforaphane. - Which is, really, for people listening, that's so important because a number of compounds that people take in supplement form don't cross the blood-brain barrier, or they get metabolized in ways that what's listed on the bottle almost becomes irrelevant for what your cells actually experience.

So one of the major differences is that fish oil supplements, if you get a high quality one, it's in a triglyceride form. So you've got a glycerol backbone with three fatty acids that's attached, and those are either DHA or the EPA. Or, if you have a lower quality fish oil supplement, then you have what's called ethyl ester form.

You're not going to absorb much of it at all. - Would you see this on the packaging? Is it going to say it's in this ethyl form? - Some official brands will put it on their website, perhaps on their packaging, but, most of the time, you'll have to dig for it on the website and/or call them.

This is something that we're generating from our gut, mostly from our gut permeability, which happens a lot. Endotoxin, it's also called. It's endotoxin lipopolysaccharide. It's basically the outer membrane of bacterial cells when bacteria die, so like when the immune cells in our gut come into contact with the bacteria because we drank alcohol five days in a row or whatever, we release endotoxin, or something stressed us out. We release endotoxin into our body, and that causes inflammation. And so you can inject people with lipopolysaccharide and cause depressive symptoms. However, if you take those same cohort of people, give them EPA, and I think it was somewhere around two grams, and then inject them with lipopolysaccharide. We're establishing causation here, right?

The vagus nerve registers the presence of LPS signals to these particular hyperglycemic areas and cranks up body temperature because, basically, it's a signal that the body is infected. Amazing.

Boy, we've got a lot of things to hit back on because one of your original questions was krill oil versus fish oil. - Yes, still in the cue. - DHA, specifically, in phospholipid form, it's more bioavailable. So, if you're comparing exact quantity or concentration in triglyceride form versus phospholipid form, you will get more in your plasma cells, in your plasma, plasma cell, in your plasma with krill oil. However, krill oil supplements are so low dose. I mean, good luck getting two grams of omega-3 from krill oil. And also, krill oil supplements are notoriously rancid. I don't know for whatever reason. - Maybe that's what made me itchy all over. - I think they're just... I haven't found a good krill oil supplement. I pretty much stay away from it.

And so it's going through a transporter called the MFSD2A transporter. And I think it's very relevant for people with an APOE4 allele, so- - People with an Alzheimer's susceptibility. - Right, so like 25% of the population has an allele and a gene called APOE4, and, basically, it's APOE, but the four is referred to as the bad kind of version of it. This is something in our bodies. It's also in our brain. And if people have one of these versions, if they got one from their mom or their dad, they have a twofold increased risk for Alzheimer's disease.

So there is a role for phospholipid form DHA in the brain, but you also make phospholipid DHA inside your body. And you can do that by taking in more triglyceride forms. So two grams or more is the magic number, I think. So kind of back to the why for fish oil. I personally think it is one of the most powerful, anti-inflammatory things, dietary lifestyle, things that we can get easily, relatively easily, that is going to powerfully modulate the way you think, the way you feel, and the way you age.
